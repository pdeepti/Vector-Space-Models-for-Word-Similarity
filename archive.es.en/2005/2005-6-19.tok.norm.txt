in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , 2006 , following britain 's stint during the second half of 2005 , warned that london can not continue to " force its path on others . "
otherwise , there is a real danger that each member state will only fight for itself , and the concept of a united europe will be left on the wayside . " it 's certainly the question of the concept .
the british want a different europe .
they want more a market-oriented europe , a large market , but no deeper union , " schüssel told ard . a europe for the common good schüssel said he believed german chancellor gerhard schröder was right to say that an economic eu model , such as the one britain envisioned , would mean countries would not act for the common good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel has made eu policy a key issue in his administration " whoever wants such a model leaves behind the european social and economic model , which has served us well , which the citizens want and which has made us strong , " schüssel said . french prime minister dominique de villepin echoed the call to more unity in plotting out europe 's future course .
speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , 2006 , following britain 's stint during the second half of 2005 , warned that london can not continue to " force its path on others . "
otherwise , there is a real danger that each member state will only fight for itself , and the concept of a united europe will be left on the wayside . " it 's certainly the question of the concept .
the british want a different europe .
they want more a market-oriented europe , a large market , but no deeper union , " schüssel told ard . a europe for the common good schüssel said he believed german chancellor gerhard schröder was right to say that an economic eu model , such as the one britain envisioned , would mean countries would not act for the common good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel has made eu policy a key issue in his administration " whoever wants such a model leaves behind the european social and economic model , which has served us well , which the citizens want and which has made us strong , " schüssel said . french prime minister dominique de villepin echoed the call to more unity in plotting out europe 's future course .
speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .

on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .

they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .

sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .
but then on the air show 's opening day , qatar airways reversed the aircrafts fate by buying 60 of the a350 in what the airline said had been a " very hard " choice between the airbus model and boeing 's 787 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin nt 's " boddensee " a historical comeback but the real comeback story of the show was that of the zeppelin nt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .

jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .

their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .

on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .

keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .

on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .

they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .
lingor took one touch to lift it over the stranded norwegian goalkeeper bente nordby from 20 yards to double the advantage . bildunterschrift : germany 's anja mittag scores the first goal against norway 's in the uefa european womens championship final . the humidity eventually broke into a thunderstorm and this brought the norwegians to life .
norway , the only european team to win continental , world and olympic titles , were suddenly a force to be taken seriously . spirited norway stage comeback the first half was nearing its end when winger stine frantzen cut in from the left and split the german defense with a pass which dagny mellgren bravely got on the end of .
shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .
frantzen found the net moments after mellgren 's goal but her powerful right-foot effort was disallowed for offside . germany came out stronger in the second half , with prinz and conny pohlers combining well to trouble the norwegian defense . prinz seals win with killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz but the killer blow did n't come until the 63rd minute when world player of the year and german captain birgit prinz unleashed a shot from distance which took a wicked deflection and wrong-footed nordby to make it 3-1 . the bad luck seemed to extinguish the spirited norwegian comeback despite having chances to get back in the game .
sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .

trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.06.2005 no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil : down and out in hanover after 1-0 loss to mexico mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .
coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.06.2005 public-private partnerships on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you scratch my back and i 'll scratch yours a number of german development agencies are stepping up efforts to integrate private business into their aid projects .
a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .
" any project carried out in cooperation with private business has to be approved by the ministry .
so there are tight controls to ensure that there 's no risk of manipulation .

peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .

" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .

officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours . " in any case , at least more immigrants to germany have a chance to improve their language skills . nadja baeva -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge taking a closer look at integration challenges faced by germany and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .

it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

-lrb- june 19 , 2005 -rrb- germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .
germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 .

penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .

they want more a market-oriented europe , a large market , but no deeper union , " schüssel told ard . a europe for the common good schüssel said he believed german chancellor gerhard schröder was right to say that an economic eu model , such as the one britain envisioned , would mean countries would not act for the common good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel has made eu policy a key issue in his administration " whoever wants such a model leaves behind the european social and economic model , which has served us well , which the citizens want and which has made us strong , " schüssel said . french prime minister dominique de villepin echoed the call to more unity in plotting out europe 's future course .
speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection . " it 's essentially a division between whether you want an eu that is able to cope with the future or whether you want an eu that is trapped in the past , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
" it is not one that europe can dodge . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a mountain of money ? but polish prime minister marek belka , who led a praiseworthy but unsuccessful initiative from the ten newcomer states to sacrifice some of their financial demands for the sake of an amicable budget resolution , said sunday that it was important to show that europe is " more than a mountain of money . " despite the bickering over the budget and the breakdown in talks , eu leaders must demonstrate that the european union is more than a common market , belka stressed . but on the eve of britain 's stint at the eu presidency , exciting eu council president and luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker prophesized a bleak future for europe : " i fear a long , creeping almost imperceptible weakening ... a disparate and blurred future that can not be described .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .
lingor took one touch to lift it over the stranded norwegian goalkeeper bente nordby from 20 yards to double the advantage . bildunterschrift : germany 's anja mittag scores the first goal against norway 's in the uefa european womens championship final . the humidity eventually broke into a thunderstorm and this brought the norwegians to life .
norway , the only european team to win continental , world and olympic titles , were suddenly a force to be taken seriously . spirited norway stage comeback the first half was nearing its end when winger stine frantzen cut in from the left and split the german defense with a pass which dagny mellgren bravely got on the end of .
shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .
frantzen found the net moments after mellgren 's goal but her powerful right-foot effort was disallowed for offside . germany came out stronger in the second half , with prinz and conny pohlers combining well to trouble the norwegian defense . prinz seals win with killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz but the killer blow did n't come until the 63rd minute when world player of the year and german captain birgit prinz unleashed a shot from distance which took a wicked deflection and wrong-footed nordby to make it 3-1 . the bad luck seemed to extinguish the spirited norwegian comeback despite having chances to get back in the game .
sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .
lingor took one touch to lift it over the stranded norwegian goalkeeper bente nordby from 20 yards to double the advantage . bildunterschrift : germany 's anja mittag scores the first goal against norway 's in the uefa european womens championship final . the humidity eventually broke into a thunderstorm and this brought the norwegians to life .
norway , the only european team to win continental , world and olympic titles , were suddenly a force to be taken seriously . spirited norway stage comeback the first half was nearing its end when winger stine frantzen cut in from the left and split the german defense with a pass which dagny mellgren bravely got on the end of .
shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .
frantzen found the net moments after mellgren 's goal but her powerful right-foot effort was disallowed for offside . germany came out stronger in the second half , with prinz and conny pohlers combining well to trouble the norwegian defense . prinz seals win with killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz but the killer blow did n't come until the 63rd minute when world player of the year and german captain birgit prinz unleashed a shot from distance which took a wicked deflection and wrong-footed nordby to make it 3-1 . the bad luck seemed to extinguish the spirited norwegian comeback despite having chances to get back in the game .
sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .

but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .

still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours . " in any case , at least more immigrants to germany have a chance to improve their language skills . nadja baeva -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge taking a closer look at integration challenges faced by germany and europe .

peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .

if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .
but then on the air show 's opening day , qatar airways reversed the aircrafts fate by buying 60 of the a350 in what the airline said had been a " very hard " choice between the airbus model and boeing 's 787 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin nt 's " boddensee " a historical comeback but the real comeback story of the show was that of the zeppelin nt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .
on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup .
-lrb- june 19 , 2005 -rrb- germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .

they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .

jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .

their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .

on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .

they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

otherwise , there is a real danger that each member state will only fight for itself , and the concept of a united europe will be left on the wayside . " it 's certainly the question of the concept .
the british want a different europe .
they want more a market-oriented europe , a large market , but no deeper union , " schüssel told ard . a europe for the common good schüssel said he believed german chancellor gerhard schröder was right to say that an economic eu model , such as the one britain envisioned , would mean countries would not act for the common good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel has made eu policy a key issue in his administration " whoever wants such a model leaves behind the european social and economic model , which has served us well , which the citizens want and which has made us strong , " schüssel said . french prime minister dominique de villepin echoed the call to more unity in plotting out europe 's future course .
speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection . " it 's essentially a division between whether you want an eu that is able to cope with the future or whether you want an eu that is trapped in the past , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , 2006 , following britain 's stint during the second half of 2005 , warned that london can not continue to " force its path on others . "
otherwise , there is a real danger that each member state will only fight for itself , and the concept of a united europe will be left on the wayside . " it 's certainly the question of the concept .
the british want a different europe .
they want more a market-oriented europe , a large market , but no deeper union , " schüssel told ard . a europe for the common good schüssel said he believed german chancellor gerhard schröder was right to say that an economic eu model , such as the one britain envisioned , would mean countries would not act for the common good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel has made eu policy a key issue in his administration " whoever wants such a model leaves behind the european social and economic model , which has served us well , which the citizens want and which has made us strong , " schüssel said . french prime minister dominique de villepin echoed the call to more unity in plotting out europe 's future course .
speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .

according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours . " in any case , at least more immigrants to germany have a chance to improve their language skills . nadja baeva -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge taking a closer look at integration challenges faced by germany and europe .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .
" any project carried out in cooperation with private business has to be approved by the ministry .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours . " in any case , at least more immigrants to germany have a chance to improve their language skills . nadja baeva -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge taking a closer look at integration challenges faced by germany and europe .

" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction .

according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .
" any project carried out in cooperation with private business has to be approved by the ministry .
so there are tight controls to ensure that there 's no risk of manipulation .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .

speaking at the paris air show on sunday , villepin called on all eu members to work towards common strategic goals .
now more than ever it is important that europe pursues a " common vision " to help it overcome " one of the deepest crises in its history , " he said , pointing to cooperation in the aviation branch as one of the bloc 's key economic successes . updating europe while france and germany in particular , are pointing fingers at the british boogeyman , british government officials are putting a more positive spin on the budget meltdown .
the summit fiasco actually creates an opportunity for blair to lead europe in a different , more " modern , " economically liberal direction when he takes over the presidency on july 1 . they relish the sharpening ideological clash between their free-market philosophy and what they see as an outdated franco-german model of social and rural protection .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .

a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .
lingor took one touch to lift it over the stranded norwegian goalkeeper bente nordby from 20 yards to double the advantage . bildunterschrift : germany 's anja mittag scores the first goal against norway 's in the uefa european womens championship final . the humidity eventually broke into a thunderstorm and this brought the norwegians to life .
norway , the only european team to win continental , world and olympic titles , were suddenly a force to be taken seriously . spirited norway stage comeback the first half was nearing its end when winger stine frantzen cut in from the left and split the german defense with a pass which dagny mellgren bravely got on the end of .
shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .
frantzen found the net moments after mellgren 's goal but her powerful right-foot effort was disallowed for offside . germany came out stronger in the second half , with prinz and conny pohlers combining well to trouble the norwegian defense . prinz seals win with killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz but the killer blow did n't come until the 63rd minute when world player of the year and german captain birgit prinz unleashed a shot from distance which took a wicked deflection and wrong-footed nordby to make it 3-1 . the bad luck seemed to extinguish the spirited norwegian comeback despite having chances to get back in the game .
sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .

but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .

shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .

sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.06.2005 air show highlights europe 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 steels the show the paris air show showcased the future of flight , from superjumbos to midsize aircraft .
even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .
but then on the air show 's opening day , qatar airways reversed the aircrafts fate by buying 60 of the a350 in what the airline said had been a " very hard " choice between the airbus model and boeing 's 787 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin nt 's " boddensee " a historical comeback but the real comeback story of the show was that of the zeppelin nt .
another european aviation project , the new generation of dirigibles is expected to revolutionize the surveillance market .
the giant balloons which can make fly-overs or remain stationary are expected to find widespread uses in monitoring a range of situations from maritime oil spills to road traffic control , forest fires and air quality tests . its manufacturer , a tie-up between sofema groupe of france and zeppelin luftschifftechnik of germany , assured that new technologies make the dirigible much safer than their reputation .
zeppelins fell out of favor in the aviation sector following the 1937 fire and crash of the hindenburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leadership row leaves eads grounded the bitter power struggle at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has put the company in an embarrassing spot as it appears leaderless at the prestigious international paris air show this week .

even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .
but then on the air show 's opening day , qatar airways reversed the aircrafts fate by buying 60 of the a350 in what the airline said had been a " very hard " choice between the airbus model and boeing 's 787 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin nt 's " boddensee " a historical comeback but the real comeback story of the show was that of the zeppelin nt .
another european aviation project , the new generation of dirigibles is expected to revolutionize the surveillance market .
the giant balloons which can make fly-overs or remain stationary are expected to find widespread uses in monitoring a range of situations from maritime oil spills to road traffic control , forest fires and air quality tests . its manufacturer , a tie-up between sofema groupe of france and zeppelin luftschifftechnik of germany , assured that new technologies make the dirigible much safer than their reputation .

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .

even dirigibles made a comeback .
but above all , the week-long event highlighted europe 's contribution to aviation . hundreds of thousands of visitors descended on the airfield at le bourget near paris for the final day of the weeklong air show sunday .
after the exhibit had been restricted to professionals for the first four days , the stands and displays of some 1,900 aviation manufacturers from 41 countries focused on showing off their contributions to the future of flight . in the commercial aircraft sector , competing visions of flight services found a certain balance in superjumbo and midsize aircraft initiatives launched by airbus and boeing , respectively .
the much hyped competition between the two rival manufacturers found expression in the air show 's two key attractions : the airbus a380 boeing 's 787 . airbus 's new a380 , the world 's largest commercial airplane , exemplifies the european aircraft maker 's belief in strong demand for an aircraft that can deliver masses of passengers to major hub destinations such as heathrow and singapore . the long-haul superjumbo , capable of carrying up to 840 people , is to be delivered to launch carrier singapore airlines in late 2006 for its first real commercial flights . bildunterschrift : the a380 takes its maiden flight over southwestern france , april 27 , 2005 . for its part , us manufacturer boeing , announced it would decide next month whether to launch a bigger and better version of its 747 , whose dominance on the jumbo market since the 1970s is threatened by the european newcomer . big competition for midsize aircraft meanwhile boeing is also placing its bets on developments in the midsize market , where it hopes to get a one-up on airbus .
the us aviator 's new 787 dreamliner was conceived with the expectation that passengers prefer to fly point-to-point rather than having to change planes at busy hubs .
the chicago-based company built the plane using a high proportion of composite materials to save on fuel and maintenance costs , giving some relief to airlines plagued with soaring fuel bills . launched in april 2004 and due to enter service in 2008 with japanese carrier all nippon airways , the 787 has won 266 orders and commitments from 21 airlines . not to be left out , airbus quickly jumped into the competition with its a350 .
still on the drawing boards , with an official launch delayed until late september , the a350 only had 10 commitments to buy and 20 more tentative prior to this week 's show .
but then on the air show 's opening day , qatar airways reversed the aircrafts fate by buying 60 of the a350 in what the airline said had been a " very hard " choice between the airbus model and boeing 's 787 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin nt 's " boddensee " a historical comeback but the real comeback story of the show was that of the zeppelin nt .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .

shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .

sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .
the greeks have rarely shown the desire or confidence to beat teams in their competitive games since portugal . something wrong , but what exactly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if it is still a hangover from those heady days , it 's time someone got them some alka-seltzer .
maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .
the world champions were top of group b on goal difference at the start of the day with mexico in second . japan took the top spot after the win over greece but will vacate it if either mexico or brazil win in hanover .
the final day of group b takes on special significance now with three teams vying for two spots . unfortunately , greece wo n't be one of them . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .
" any project carried out in cooperation with private business has to be approved by the ministry .
so there are tight controls to ensure that there 's no risk of manipulation .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.06.2005 no masterpiece from brazil 's soccer artists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil : down and out in hanover after 1-0 loss to mexico mexico provide the first big surprise in the confederations cup by knocking off world champs brazil , 1-0 .
coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's goalkeeper dida -lrb- left -rrb- saves mexico 's jared borgetti third , and final , penalty attempt and he succeeded .
yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .
mexico in semifinals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's supporters could celebrate once mexico scored in the second half , brazil had no true answers to getting past the green wall that was the mexican defense .
keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .
a draw would suffice for brazil ; a second surprise against the south americans is hardly likely .
the surprise may come for the winner of the argentina-germany match when and if they must come up against the world champs . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

coach ricardo la volpe 's side showed no weaknesses in shutting down the selecao . argentina and germany are in a dilemma .
they expected to be playing for the group a title on tuesday with the prize being a semi-final not against brazil .
now those smooth plans must be put on ice after mexico shut down the selecao from south america , 1-0 .
jared borgetti scored the lone goal on a 59th-minute header as the brazilian defense slumbered on a corner kick , allowing mexico 's strongest head ball player unhindered access to the ball .
keeper dida had no chance and his defenders ' nap was a fatal one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the gamewinning goal against brazil for mexico and coach ricardo la volpe , it was further proof that their 20-game unbeaten streak , despite some victories coming against " mighty " opponents like the dominican republic or panama , is no fluke .
their last loss , by the way , was a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of the brazilians in last year 's copa america .
brazil 's nemesis the copa america loss last year was more the exception than the rule for mexico against brazil .
in numerous matches in the recent past , mexico has walked off the field a winner .
one of the reason 's has been a menacing defense that allows the artists of south america to play their style of ball - namely fast-paced and pretty .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- but when two defenders immediately covered the likes of playmakers ronaldinho , and kaka or striker star robinho when they touched the ball within 30 meters of the mexcian net , well , things wo n't be pretty .
the opportunities for brazil were far and few between and more coincidence than the result of a grand series of passes .
the only time they managed to find the net , on a beautiful header by adriano in the 68th minute , referee roberto rosetti disallowed it for offsides .
that was the right call but probably the most interesting scenario of the balmy evening in hanover started in the 28th minute .
penalty kicks galore but no goal borgetti was pulled down in the brazilian penalty box by roque junior .
rosetti immediately pointed at the penalty spot despite the fact that borgetti had no chance of reaching the intended cross for him .
nevertheless , the brazilians hardly complained as borgetti took the ball to convert the penalty himself .

yet , rosetti meticulously followed the rules and ordered the kick be retaken for a mexican teammate entered the box a fraction of a second too early .
on the second attempt , borgetti launched a rocket into the crossbar ; brazil could breathe a sigh of relief .
but no , rosetti ordered a third attempt .
brazil 's emerson had run into the box prematurely .
on the third attempt , borgetti spoke his third prayer before a penalty , and was denied by dida .
the whole event took almost five minutes to complete .
brazil who has dominated up to that point , took another five minutes to gather their composure after that shock .

keeper oswaldo sanchez played solidly and had to make some clutch saves but was never truly challenged by the selecao .
they in the meantime must still fight for that final spot in the semifinals .
on wednesday , they come up against japan who have played exciting soccer in their first two matches .

on sunday , japan cut them down to size and dumped them out of the confed cup . japan ended the hopes of the greeks lifting another major international trophy by beating otto rehhagel 's side 1-0 in frankfurt . the dream of adding the confederations cup to the european championship trophy had already been rudely interrupted by the sublime brazilians on thursday but many saw this as a result in the natural order of things .
this defeat raises worrying questions about the current standing of greece . japan could have run up a rugby score over the woeful greeks whose only consolation was that they missed fewer chances than the profligate japanese .
however , japan created far more chances and would have humiliated the greeks had it not been for their inability to hit a barn door from five yards . greece caught flat-footed by lively japanese bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it is , greece just did n't get going and did n't even show any of their smash and grab heroics which brought the european championship trophy to athens last summer . the asian champions looked more fleet of foot and displayed a maverick style of attack that at times had greece pulled over the pitch .
it was a shame , and a relief for greece , that their flowing football was so undisciplined in the final third of the pitch . japan 's strikers atsushi yanagisawa and keiji tamada should be made to relinquish the title of attackers after being guilty of a series of appalling misses in what soon became a one-sided game . japan finally find the net after glaring misses the japanese goal in 77th minute was not a classic either and it will have hurt the greeks to have defended well against far superior chances only to have fallen to a case of lazyitis .
a sloppy pass out of the defense was slotted through the rigid back four by shunsuke nakamura for substitute masashi oguro to poke home past an exposed antonis nikopolidis . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro scores the winning goal it was a bitter blow for the greeks who will wonder if the game would have turned their way in 52nd minute after it looked like they had been robbed of a penalty when angelos charisteas looked to have been hauled down in the penalty area . however , for the greeks to complain about that decision in the wake of such a weak capitulation will seem like a spent force clutching at straws .

maybe opponents have found them out ; maybe they were just lucky last summer , maybe a new generation deserves a chance .
trouble is there appears to be few younger stars coming through to carry the dream on .
greece look in trouble . nothing should be taken away from greece for their euro 2004 win and two defeats does not mean a return to international mediocrity , especially when one was a master class by the world champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but greece do not look happy and have struggled in both games .
losing to japan a year after dispensing with france , the czech republic and portugal should be seen as a symptom that something is wrong . japan in with semi-final shout the japanese win lifts them up into a potential semi-final position with mexico and brazil playing in the later game .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 . following the collapse of the european union summit over a bitter budget dispute , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel took british prime minister tony blair to task for putting national interests above those of the 25-member bloc .
britain , which insisted on retaining its five-billion euro rebate despite opposition from the other 24 member states , has been widely criticized for torpedoing the 2007-2013 budget compromise . speaking in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard , schüssel acknowledged that britain was not the only country to veto the proposed budget .
but blair 's stubborn refusal to yield on the issue of britain 's paybacks unless changes were made to extensive – and in his opinion overly inflated – agricultural subsidies has set a negative precedent for future negotiations in which each member state thinks only of itself .
schüssel , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , 2006 , following britain 's stint during the second half of 2005 , warned that london can not continue to " force its path on others . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2005 spain , poland protest gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : church takes to the streets in spain conservatives in europe took to the streets again this weekend .
in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .
with an endorsement from the newly appointed pope benedict xvi , the alliance mobilized voters , particularly those in rural regions , to abstain from voting on a government referendum to change what is europe 's strictest fertility laws . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

in the predominately catholic spain and poland , religious groups protested against gay marriage as an assault on family values . flanked by church clerics , hundreds of thousands of spaniards marched through the streets of madrid saturday to protest against a proposal by the socialist government to put gay marriage on an equal footing with heterosexual unions – something only belgium and the netherlands have managed to achieve . organizers , who insisted the march was pro-family and not anti-gay , said some 1.5 to 2 million protestors had turned out to show their stance on the historical legislation .
according to government counts , there were only 166,000 participants .
the march was the third in just as many weeks . lead by 20 catholic bishops , including the archbishop of madrid , the march was supported by the conservative opposition popular party .
the two groups called out to spaniards of all ages to show their disapproval of parliament 's passage of a law legalizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children for gay couples .
although the law has passed the lower house , it still needs senate approval to go into force ; and many are hoping that it will fail .
if it passes , however , it will be one of europe 's most liberal laws regarding gay rights . church and politics mix united under the banner of traditional family values with mottos such as " marriage equals man and woman , " and " a child 's right to mother and father , " the protest over the gay marriage law marks the first time in more than 20 years that the catholic church has involved itself in spanish politics . although polls show some 95 percent of spaniards consider themselves catholic , only around 25 percent of them go to church .
a majority of them also support the gay marriage legislation put forth by spain 's prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero and see it as an important step forward for civil rights in the country , which until 1975 was ruled by catholic nationalist dictator francisco franco , who banned homosexuality . no where else in europe , except for the netherlands , has a government pushed for such a liberal law on gay marriage and adoption .
in belgium gay and heterosexual marriage are considered equal , but the question of adoption is still undecided .
in germany and scandinavia homosexual " unions " – not marriages - are recognized by law , but adoption is still not possible . defending normality meanwhile , in warsaw hundreds of people hit the streets to protest last week 's gay and lesbian parade .
the 800 participants , mostly members of the nationalist polish family league , called their march a " normal parade . "
they carried polish flags and banners with the words " yes to family , no to abnormality , " or " a girl and a boy , that 's normal . " " we are here because we want to protect certain moral values and traditions and the notion that a family consists of a man and a woman , " said 18-year-old kacper maczak .
in front of the parliament building , the representative for family league , robert strak said : " we are here to show that poland is a normal country and that abnormality is not welcome .
we are the home of pope john paul ii .
there is no place for abnormality here . " catholic europe only a week ago , conservative politicians and the catholic church joined forces to protest against italy 's fertility laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.06.2005 promoting germany 's language melting pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new legislation aims to encourage foreigners to become part of society since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .
but now all immigrants with permanent or long-term residence may enroll in the classes .
and the german authorities can oblige people whose language skills are weak to take part in the classes .
learn german or else " we know there are many children who do n't speak german when they start school , " said erwin schindler , who heads the integration course department at the federal agency for migration and refugees .
" we know there are districts in big cities that practically have their own foreign population which does n't speak german .
and lacking linguistic skills in some cases leads to problems such as unemployment , and to social problems .
thus , it was obvious a solution had to be found to more intensively promote participation in these things . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : course participants spend 30 hours learning about german society it 's up to the state immigration authorities to decide whether a person 's german is n't up to scratch .
if officials notice that applicants for residence permits or renewals can not communicate in simple german , they send them to language classes .
officials at unemployment offices can also recommend foreign jobseekers and social welfare recipients for the courses , and if they refuse to take the classes their benefits will be cut . the measures are meant to help people who have n't yet become part of german society to become more quickly integrated .
according to schindler , some people just have to be forced to do what 's good for them . " the whole integration course should be seen under the heading ' encourage and demand . '
and part of encouraging is also obliging someone to participate , and part of it is also - according to one 's ability - paying an individual contribution for the course , " schindler said . people who take the classes pay one euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- per hour .
the fee is waived for those who ca n't afford it - which includes most of the participants .
heterogeneity important bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classes bring people from different countries together the integration courses are made up of two parts : 600 hours of language instruction and 30 hours of an orientation class .
in the latter , foreigners learn about germany 's history , culture and legal system . after her experiences working with ethnic germans from the former soviet union , gudrun harhoff from cologne 's faw pointed out that one of the strengths of the new courses is the requirement that the participants are a heterogeneous mixture , bringing together people who speak different languages , so that german becomes their means of communication . all in all , harhoff has only identified one deficiency to the new system : " these three groups , refugees , asylum seekers and ethnic germans , who benefited from employment office backing experience a reduction .
it 's reduced to a maximum of 600 hours of language learning , and earlier it was a good 900 hours . " in any case , at least more immigrants to germany have a chance to improve their language skills . nadja baeva -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge taking a closer look at integration challenges faced by germany and europe .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .
" any project carried out in cooperation with private business has to be approved by the ministry .
so there are tight controls to ensure that there 's no risk of manipulation .

a relationship of seeming mutual benefit , are " public private partnerships " good news for everyone ? in some parts of the world , getting sick can be a fatal blow .
being unable to work when you live on the breadline is bad enough , but what 's worse , medical treatment is likely to be prohibitively expensive .
according to gabriele ramm from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , falling ill in a developing country can fast become a matter of life and death . " people are forced to work under appalling conditions , without any kind of safety precautions , on construction sites or in factories where they 're dealing with toxic chemicals , " she said .
" they 're regularly exposed to various factors that will make them susceptible to illness , and inevitably have no access to medical care . " protecting against crises in india , for example , 93 percent of the workforce earns its living without ever having signed any kind of contract , and therefore fails to pay any social contributions .
to combat the problem , the gtz and the german allianz insurance company have developed what they call micro-insurance schemes .
these allow locals in primarily rural regions of india , such as farmers , trades-and craftspeople and owners of small businesses , to insure themselves against accident , illness , invalidity and natural disasters at affordable rates - as low as 20 cents a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " micro-insurance schemes are a protection against crisis situations , and available to people who fall through the net of other systems , " explained ramm .
" they work on the same principle as other insurance schemes , but there are certain conditions .
standard insurance structures are too costly for the poorer members of society , which means that we have to develop other options .
we concentrate on group contracts - we do n't offer many individual policies , because it would be too expensive .
and in order to process these contracts we rely on middle men . " a question of trust that 's where the indian ngos come into the equation .
teaming up with a development aid agency is one way for a company to test the waters of a potential new market and boost its image , while in return , the organization gets to benefit from its partner 's commercial clout - the condition of getting on board being that the business partner takes over at least 50 percent of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural cooperatives collect the contributions from scheme members and take over the claims investigations and settlements .
as group insurers , they can negotiate optimal rates and also enjoy the trust of the people - who often need to be told why it 's worth being insured in the first place . the plan has already proved successful .
in tamil nadu , some 60,000 people signed up for a life insurance with the help of the ngo " activists for social alternatives , " under the aegis of the indian-german joint venture bajaj allianz . allianz is well aware that these small-scale insurance schemes will never make mega-bucks , but the company is optimistic that it 's tapping into a potential mass market .
meanwhile , the gtz gets to assemble a welfare net for impoverished members of indian society - a service that would have remained a pipe-dream without the know-how of a commercial insurer . taking advantage it 's a win-win situation .
but are these public private partnerships swallowing public development funds - in other words , taxpayers ' money - which companies could invest on their own initiative ?
gabriele ramm is familiar with the suspicion that companies might take advantage of these ppps , but she explained that the ministry for economic cooperation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has taken due precautions : " the bmz set up the concept in 1999 and fleshed out some very stringent stipulations , " she said .

half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . walter peters is one of fifteen immigrants to germany learning the language of their new home at cologne 's faw training center .
peters , an ethnic german from russia , and his arab , moroccan , polish and turkish classmates are among the first people to take part in germany 's so-called integration courses .
initial reactions to the 2,300 such classes currently underway have been positive . " at the moment , i 'm positively surprised , " said gudrun harhoff , head of faw 's language department .
" i really have the feeling that we have groups that are very motivated and can also learn .
the thing that 's fundamentally positive is that all immigrants can take advantage of language instruction . " indeed , until the immigration law came into effect in january , publicly financed language courses were only available for certain people , such as ethnic germans , foreign workers and refugees .
foreign spouses of german citizens had to pay for language lessons out of their own pockets .

birgit prinz celebrates germany 's third goal germany added the european championship title to their current mantle of world champions when they beat norway 3-1 to win their fourth successive uefa european women 's championship in blackburn on sunday . on a hot summer 's day in deepest lancashire , both teams toiled in temperatures creeping into the lower thirties but it was germany who took the lead through anja mittag who poked in a goal bound inka grings shot after a well-worked corner in the 21st minute . it was n't long before the germans were 2-0 up .
just three minutes later , germany 's britta carlson took advantage of a break down in the norwegian attack to put her midfield partner renate lingor clear of norway 's exposed defense with a sublimely lobbed pass .
lingor took one touch to lift it over the stranded norwegian goalkeeper bente nordby from 20 yards to double the advantage . bildunterschrift : germany 's anja mittag scores the first goal against norway 's in the uefa european womens championship final . the humidity eventually broke into a thunderstorm and this brought the norwegians to life .
norway , the only european team to win continental , world and olympic titles , were suddenly a force to be taken seriously . spirited norway stage comeback the first half was nearing its end when winger stine frantzen cut in from the left and split the german defense with a pass which dagny mellgren bravely got on the end of .
shrugging off a physical tackle , mellgren retained composure to poke the ball past the oncoming german goalkeeper silke rottenberg . the norwegians were revitalized and nearly ended the half with parity .
frantzen found the net moments after mellgren 's goal but her powerful right-foot effort was disallowed for offside . germany came out stronger in the second half , with prinz and conny pohlers combining well to trouble the norwegian defense . prinz seals win with killer blow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa women 's soccer player of the year , birgit prinz but the killer blow did n't come until the 63rd minute when world player of the year and german captain birgit prinz unleashed a shot from distance which took a wicked deflection and wrong-footed nordby to make it 3-1 . the bad luck seemed to extinguish the spirited norwegian comeback despite having chances to get back in the game .
sixteen-year-old substitute isabell herlovsen went close with 20 minutes left when her close-range volley flew straight into rottenberg 's arms and , as time ebbed away , her colleagues seemed to run out of ideas . a fitting end to a glittering career in the end , the three goals were enough to hand the germans their sixth european title since the tournament began in 1984 and to give their coach tina theune-meyer a last trophy to celebrate in her final game as germany coach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tina theune-meyer with the trophy in the bag , the germans paid an emotional tribute to their coach on the winner 's podium , handing her the silver and glass cup and bowing to her in acknowledgement of a career that has brought the biggest prizes in women 's soccer to germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german soccer women upstaging the men while most of the nation obsesses about germany 's chances in the confederations cup , another national soccer team has quietly made their way into the final of the european championships .

researchers from three us centres found men exposed to a high amount of sun had half the risk of the disease than those exposed to a low amount .
writing in cancer research , they suggest that the protection was a result of the body 's manufacture of vitamin d after sun exposure .
but men were warned not to sunbathe excessively because of the risk of developing skin cancer .
vitamin d is also found in foods such as oily fish .
experts from the northern california cancer center , the keck school of medicine of the university of southern california , and the comprehensive cancer center of wake forest university all worked on the study .
they looked at 450 white patients aged 40 to 79 with advance prostate cancer , from san francisco .
for most people , it usually takes just a few minutes of sun exposure for your skin to make a very large amount of vitamin d henry scowcroft , cancer research uk they compared them with a group of 455 men of similar ages and backgrounds who did not have prostate cancer .
the men were all asked whether their jobs had involved working outside , and if so , how regularly they did this .
the scientists also looked at the difference between pigmentation in underarm skin which is usually not exposed to sunlight , and forehead skin , which is .
to do this , they used a portable reflectometer - a device which measures skin tone by emitting light and assessing the amount that is reflected back , giving a reading on the colour of the skin from 0 to 100 .
the difference in scores taken from underarms and foreheads provided an indication of how much exposure to the sun men had experienced .
the risk of prostate cancer was found to be halved in men who had the highest amount of sun exposure - an average of 20 hours a week , or more .
gene variants previous research has shown that the prostate uses vitamin d to promote the normal growth of prostate cells and to inhibit the invasiveness and spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body .
men need more evidence-based research to know how to balance the risks and benefits chris hiley , prostate cancer charity genes determine how the body processes vitamin d. they control receptors which vary in their ability to bind to the vitamin and therefore influence the behaviour of cells .
dna tests carried out by the researchers showed the risk of prostate cancer was reduced by up to 65 % in men with certain gene variants .
dr esther john , of the northern california cancer centre , who led the research , said : " we believe that sunlight helps to reduce the risk of prostate cancer because the body manufactures the active form of vitamin d from exposure to sunlight . "
she added that if future studies continued to suggest this link , increasing vitamin d intake from food and supplements might be the safest solution to achieve the right levels .
chris hiley , head of policy and research at the prostate cancer charity , warned that while increased exposure to sunlight might decrease the risk of prostate cancer , it also increased the risk of skin cancer .
" men need more evidence-based research to know how to balance the risks and benefits . "
henry scowcroft , of cancer research uk , also cautioned that more work was needed to weigh up the risks involved .
" for most people , it usually takes just a few minutes of sun exposure for your skin to make a very large amount of vitamin d , " he added .

but opponents of the £ 12m scheme , which is said to be the first of its kind in scotland , have said they will continue their opposition to the development .
racing bosses want to change the existing turf track , so meetings would not be affected by the weather .
east lothian planning officials will now scrutinise the latest proposals .
backers of the scheme , which would enable racing after dusk , have revised their plans in the light of previous complaints .
anger has focussed on potential noise and light pollution and impact on the historic golf course in the middle of the circuit .
it is said to be the oldest in the world still being played regularly .
even if the plans are approved , construction work will not start until next year .

swansea council has published its proposals , which include the closure of several smaller schools and the creation of a new welsh medium primary .
the consultation exercise will see parents at every school involved in the planned changes asked for their views .
swansea council said parents ' views would be taken into account when the decision on the proposals was made .
pupils transferred a final decision is expected to be made by the cabinet following a meeting in august .
the proposals include a recommendation that dylan thomas school , in the cockett area of the city , should be closed and the pupils transferred to bishop gore in sketty .
dylan thomas school has 1,500 children in its catchment area but only attracts around 550 pupils , although many parents have begun a campaign to keep it open .
other proposals include the closure of garnswllt primary school and the transfer of its pupils transferred to other schools in the area .
if approved , the plans will also see bryn nursery close and the pupils there transfer to townhill primary school .
there are also plans to open a new teaching facility for children with special needs at pontarddulais comprehensive school and a new-build welsh medium primary school at west cross .
the proposals for school reorganisation were discussed by the council 's cabinet last week , but swansea council cabinet member for education , mike day , said no final decisions had yet been made : he added : " last week 's cabinet made no decision to close any school .
" the cabinet is prepared to listen and take into account any ideas put forward .
" the priority is to satisfy the education needs of the children of swansea over the coming years , " he said .
" if they are implemented , they will help strengthen schools in their communities .
" but we recognise that there are other strong views out there and those views must be heard before cabinet takes a position . "
a consultation document is being sent to every parent at all the schools involved .
the consultation process ends on 13 july .

the rcn says the government 's scheme to help public sector workers get onto the property ladder has failed to help thousands in places like london .
the government says its initiative , the key worker living scheme , has a limited allocation of funds .
but the rcn says more money should be put into the scheme .
it also wants to see it extended outside the south east to other areas where workers currently get no help .
the key worker living scheme helps workers buy homes by offering them loans of up to £ 50,000 , or shared ownership schemes .
it is open to other public sector workers , such as police officers and teachers , but excludes nurses employed outside the nhs in private and charity sectors , as well as overseas nurses in the uk on work permits .
' over-stretched ' in its first year , the scheme helped 653 nurses in the south east .
so far this year , the scheme has received 25,000 applications , of which 5,197 are completed or are at an advanced stage .
but the government has revealed the scheme 's money is almost fully committed in some areas after just two months .
practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work laura jeffrey , neonatal staff nurse ' i ca n't afford my own home ' the rcn says nurses frustrated at not being able to afford to buy homes are having to find better paid jobs or take on extra work .
" we 've had examples where a senior nurse is talking about becoming a plumber because the wages are better and he can make sure that he has access to a home , " said rcn general secretary beverly malone .
" when you are 42 and you still ca n't buy a home , or even get close to buying one , then you are in great trouble . "
claire cannings , the rcn 's welfare officer , said the scheme was " fantastic " for those it helped , but added that it could seem " divisive and extremely unfair " for those who were not eligible .
existing property laura jeffrey , a 23-year-old neonatal staff nurse at leeds royal infirmary , is one of those not covered .
" it seems extremely unfair that i 'm excluded from the scheme because i am not nursing in the south , " she said .
" practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work . "
the government said the scheme was targeted at areas where it was hardest to recruit and retain staff .
it has also changed the scheme so key workers can apply to improve an existing property into a family home .
a spokesman for the office of the deputy prime minister , which oversees the scheme , said : " people may have problems buying a property , but if they are not in an area where there is a recruitment and retention issue , the scheme does not operate .
" staffing levels are monitored by the relevant departments , such as the department of health . "
should the government spend more on helping key workers buy homes ?
are you a trained nurse who has had to relocate , find a better paid job or take on extra work to get on the property ladder ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : i am a trained nurse , as is my wife .
we have had to fight tooth and nail to get a council house -lrb- indeed actually separating at one point -rrb- because we could not get any where near buying a house , even with the government scheme .
if we had not got this house , we would have moved -lrb- as we were on the verge of doing so anyway -rrb- to nottingham , as it was the only place we could afford to buy , and then only just .
i have just been promoted to senior staff nurse , meaning a lot of the time i am responsible for up to 28 patients care , as well as staff .
for this i get paid the grand sum of £ 19000 pa , when every day someone could die and its my responsibility .
i think rather than come up with gimmick schemes for housing in the worst areas , the government would be better served paying nurses to reflect the job they do .
graham , harlow , essex unaffordable housing is a bigger issue than simply for " key workers " .
i do n't think taxpayers money is best spent on schemes which are essentially marginal in nature .
phil lucas , derby it 's ridiculous that nurses who provide an essential service to the public are so undervalued that their wages do not allow them to buy homes .
the government should help them as much as they can .
stuart forsyth , hamilton , south lanarkshire i agree with beverly malone 's observation- but perhaps the problem is a structural one .
the inability of salaries to keep pace with house price inflation is more far-reaching than just the health sector , and affects many even in the north .
teachers , as well as other public sector workers are all similarly affected .
perhaps the problem would right itself with a house-price collapse-but how many would be worse-off then ?
only the government can help , but this frankly is unlikely .
there may be trouble ahead .
john flanagan , sunderland , uk there are a great many people in the uk who can not afford to buy a house .
why should the likes of nurses be given preferential treatment ?
as for the notion of " key workers " , surely the likes of bin men and bus drivers are key workers ?
should we subsidise them ?
how many workers in the uk are on minimum wages ?
nurses are not on minimum wages are they ?
also , how many nurses are married to the likes of policemen and firemen ?
put another way , we should spotlight family income as opposed to individual income .
john bowes , greenock i totally agree that more money should be made available not only to allow those in the nhs to buy homes but also help retain trained staff , what is the point of the nhs spending so much money on training only to lose it when staff leave for better paid jobs .
wages in the nhs are in need of a significant boost .
i am sure we all agree those that give their lives in the service of others should be rewarded .
raise tax .
tax the richest , lets have a better healthcare for all .
kingsley knights , guildford nurses get a generous bursary to study and get all their tuition fees paid .
they then start off on quite a competitive graduate salary of over £ 18,000 a year .
i think there 's a lot of graduates much worse off in low paid work with debts of thousands from student loans .
what nurses lack in immediate income they gain in job security .
alex , cambridge buying a house is not a right - on the continent there is n't the same pressure to be a home owner - the government should not be propping up the over-priced housing market in this way , but encouraging sensible renting and , probably , joint purchases .
this is a complete nonsense of a scheme .
robert steadman , matlock , united kingdom i 'm a nurse here in the states who has been seriously thinking of moving to england .
of course , i 'd seek work as a nurse , there , too .
this makes me stop and think since i 'm a single parent and the only income .
i would say that a nurse is a key worker since hospitals can hardly run without us .
i would not want to have to take a second job after working as hard as i do all day .
one does n't get all that training and obtain a license only to continue struggling to survive .
there would be no point in working as a nurse if that were the case , unless you were already independently wealthy .
christine conway , nyc , usa why should these so called ' key sector ' workers get assistance on buying a property ?
if they ca n't afford a property on their current salary , then they should find another job .
this amounts to discrimination against millions of private sector workers who are just as important .
paul turnbull , gateshead , tyne & wear if it had n't been for thatcher in the 80 's telling people that they should buy a house , there 'd be plenty of cheap , rented accommodation available still probably .
but no .
people from key sectors are moving into yet more insurance and banking jobs , leaving the really important areas to suffer .
i know a great deal of people would hate to hear this , but we need a property price crash .
its just getting silly .
david rickard , bucks no .
they should pay them more .
if they can not afford to pay them more then the numbers should reduce and the service should begin to fail , at that point the people will see they are not being paid enough and then accept that they have to pay more tax , or tax the rich more and then pay them more .
shaun maunder , ipswich why is so much attention given to key workers ?
what about the rest of us who are in similarly paid work , independent and still unable to get on to the property ladder ?
we are just as important .
caroline , maidenhead , uk nurses in cumbria are awaiting their historic victory for equal pay ... £ 27,000 for staff nurses. because this was a unison and not an rcn victory the rcn naturally are trying to sell their agenda for change pay structure which will leave most nurses worse off , that is someone who has studied for 3 years , has a job that requires clinical judgement be it dispensing medication to cardiac arrest , to simply feeding and cleaning the infirm , to documenting all the above , will still be paid less than a fireman , policeman or teacher or even an nhs electrician , plumber , carpenter etc sonya , north east i am a registered nurse in the us .
the same issue occurs here where nurses are unable to purchase homes and their standard of living -lrb- and relative wages -rrb- has declined over the last 20 years - while physician and health administrators incomes have soared .
the real issue is that not only do nurses have little power over their professional situation -lrb- work hours , salary , benefits -rrb- , they are undervalued by society at large .
it is important that society value nurses as much , if not more so , than physicians and managers .
nothing the physicians do will help if an adequate number of well educated nurses is not available for assisting patients to achieve optimal health and wellness .
no business model will work to assure the health of individuals and society if nurses are not included as an integral and important component for planning and implementing the model .
including nurses in the home buying policy is one step toward valuing nurses ... but it is only a very time step toward the necessary imperative to elevate the value and status of nurses .
until that is done , nurses will be in short supply and hospital infections , medical errors , and chronic disease will continue to cost lives and astounding amounts of money .

the rcn says the government 's scheme to help public sector workers get onto the property ladder has failed to help thousands in places like london .
the government says its initiative , the key worker living scheme , has a limited allocation of funds .
but the rcn says more money should be put into the scheme .
it also wants to see it extended outside the south east to other areas where workers currently get no help .
the key worker living scheme helps workers buy homes by offering them loans of up to £ 50,000 , or shared ownership schemes .
it is open to other public sector workers , such as police officers and teachers , but excludes nurses employed outside the nhs in private and charity sectors , as well as overseas nurses in the uk on work permits .
' over-stretched ' in its first year , the scheme helped 653 nurses in the south east .
so far this year , the scheme has received 25,000 applications , of which 5,197 are completed or are at an advanced stage .
but the government has revealed the scheme 's money is almost fully committed in some areas after just two months .
practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work laura jeffrey , neonatal staff nurse ' i ca n't afford my own home ' the rcn says nurses frustrated at not being able to afford to buy homes are having to find better paid jobs or take on extra work .
" we 've had examples where a senior nurse is talking about becoming a plumber because the wages are better and he can make sure that he has access to a home , " said rcn general secretary beverly malone .
" when you are 42 and you still ca n't buy a home , or even get close to buying one , then you are in great trouble . "
claire cannings , the rcn 's welfare officer , said the scheme was " fantastic " for those it helped , but added that it could seem " divisive and extremely unfair " for those who were not eligible .
existing property laura jeffrey , a 23-year-old neonatal staff nurse at leeds royal infirmary , is one of those not covered .
" it seems extremely unfair that i 'm excluded from the scheme because i am not nursing in the south , " she said .
" practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work . "
the government said the scheme was targeted at areas where it was hardest to recruit and retain staff .
it has also changed the scheme so key workers can apply to improve an existing property into a family home .
a spokesman for the office of the deputy prime minister , which oversees the scheme , said : " people may have problems buying a property , but if they are not in an area where there is a recruitment and retention issue , the scheme does not operate .
" staffing levels are monitored by the relevant departments , such as the department of health . "
should the government spend more on helping key workers buy homes ?
are you a trained nurse who has had to relocate , find a better paid job or take on extra work to get on the property ladder ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : i am a trained nurse , as is my wife .
we have had to fight tooth and nail to get a council house -lrb- indeed actually separating at one point -rrb- because we could not get any where near buying a house , even with the government scheme .
if we had not got this house , we would have moved -lrb- as we were on the verge of doing so anyway -rrb- to nottingham , as it was the only place we could afford to buy , and then only just .
i have just been promoted to senior staff nurse , meaning a lot of the time i am responsible for up to 28 patients care , as well as staff .
for this i get paid the grand sum of £ 19000 pa , when every day someone could die and its my responsibility .
i think rather than come up with gimmick schemes for housing in the worst areas , the government would be better served paying nurses to reflect the job they do .
graham , harlow , essex unaffordable housing is a bigger issue than simply for " key workers " .
i do n't think taxpayers money is best spent on schemes which are essentially marginal in nature .
phil lucas , derby it 's ridiculous that nurses who provide an essential service to the public are so undervalued that their wages do not allow them to buy homes .
the government should help them as much as they can .
stuart forsyth , hamilton , south lanarkshire i agree with beverly malone 's observation- but perhaps the problem is a structural one .
the inability of salaries to keep pace with house price inflation is more far-reaching than just the health sector , and affects many even in the north .
teachers , as well as other public sector workers are all similarly affected .
perhaps the problem would right itself with a house-price collapse-but how many would be worse-off then ?
only the government can help , but this frankly is unlikely .
there may be trouble ahead .
john flanagan , sunderland , uk there are a great many people in the uk who can not afford to buy a house .
why should the likes of nurses be given preferential treatment ?
as for the notion of " key workers " , surely the likes of bin men and bus drivers are key workers ?
should we subsidise them ?
how many workers in the uk are on minimum wages ?
nurses are not on minimum wages are they ?
also , how many nurses are married to the likes of policemen and firemen ?
put another way , we should spotlight family income as opposed to individual income .
john bowes , greenock i totally agree that more money should be made available not only to allow those in the nhs to buy homes but also help retain trained staff , what is the point of the nhs spending so much money on training only to lose it when staff leave for better paid jobs .
wages in the nhs are in need of a significant boost .
i am sure we all agree those that give their lives in the service of others should be rewarded .
raise tax .
tax the richest , lets have a better healthcare for all .
kingsley knights , guildford nurses get a generous bursary to study and get all their tuition fees paid .
they then start off on quite a competitive graduate salary of over £ 18,000 a year .
i think there 's a lot of graduates much worse off in low paid work with debts of thousands from student loans .
what nurses lack in immediate income they gain in job security .
alex , cambridge buying a house is not a right - on the continent there is n't the same pressure to be a home owner - the government should not be propping up the over-priced housing market in this way , but encouraging sensible renting and , probably , joint purchases .
this is a complete nonsense of a scheme .
robert steadman , matlock , united kingdom i 'm a nurse here in the states who has been seriously thinking of moving to england .
of course , i 'd seek work as a nurse , there , too .
this makes me stop and think since i 'm a single parent and the only income .
i would say that a nurse is a key worker since hospitals can hardly run without us .
i would not want to have to take a second job after working as hard as i do all day .
one does n't get all that training and obtain a license only to continue struggling to survive .
there would be no point in working as a nurse if that were the case , unless you were already independently wealthy .
christine conway , nyc , usa why should these so called ' key sector ' workers get assistance on buying a property ?
if they ca n't afford a property on their current salary , then they should find another job .
this amounts to discrimination against millions of private sector workers who are just as important .
paul turnbull , gateshead , tyne & wear if it had n't been for thatcher in the 80 's telling people that they should buy a house , there 'd be plenty of cheap , rented accommodation available still probably .
but no .
people from key sectors are moving into yet more insurance and banking jobs , leaving the really important areas to suffer .
i know a great deal of people would hate to hear this , but we need a property price crash .
its just getting silly .
david rickard , bucks no .
they should pay them more .
if they can not afford to pay them more then the numbers should reduce and the service should begin to fail , at that point the people will see they are not being paid enough and then accept that they have to pay more tax , or tax the rich more and then pay them more .
shaun maunder , ipswich why is so much attention given to key workers ?
what about the rest of us who are in similarly paid work , independent and still unable to get on to the property ladder ?
we are just as important .
caroline , maidenhead , uk nurses in cumbria are awaiting their historic victory for equal pay ... £ 27,000 for staff nurses. because this was a unison and not an rcn victory the rcn naturally are trying to sell their agenda for change pay structure which will leave most nurses worse off , that is someone who has studied for 3 years , has a job that requires clinical judgement be it dispensing medication to cardiac arrest , to simply feeding and cleaning the infirm , to documenting all the above , will still be paid less than a fireman , policeman or teacher or even an nhs electrician , plumber , carpenter etc sonya , north east i am a registered nurse in the us .
the same issue occurs here where nurses are unable to purchase homes and their standard of living -lrb- and relative wages -rrb- has declined over the last 20 years - while physician and health administrators incomes have soared .
the real issue is that not only do nurses have little power over their professional situation -lrb- work hours , salary , benefits -rrb- , they are undervalued by society at large .
it is important that society value nurses as much , if not more so , than physicians and managers .
nothing the physicians do will help if an adequate number of well educated nurses is not available for assisting patients to achieve optimal health and wellness .
no business model will work to assure the health of individuals and society if nurses are not included as an integral and important component for planning and implementing the model .
including nurses in the home buying policy is one step toward valuing nurses ... but it is only a very time step toward the necessary imperative to elevate the value and status of nurses .
until that is done , nurses will be in short supply and hospital infections , medical errors , and chronic disease will continue to cost lives and astounding amounts of money .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- nurses ' quitting to buy houses ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes sunday , 19 june , 2005 , 10:12 gmt 11:12 uk nurses ' quitting to buy houses ' nurses are being forced to quit the profession because they can not afford to buy homes , the royal college of nursing has warned .
the rcn says the government 's scheme to help public sector workers get onto the property ladder has failed to help thousands in places like london .
the government says its initiative , the key worker living scheme , has a limited allocation of funds .
but the rcn says more money should be put into the scheme .
it also wants to see it extended outside the south east to other areas where workers currently get no help .
the key worker living scheme helps workers buy homes by offering them loans of up to £ 50,000 , or shared ownership schemes .
it is open to other public sector workers , such as police officers and teachers , but excludes nurses employed outside the nhs in private and charity sectors , as well as overseas nurses in the uk on work permits .
' over-stretched ' in its first year , the scheme helped 653 nurses in the south east .
so far this year , the scheme has received 25,000 applications , of which 5,197 are completed or are at an advanced stage .
but the government has revealed the scheme 's money is almost fully committed in some areas after just two months . "
practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work " laura jeffrey , neonatal staff nurse ' i ca n't afford my own home ' the rcn says nurses frustrated at not being able to afford to buy homes are having to find better paid jobs or take on extra work .
" we 've had examples where a senior nurse is talking about becoming a plumber because the wages are better and he can make sure that he has access to a home , " said rcn general secretary beverly malone .
" when you are 42 and you still ca n't buy a home , or even get close to buying one , then you are in great trouble . "
claire cannings , the rcn 's welfare officer , said the scheme was " fantastic " for those it helped , but added that it could seem " divisive and extremely unfair " for those who were not eligible .
existing property laura jeffrey , a 23-year-old neonatal staff nurse at leeds royal infirmary , is one of those not covered .
" it seems extremely unfair that i 'm excluded from the scheme because i am not nursing in the south , " she said .
" practically all my wages go on housing and transport to work . "
the government said the scheme was targeted at areas where it was hardest to recruit and retain staff .
it has also changed the scheme so key workers can apply to improve an existing property into a family home .
a spokesman for the office of the deputy prime minister , which oversees the scheme , said : " people may have problems buying a property , but if they are not in an area where there is a recruitment and retention issue , the scheme does not operate .
" staffing levels are monitored by the relevant departments , such as the department of health . "
should the government spend more on helping key workers buy homes ?
are you a trained nurse who has had to relocate , find a better paid job or take on extra work to get on the property ladder ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : i am a trained nurse , as is my wife .
we have had to fight tooth and nail to get a council house -lrb- indeed actually separating at one point -rrb- because we could not get any where near buying a house , even with the government scheme .
if we had not got this house , we would have moved -lrb- as we were on the verge of doing so anyway -rrb- to nottingham , as it was the only place we could afford to buy , and then only just .
i have just been promoted to senior staff nurse , meaning a lot of the time i am responsible for up to 28 patients care , as well as staff .
for this i get paid the grand sum of £ 19000 pa , when every day someone could die and its my responsibility .
i think rather than come up with gimmick schemes for housing in the worst areas , the government would be better served paying nurses to reflect the job they do .
graham , harlow , essex unaffordable housing is a bigger issue than simply for " key workers " .
i do n't think taxpayers money is best spent on schemes which are essentially marginal in nature .
phil lucas , derby it 's ridiculous that nurses who provide an essential service to the public are so undervalued that their wages do not allow them to buy homes .
the government should help them as much as they can .
stuart forsyth , hamilton , south lanarkshire i agree with beverly malone 's observation- but perhaps the problem is a structural one .
the inability of salaries to keep pace with house price inflation is more far-reaching than just the health sector , and affects many even in the north .
teachers , as well as other public sector workers are all similarly affected .
perhaps the problem would right itself with a house-price collapse-but how many would be worse-off then ?
only the government can help , but this frankly is unlikely .
there may be trouble ahead .
john flanagan , sunderland , uk there are a great many people in the uk who can not afford to buy a house .
why should the likes of nurses be given preferential treatment ?
as for the notion of " key workers " , surely the likes of bin men and bus drivers are key workers ?
should we subsidise them ?
how many workers in the uk are on minimum wages ?
nurses are not on minimum wages are they ?
also , how many nurses are married to the likes of policemen and firemen ?
put another way , we should spotlight family income as opposed to individual income .
john bowes , greenock i totally agree that more money should be made available not only to allow those in the nhs to buy homes but also help retain trained staff , what is the point of the nhs spending so much money on training only to lose it when staff leave for better paid jobs .
wages in the nhs are in need of a significant boost .
i am sure we all agree those that give their lives in the service of others should be rewarded .
raise tax .
tax the richest , lets have a better healthcare for all .
kingsley knights , guildford nurses get a generous bursary to study and get all their tuition fees paid .
they then start off on quite a competitive graduate salary of over £ 18,000 a year .
i think there 's a lot of graduates much worse off in low paid work with debts of thousands from student loans .
what nurses lack in immediate income they gain in job security .
alex , cambridge buying a house is not a right - on the continent there is n't the same pressure to be a home owner - the government should not be propping up the over-priced housing market in this way , but encouraging sensible renting and , probably , joint purchases .
this is a complete nonsense of a scheme .
robert steadman , matlock , united kingdom i 'm a nurse here in the states who has been seriously thinking of moving to england .
of course , i 'd seek work as a nurse , there , too .
this makes me stop and think since i 'm a single parent and the only income .
i would say that a nurse is a key worker since hospitals can hardly run without us .
i would not want to have to take a second job after working as hard as i do all day .
one does n't get all that training and obtain a license only to continue struggling to survive .
there would be no point in working as a nurse if that were the case , unless you were already independently wealthy .
christine conway , nyc , usa why should these so called ' key sector ' workers get assistance on buying a property ?
if they ca n't afford a property on their current salary , then they should find another job .
this amounts to discrimination against millions of private sector workers who are just as important .
paul turnbull , gateshead , tyne & wear if it had n't been for thatcher in the 80 's telling people that they should buy a house , there 'd be plenty of cheap , rented accommodation available still probably .
but no .
people from key sectors are moving into yet more insurance and banking jobs , leaving the really important areas to suffer .
i know a great deal of people would hate to hear this , but we need a property price crash .
its just getting silly .
david rickard , bucks no .
they should pay them more .
if they can not afford to pay them more then the numbers should reduce and the service should begin to fail , at that point the people will see they are not being paid enough and then accept that they have to pay more tax , or tax the rich more and then pay them more .
shaun maunder , ipswich why is so much attention given to key workers ?
what about the rest of us who are in similarly paid work , independent and still unable to get on to the property ladder ?
we are just as important .
