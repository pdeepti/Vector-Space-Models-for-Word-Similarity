" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .

they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .

" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .

once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .

gustav humbert , the current number two at airbus , was tapped to take over from forgeard as chief executive of the toulouse-based aircraft maker , which is 80 percent held by eads and is the group 's main activity , the company said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2005 german banks grapple with change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uneasy about the future : frankfurt , germany 's financial capital the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .

thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .

in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .

ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran .

" " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2005 documenting a dying regime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving the trabi a boost - just one impression of life in the old gdr nostalgia for communist east germany is dying hard , with many forgetting the dark side of history now that retro is hip .
dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2005 german banks grapple with change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uneasy about the future : frankfurt , germany 's financial capital the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 12 , 2005 -rrb- european banks leave germany in the dust german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .
german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that .

" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

salvador carmona and aaron galindo were kicked out of the competition by mexico coach ricardo lavolpe on tuesday , with rumors abounding that the duo had tested positive for nandrolone .
franz beckenbauer , the chief of germany 's 2006 world cup committee , later claimed he was told by fifa president sepp blatter that drug taking had nothing to do with the scandal .
on friday , a fifa statement said that all subsequent doping tests had turned out to be negative : " in compliance with its doping control regulations , fifa has carried out doping tests on two players per team after each of the matches in the fifa confederations cup 2005 .
all 48 tests conducted after the first twelve matches , including those on six mexican players who were tested in germany , have proved negative .
it is understood that the mexican football association -lrb- fmf -rrb- conducted doping tests in mexico before the start of the fifa confederations cup .
according to the mexican football association 's initial report , which has yet to be completed , two players , aaron galindo and salvador carmona , tested positive .
the mexican association therefore ordered the two players to return home on wednesday , 22 june 2005 , citing disciplinary problems .
neither galindo nor carmona were among the six players drawn to undergo official doping tests at the fifa confederations cup in germany .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .

" the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers .

" " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 12 , 2005 -rrb- european banks leave germany in the dust german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .

we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .

but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .

salvador carmona and aaron galindo were kicked out of the competition by mexico coach ricardo lavolpe on tuesday , with rumors abounding that the duo had tested positive for nandrolone .
franz beckenbauer , the chief of germany 's 2006 world cup committee , later claimed he was told by fifa president sepp blatter that drug taking had nothing to do with the scandal .
on friday , a fifa statement said that all subsequent doping tests had turned out to be negative : " in compliance with its doping control regulations , fifa has carried out doping tests on two players per team after each of the matches in the fifa confederations cup 2005 .
all 48 tests conducted after the first twelve matches , including those on six mexican players who were tested in germany , have proved negative .
it is understood that the mexican football association -lrb- fmf -rrb- conducted doping tests in mexico before the start of the fifa confederations cup .
according to the mexican football association 's initial report , which has yet to be completed , two players , aaron galindo and salvador carmona , tested positive .
the mexican association therefore ordered the two players to return home on wednesday , 22 june 2005 , citing disciplinary problems .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2005 documenting a dying regime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving the trabi a boost - just one impression of life in the old gdr nostalgia for communist east germany is dying hard , with many forgetting the dark side of history now that retro is hip .
dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2005 german banks grapple with change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uneasy about the future : frankfurt , germany 's financial capital the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 12 , 2005 -rrb- european banks leave germany in the dust german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .

there are several reasons for that .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday . the game between the group a runners-up and group b winners is being held in the shadow of the scandal involving mexican players salvador carmona and aaron galindo , who were sent home on tuesday in disgrace on suspicion of having taken the banned steroid nandrolone . while that is hardly the best way for ricardo lavolpe 's team to prepare for argentina on the plus side is the return of the talismanic barcelona defender rafael marquez , who had to sit out mexico 's wins against tuinisia and brazil due to a leg injury , but was used as a substitute in their goalless draw against greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panagiotis fyssas of greece , center , is challenged by mexico 's luis perez , left , and juan rodriguez during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and mexico in frankfurt , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- " i 'm proud of what my teammates have accomplished so far .
it 's a young side that 's done well to adapt to the tactics adopted by the manager , " said marquez .
" argentina are one of the best sides in the world but we 're ready .
it 's been a long time since we lost , which proves our team can go far . " unbeated streak in fact lavolpe 's men are seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to 22 matches - and defeating the world champions brazil will have done their confidence no end of good ahead of this stern test . argentina striker javier saviola spelled out the dangers presented by mexico .
" we 've got to be careful , " warned the monaco star .
" mexico have proved tough opposition for us in the past .
their style of play is very different to ours .
they 're fast and well organized , we 've got to be calm . " he said his side had improved as the competition had progressed , and the match would act as a benchmark to see where argentina stood one year from the world cup , which many are tipping the south americans as the favorite to win .
though they are strong , they are not invincible .
at the confed cup , argentina have excelled in attack , but also have suffered from a leaky defense , with five goals slipping past keeper german lux . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi , right , scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot as argentinas 's goalkeeper german lux , left , fails to save during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , saturday , june 18 , 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2005 iran election spells trouble for nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad roundly defeated his moderate challenger rafsanjani iran 's dramatic shift to the right with the electoral victory of ultra-conservative tehran mayor mahmoud ahmadinejad spells trouble for already tense nuclear negotiations with the eu and us governments . with ahmadinejad as its new president , the islamic regime is now expected to take a far more aggressive stance over its ambition to possess sensitive enrichment technology , analysts and diplomats said on saturday . while ahmadinejad 's victory has come as a shock , equally damaging to the prospects of the kind of deal britain , france and germany are seeking is the humiliating defeat and uncertain future for moderate cleric akbar hashemi rafsanjani . " i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .
the timing of this is entirely up to the iranians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2005 german banks grapple with change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uneasy about the future : frankfurt , germany 's financial capital the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 12 , 2005 -rrb- european banks leave germany in the dust german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .
german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that .
-lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .

sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .

foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .

ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .
it meant germany had gone behind three times in the match and there was no coming back again as brazil held on . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2005 german banks grapple with change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uneasy about the future : frankfurt , germany 's financial capital the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition . " christof polzer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran . " bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , britain and germany have been involved in long-standing talks with iranian officials aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program " uncertain phase " european officials said the future direction of the talks was now uncertain , echoing french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy 's comment last week that rafsanjani " has had a slightly more liberal attitude . " " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase . " our position remains the same : no enrichment , " said a european diplomat .
" otherwise this issue goes to the un security council .

experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape . the planned merger of italy 's unicredito with hypovereinsbank , germany 's second-largest bank , created a stir in banking circles in germany . josef ackermann , head of deutsche bank , stressed recently on german public television that a takeover of the german banking star was out of the question .
instead , germany needs at least one strong bank with global success , ackermann said , adding that it be might worth while for deutsche bank to aim for a takeover itself . there 's little doubt that speculation is growing after the hvb-unicredito merger , fuelled by the fact that the german banking sector will face dramatic changes starting mid july this year . according to a european commission banking decree that will take effect next month , state guarantees for public banks that allow them to enjoy relatively inexpensive borrowing costs and generally give their bonds aaa ratings , will be abolished .
brussels maintains that the state guarantees violate the eu 's fair-competition regulations .
thus , federal states and municipalities in germany will in future no longer be obliged to act as guarantors for public banks in the event of default . landesbanken face unsure future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the decree affect germany 's sparkassen ?
professor thomas hartmann-wendels , a banking expert at the university of cologne , said that while the change will hardly dent savings banks or sparkassen and landesbanken , which fall into the second tier of the savings bank group , will be badly hit by the decree . " the abolition of state guarantees certainly makes sense because there was an element of distorted competition in some areas , " hartmann-wendels said .
" it will hardly have any consequences for the normal savings banks but it definitely will for the landesbanken , which do n't have a retail branching system and do n't refinance themselves through savings or deposits of the customers but rather through a high degree of foreign capital from international capital markets . " " they -lrb- the landesbanken -rrb- will have to pay significantly more to borrow money because this first-class credit rating that they had thanks to the state guarantees will no longer be valid in the future , " he added , but rejected the idea that the separation of individual sectors in the german banking landscape was no longer in synch with the era of globalization . " i think that even in the globalization era there is a need for local presence and local knowledge of things at hand , " he said .
" and that can be especially well represented through the savings banks and cooperative banks that are anchored in regional areas .
this local presence definitely has its own value and makes sense even today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord lb 's headquarters in hanover there are fears too that without the protective cover of state guarantees , landesbanken may flounder and be forced to seek merger partners .
this week the hanover-based nord lb landesbank is reported to be creating a joint banking venture with norway 's dnb nor asa with a baltic sea focus . german banks not attractive to foreign ones however , the banking expert sees no danger of a repeat of hvb 's recent takeover in the german banking landscape despite mounting concerns about mergers and sales . " i do n't see german banks endangered by takeovers , " he said .
" hvb was a special case - it had big problems and was squeezed into a corner .
besides , the business models of both the banks -lrb- hvb and unicredito -rrb- complemented each other . " but i do n't see that danger with other banks .
the german banking market is not at all attractive for foreign banks because there are relatively slim margins here due to tough competition .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .

in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .

ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .

salvador carmona and aaron galindo were kicked out of the competition by mexico coach ricardo lavolpe on tuesday , with rumors abounding that the duo had tested positive for nandrolone .
franz beckenbauer , the chief of germany 's 2006 world cup committee , later claimed he was told by fifa president sepp blatter that drug taking had nothing to do with the scandal .
on friday , a fifa statement said that all subsequent doping tests had turned out to be negative : " in compliance with its doping control regulations , fifa has carried out doping tests on two players per team after each of the matches in the fifa confederations cup 2005 .
all 48 tests conducted after the first twelve matches , including those on six mexican players who were tested in germany , have proved negative .
it is understood that the mexican football association -lrb- fmf -rrb- conducted doping tests in mexico before the start of the fifa confederations cup .
according to the mexican football association 's initial report , which has yet to be completed , two players , aaron galindo and salvador carmona , tested positive .
the mexican association therefore ordered the two players to return home on wednesday , 22 june 2005 , citing disciplinary problems .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers . " " a popular and fundamentalist government will quickly change that , " he said last week , boasting that " no country , no matter how powerful they are , can attack iran .

" " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .
and if they do not accept our conditions , its simple - we wo n't buy anything from them , " he said in a campaign broadcast . the next round of talks are scheduled for late july , when the europeans are obliged to put forward a proposal for a deal but certain not to satisfy iran 's demands to resume enrichment . diplomats believe iran 's new regime will take time to " settle in " , and when it has they say the crisis is likely to reach a new , more serious phase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2005 documenting a dying regime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving the trabi a boost - just one impression of life in the old gdr nostalgia for communist east germany is dying hard , with many forgetting the dark side of history now that retro is hip .
dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .

for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : peter kneffel dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + apparently emerson stepped on ballack 's foot and he went down somewhat theatrically .
ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2005 documenting a dying regime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving the trabi a boost - just one impression of life in the old gdr nostalgia for communist east germany is dying hard , with many forgetting the dark side of history now that retro is hip .
dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2005 documenting a dying regime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving the trabi a boost - just one impression of life in the old gdr nostalgia for communist east germany is dying hard , with many forgetting the dark side of history now that retro is hip .
dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : peter kneffel dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + apparently emerson stepped on ballack 's foot and he went down somewhat theatrically .
ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .
it meant germany had gone behind three times in the match and there was no coming back again as brazil held on . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : peter kneffel dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + apparently emerson stepped on ballack 's foot and he went down somewhat theatrically .
ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .
it meant germany had gone behind three times in the match and there was no coming back again as brazil held on . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : peter kneffel dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + apparently emerson stepped on ballack 's foot and he went down somewhat theatrically .
ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .

salvador carmona and aaron galindo were kicked out of the competition by mexico coach ricardo lavolpe on tuesday , with rumors abounding that the duo had tested positive for nandrolone .
franz beckenbauer , the chief of germany 's 2006 world cup committee , later claimed he was told by fifa president sepp blatter that drug taking had nothing to do with the scandal .
on friday , a fifa statement said that all subsequent doping tests had turned out to be negative : " in compliance with its doping control regulations , fifa has carried out doping tests on two players per team after each of the matches in the fifa confederations cup 2005 .
all 48 tests conducted after the first twelve matches , including those on six mexican players who were tested in germany , have proved negative .
it is understood that the mexican football association -lrb- fmf -rrb- conducted doping tests in mexico before the start of the fifa confederations cup .
according to the mexican football association 's initial report , which has yet to be completed , two players , aaron galindo and salvador carmona , tested positive .
the mexican association therefore ordered the two players to return home on wednesday , 22 june 2005 , citing disciplinary problems .
neither galindo nor carmona were among the six players drawn to undergo official doping tests at the fifa confederations cup in germany .

dispelling the myth is a new version of a book that takes a frank look at the gdr 's final years . the book " east berlin : life before the wall fell " by photographer harald hauswald and writer lutz rathenow was first published in west germany in 1987 under the title " east berlin : the other side of city . " it soon made its way back across the border , where east german officials were not amused by the photos of punks , rotting courtyards serving as playgrounds for east german kids , and long lines in front of butchers ' shops featured in its pages .
that certainly was not the image that east germany was trying to sell to the outside world , especially at a time when authorities in both east and west berlin were organizing ceremonies to mark the city 's 750th anniversary . bildunterschrift : the fountain on berlin 's central alexanderplatz still exists but is now a favorite gathering place for the city 's teenage punks east german officials designated the book 's publication as an " unfriendly act " and issued a ban .
ironically , the furore surrounding the book was never the authors ' intention . " we simply wanted to show life as it was , and that did n't happen in the official press , " hauswald said .
" we wanted to show our view of things , and we were aware that it was different .
but we were n't saying , ' we 'll finish you off . '
we did n't really have a hidden motive , we just wanted to present things in an honest way . " informants and failed ideals the pair turned an empty apartment into their office , and from there , went out to really look at east berlin .
hauswald knew every corner , courtyard and bar .
the resulting photographs captured a special view of people and situations .
rathenow 's accompanying text told tales of informants , gay barmen and failed ideals .
for the censors in the former east germany , it was explosive material . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cover of the book 's new edition for that reason , the book could not be published in east germany .
but the pair had some west german journalist friends who smuggled the manuscripts into the west , disguised as their own material .
once the book appeared , the authorities moved to prosecute the authors for tax and currency offences . " thanks to our many contacts and constant publicity in the west , we had a degree of protection , and we used that to our advantage , " rathenow said .
" that probably made some people furious , because we acted as though it was completely normal to do what we wanted .
that was so subversive - not attacking the state , but simply behaving as though there was no censorship mechanism . " luxury limousines driving past communist slogans such as " long live marxism " , a frustrated member of the state youth organization - many of the photographs cast a satirical light on daily life under communism .
the wonderfully laconic images gained a cult following . bildunterschrift : " long live marxism-leninism , " reads the sign behind the stretch limousines carrying high-ranking communist officials . now , almost 20 years later , the book is back , though slightly changed .
today , the images document an important period in contemporary history . " most of the photos could n't be taken today , it really is a history of a vanished country , " hauswald said .
" the images had a different significance back then .
now , the country -lrb- that was east germany -rrb- is disappearing , both visually and also partly from people 's minds .

" i think rafsanjani wanted a deal .
up to now he has been allowed to handle the issue , and i believe he truly wanted to go down in history as the man who solved the problem with the united states , " a western diplomat told afp . " he was using the nuclear issue as a bargaining chip .
it would have taken a long time , but i think the chance was there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani but in the wake of such a stunning loss at the polls , rafsanjani 's ability to employ a moderating influence within the regime hierarchy - and particularly with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei - looks in doubt . " the right-wing now have total control .
they are not necessarily the kind of people who want a deal , " said the senior diplomat , speaking on condition that he not be named . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with the eu-3 , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . rafsanjani , an ex-president and savvy deal-maker , has stuck by iran 's suspension and by the talks - as has his key loyalist and top negotiator hassan rowhani . the president is only iran 's number-two on paper , and often lower than that in practice .
but ahmadinejad would bolster the ranks of right-wingers who argue that iran has a " legitimate right " to press on with nuclear work and , more importantly , should do so regardless of the consequences . ahmadinejad has complained that " those who are handling the talks are terrified , and before they even sit down at the negotiating table they retreat 500 kilometers .

" " rafsanjani 's defeat moves us into a very uncertain phase , " said a european diplomat close to the talks . " the talks were reaching something of a head anyway , but rafsanjani was a known quantity .
we were confident iran was willing to make a deal if the price was right .
i 'm feeling a little pessimistic now , " said the source . indeed , for ahmadinejad , it should be iran that calls the shots in the talks . " we spend 30 billion dollars on imports , and this is an immense means of pressure in negotiations .
it is we who should impose our conditions on them and not they on us .

it was the third time brazil have reached the final and they will hope to repeat their win from 1997 in the frankfurt final in four days time .
argentina or mexico will be their opponents with the two facing off on sunday in the other semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany it was a disappointing end to the tournament but manager jürgen klinsmann could be proud of their progress with this only their second defeat in his 12 months in charge .
the hosts now have a consolation third-place play-off in leipzig against the runner-up from the other semi-final . with the match just seven minutes old , an overenthusiastic male fan ran on to the pitch waving a black and white flag and tried to hand it over to the surprised brazilian midfielder emerson .
a host of stewards escorted the youth off the pitch but football 's governing body fifa , will be concerned as this is not the first pitch invasion in this tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano scores the 1-0 lead with a free-kick during the semi-final of the confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : oliver weiken dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + both sides looked dangerous from set-pieces and it was the source of the first goal .
in the 21st minute adriano let rip with a ferocious 35 meter free-kick with his trusty left foot and with a slight deflection off the wall german goalkeeper jens lehmann was left with no chance . it was the 250th goal in the confederations cup and the 251st came just 60 seconds later .
sebastian deisler swung in a corner and podolski headed past dida with the brazil backline all at sea . just before the interval both teams ploughed forward and a hectic period saw two controversial penalties awarded . robert huth tussled with adriano and the referee strangely pointed to the penalty spot with ronaldinho converting with aplomb in the 43rd minute .
seconds before the interval germany were awarded another controversial spot-kick with no obvious foul in the area other than huth tugging at roque junior 's shirt . bildunterschrift : brazilian captain ronaldinho -lrb- r -rrb- celebrates after scoring the 2-1 lead against german goalie jens lehmann with a penalty during the semi-final of confederations cup tournament germany vs brazil in nuremberg , germany , june 25 , 2005 .
foto : peter kneffel dpa -lrb- eds : internet use and mobile applications subject to fifa 's terms and conditions -rrb- + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + apparently emerson stepped on ballack 's foot and he went down somewhat theatrically .
ballack did not care about the controversial nature of the call and smashed his penalty past dida for his third goal of the tournament - remarkably all of them spot-kicks . chilean referee carlos chandia and his assistants were having a game to forget and enraged both sets of players in the second half with peculiar decisions . in the 58th minute , kuranyi , born in rio but a nationalized german , had a great chance when released but a poor first touch let him down . yet brazil looked dangerous on the counter attack and in the 76th minute adriano raced through and got the better of huth , before hammering a left footed shot past lehmann .
it meant germany had gone behind three times in the match and there was no coming back again as brazil held on . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

figures suggest 60 % of all household waste could be recycled or composted , but the largest nation in the uk , england , appears to be reusing only 17.7 % .
here bbc correspondents provide a snapshot of how the uk 's european neighbours and other countries approach recycling of everyday rubbish .
switzerland : imogen foulkes switzerland is proud of its recycling efforts , and with good reason .
glass and paper are just some of the things the average swiss refuses to simply throw away .
there are bottle banks at every supermarket , with separate slots for clear , green and brown glass .
every town has a free paper collection once a month , and that does not mean just old newspapers ; most people recycle everything made of cardboard or paper , from cereal packets to old telephone bills .
then there is green waste .
if you have a garden , all the trimmings can be put out on the street -lrb- neatly bundled of course -rrb- every two weeks , and they will be collected .
aluminium and tin can be taken to local depots , batteries handed over at the supermarket , and old oil or other chemicals deposited at special sites .
plastic pet bottles are the most common drinks containers in switzerland , and 80 % of them are recycled - far higher than the european average of 20 to 40 % .
but the swiss do not recycle just because they care about the environment .
there is a strong financial incentive .
recycling is free , but in most parts of switzerland throwing away rubbish costs money - each rubbish bag has to have a sticker on it , and each sticker costs at least one euro -lrb- 60 pence -rrb- .
so the less you throw out , the less you pay .
no sticker ?
then the rubbish will be left outside your house to rot .
united states : matthew davis efforts to improve recycling rates and to reduce household and commercial waste are led by the us environmental protection agency -lrb- epa -rrb- .
today , the us recycles about 28 % of its waste , the epa says , a rate that has almost doubled during the past 15 years .
recycling of specific materials has grown even more drastically : 42 % of all paper , 40 % of all plastic soft drink bottles , 55 % of all aluminium beer and soft drink cans , 57 % of all steel packaging , and 52 % of all major appliances are now recycled .
twenty years ago , only one roadside recycling programme existed in the us .
by 1998 there were 9,000 roadside programmes and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centres across the nation .
some 480 materials recovery plants have been established to process the collected materials .
in 1999 , recycling and composting activities prevented about 64 million tons of material from ending up in landfills and incinerators .
the epa 's wastewise scheme is aimed at businesses and other organisations and targets the reduction of municipal solid waste and certain industrial wastes .
recycling rates vary from state to state .
at the bottom end of the scale alaska , wyoming and montana recycle less than 9 % of waste , while in new york , virginia and five other states more than 40 % of waste is recycled .
denmark : thomas buch-andersen waste is not just waste .
that is the underlying philosophy of one of europe 's " greenest " countries .
for decades , the danish environment policy has been to regard waste as a resource .
tough standards have been set by consecutive governments , but it is up to the local authorities to collect whatever waste households may produce .
in 2003 that averaged 559 kg of waste per dane , ranging from plastic and paper to bottles and batteries .
in those councils where not all types of waste are collected at the house , nearby disposal sites or citizen helplines are in place .
nearly 10,000 danes are in the business of collecting waste - more than 0.1 % of the entire population .
the hard push towards a greener denmark has given he country a proud record .
government figures for 2003 suggest that 31 % of all household waste was recycled , while 62 % was incinerated .
the remaining 6 % was landfill waste .
however , often the total amount of waste is not big enough for denmark to have its own recycling plants .
in particular , plastic waste , waste from electrical and electronic products , and batteries and metal are sent abroad for recycling .
the government also aims to limit the waste mountain by encouraging industry to promote products that leave a minimum of waste after use .
germany : tristana moore the germans like to think of themselves as the world champions of the environment .
there is no denying the fact that germans take green issues seriously .
when it comes to separating your household rubbish , this can be a complicated business .
as a foreigner living in berlin , you can easily be embarrassed by your german friends who will berate you for not separating your rubbish .
there are at least five types of rubbish bin in the courtyards of apartment buildings and inside people 's houses .
luckily , the bins are colour-coded , to avoid any confusion - a yellow bin for packaging -lrb- old milk cartons etc -rrb- , a blue bin for paper and cardboard , bins for glass -lrb- separated into ones for clear , brown and green glass -rrb- a " bio " bin designed for left-over food and plant waste .
finally , there is a black bin for the rest of the rubbish -lrb- or for those people who do not bother to sort out their rubbish -rrb- .
in theory , people are obliged under german law to take any " special rubbish , " such as batteries or chemicals , to a recycling centre .
if you fail to do this , it could be considered an " administrative offence " , although in practice prosecutions are rare .
the separation of rubbish is not compulsory for the private citizen , but according to surveys , around 90 % of germans are willing to sort out their rubbish .
where all this rubbish finally ends up is also complicated .
according to a new law which came into force on the first of june 2005 , the left-over rubbish must not simply be consigned to a rubbish dump , but it must be subjected to a pre-treatment process .
greece : richard galpin in the cramped offices of the ecological recycling society in central athens , philip kirkitsos hits me with some alarming statistics .
every year , he says , one billion plastic drinking water bottles are thrown away in greece , along with one billion soft drinks bottles and yet another billion plastic containers for cleaning fluids .
almost one-fifth of the entire waste produced by this country is plastic , and yet just 1 % of it is recycled .
greece , he admits , is at least 15 years behind the rest of the eu in almost all areas of recycling and is unlikely to meet eu targets for next year .
in athens the recycling bins so common in most european cities are a rare sight .
although recently the authorities have launched new schemes , the impact so far seems to be minimal .
recycling just is not high on the list of priorities for the average athenian .
most bags of household waste contain large amounts of glass , metal , paper and plastic which end up being dumped at the city 's only landfill which - not surprisingly - is now almost full .
as a result , the capital currently faces an acute waste management crisis because no alternative sites have been set up .
ironically the city does have what is believed to be europe 's largest recycling plant , built next to the landfill four years ago .
but the plant - estimated to have cost at least 75m euros -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- - has stood idle .
the reason ?
it was badly damaged by a mountain of rubbish which collapsed on top of it .
italy : jeremy bowen waste disposal regulations in italy vary from district to district .
in rome , the rules were toughened earlier this month .
people who do not separate their rubbish can be fined up to 619 euros if they have a recycling bin within 500 metres of their front door .
romans often claim that it is hard to find a bin and even harder to find one that is not full .
the city council has ordered 2,500 new bins .
they are colour-coded green for household waste , white for paper and blue for plastic .
the streets of the historic centre of rome have almost no recycling bins yet .
the streets are cleaned very efficiently , by vehicles that drive over waste and suck it up like enormous self-propelled vacuum cleaners .
in southern italy local politicians claim that the waste management industry is controlled by organised crime .
last year the european commission said it was taking action against italy , for 28 breaches of eu laws on the environment .
it said that italy was denying its citizens the same quality of life enjoyed by people in other eu countries .
when i moved here five months ago i asked the caretaker of my building whether i should separate my family 's rubbish .
he laughed and looked incredulous .
" are you joking ? " he said .
" this is rome . "
senegal hamadou tidiane sy recycling is not done on an industrial scale , but it is part of daily life for many resourceful senegalese .
everything is recycled , from plastic bags to school exercise books , food cans , bottles of mineral water and even fruit peel .
the peel is said to be collected for use in cheap perfume .
tomato tins become drinking cups in rural areas or are used by beggars in the streets , old newspapers and administrative documents are used to wrap bread , fruit or peanuts you buy in the street .
some artisans also use metal waste to produce anything from chairs to kitchen utensils and children 's toys .
plastic bags are used to make shoes .
in the old days , worn tyres used to be made into sandals , but these are much less popular now .
recently , some smart people have started collecting all the metal waste they can find to send it back to factories in europe .
the swiss waste disposal firm alcyon has signed a contract with the government worth more than $ 9m to collect and treat rubbish in the capital dakar .
the project is being managed by ama-senegal , which will remove a huge tip called mbeubeuss and recycle much of the city 's waste .

aluminium and tin can be taken to local depots , batteries handed over at the supermarket , and old oil or other chemicals deposited at special sites .
plastic pet bottles are the most common drinks containers in switzerland , and 80 % of them are recycled - far higher than the european average of 20 to 40 % .
but the swiss do not recycle just because they care about the environment .
there is a strong financial incentive .
recycling is free , but in most parts of switzerland throwing away rubbish costs money - each rubbish bag has to have a sticker on it , and each sticker costs at least one euro -lrb- 60 pence -rrb- .
so the less you throw out , the less you pay .
no sticker ?
then the rubbish will be left outside your house to rot .
united states : matthew davis efforts to improve recycling rates and to reduce household and commercial waste are led by the us environmental protection agency -lrb- epa -rrb- .
today , the us recycles about 28 % of its waste , the epa says , a rate that has almost doubled during the past 15 years .
recycling of specific materials has grown even more drastically : 42 % of all paper , 40 % of all plastic soft drink bottles , 55 % of all aluminium beer and soft drink cans , 57 % of all steel packaging , and 52 % of all major appliances are now recycled .
twenty years ago , only one roadside recycling programme existed in the us .
by 1998 there were 9,000 roadside programmes and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centres across the nation .
some 480 materials recovery plants have been established to process the collected materials .
in 1999 , recycling and composting activities prevented about 64 million tons of material from ending up in landfills and incinerators .
the epa 's wastewise scheme is aimed at businesses and other organisations and targets the reduction of municipal solid waste and certain industrial wastes .
recycling rates vary from state to state .
at the bottom end of the scale alaska , wyoming and montana recycle less than 9 % of waste , while in new york , virginia and five other states more than 40 % of waste is recycled .
denmark : thomas buch-andersen waste is not just waste .
that is the underlying philosophy of one of europe 's " greenest " countries .
for decades , the danish environment policy has been to regard waste as a resource .
tough standards have been set by consecutive governments , but it is up to the local authorities to collect whatever waste households may produce .
in 2003 that averaged 559 kg of waste per dane , ranging from plastic and paper to bottles and batteries .
in those councils where not all types of waste are collected at the house , nearby disposal sites or citizen helplines are in place .
nearly 10,000 danes are in the business of collecting waste - more than 0.1 % of the entire population .
the hard push towards a greener denmark has given he country a proud record .
government figures for 2003 suggest that 31 % of all household waste was recycled , while 62 % was incinerated .
the remaining 6 % was landfill waste .
however , often the total amount of waste is not big enough for denmark to have its own recycling plants .
in particular , plastic waste , waste from electrical and electronic products , and batteries and metal are sent abroad for recycling .
the government also aims to limit the waste mountain by encouraging industry to promote products that leave a minimum of waste after use .
germany : tristana moore the germans like to think of themselves as the world champions of the environment .
there is no denying the fact that germans take green issues seriously .
when it comes to separating your household rubbish , this can be a complicated business .
as a foreigner living in berlin , you can easily be embarrassed by your german friends who will berate you for not separating your rubbish .
there are at least five types of rubbish bin in the courtyards of apartment buildings and inside people 's houses .
luckily , the bins are colour-coded , to avoid any confusion - a yellow bin for packaging -lrb- old milk cartons etc -rrb- , a blue bin for paper and cardboard , bins for glass -lrb- separated into ones for clear , brown and green glass -rrb- a " bio " bin designed for left-over food and plant waste .
finally , there is a black bin for the rest of the rubbish -lrb- or for those people who do not bother to sort out their rubbish -rrb- .
in theory , people are obliged under german law to take any " special rubbish , " such as batteries or chemicals , to a recycling centre .
if you fail to do this , it could be considered an " administrative offence " , although in practice prosecutions are rare .
the separation of rubbish is not compulsory for the private citizen , but according to surveys , around 90 % of germans are willing to sort out their rubbish .
where all this rubbish finally ends up is also complicated .
according to a new law which came into force on the first of june 2005 , the left-over rubbish must not simply be consigned to a rubbish dump , but it must be subjected to a pre-treatment process .
greece : richard galpin in the cramped offices of the ecological recycling society in central athens , philip kirkitsos hits me with some alarming statistics .
every year , he says , one billion plastic drinking water bottles are thrown away in greece , along with one billion soft drinks bottles and yet another billion plastic containers for cleaning fluids .
almost one-fifth of the entire waste produced by this country is plastic , and yet just 1 % of it is recycled .
greece , he admits , is at least 15 years behind the rest of the eu in almost all areas of recycling and is unlikely to meet eu targets for next year .
in athens the recycling bins so common in most european cities are a rare sight .
although recently the authorities have launched new schemes , the impact so far seems to be minimal .
recycling just is not high on the list of priorities for the average athenian .
most bags of household waste contain large amounts of glass , metal , paper and plastic which end up being dumped at the city 's only landfill which - not surprisingly - is now almost full .
as a result , the capital currently faces an acute waste management crisis because no alternative sites have been set up .
ironically the city does have what is believed to be europe 's largest recycling plant , built next to the landfill four years ago .
but the plant - estimated to have cost at least 75m euros -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- - has stood idle .
the reason ?
it was badly damaged by a mountain of rubbish which collapsed on top of it .
italy : jeremy bowen waste disposal regulations in italy vary from district to district .
in rome , the rules were toughened earlier this month .
people who do not separate their rubbish can be fined up to 619 euros if they have a recycling bin within 500 metres of their front door .
romans often claim that it is hard to find a bin and even harder to find one that is not full .
the city council has ordered 2,500 new bins .
they are colour-coded green for household waste , white for paper and blue for plastic .
the streets of the historic centre of rome have almost no recycling bins yet .
the streets are cleaned very efficiently , by vehicles that drive over waste and suck it up like enormous self-propelled vacuum cleaners .
in southern italy local politicians claim that the waste management industry is controlled by organised crime .
last year the european commission said it was taking action against italy , for 28 breaches of eu laws on the environment .
it said that italy was denying its citizens the same quality of life enjoyed by people in other eu countries .
when i moved here five months ago i asked the caretaker of my building whether i should separate my family 's rubbish .
he laughed and looked incredulous .
" are you joking ? " he said .
" this is rome . "
senegal hamadou tidiane sy recycling is not done on an industrial scale , but it is part of daily life for many resourceful senegalese .
everything is recycled , from plastic bags to school exercise books , food cans , bottles of mineral water and even fruit peel .
the peel is said to be collected for use in cheap perfume .
tomato tins become drinking cups in rural areas or are used by beggars in the streets , old newspapers and administrative documents are used to wrap bread , fruit or peanuts you buy in the street .
some artisans also use metal waste to produce anything from chairs to kitchen utensils and children 's toys .
plastic bags are used to make shoes .
in the old days , worn tyres used to be made into sandals , but these are much less popular now .
recently , some smart people have started collecting all the metal waste they can find to send it back to factories in europe .
the swiss waste disposal firm alcyon has signed a contract with the government worth more than $ 9m to collect and treat rubbish in the capital dakar .
the project is being managed by ama-senegal , which will remove a huge tip called mbeubeuss and recycle much of the city 's waste .

figures suggest 60 % of all household waste could be recycled or composted , but the largest nation in the uk , england , appears to be reusing only 17.7 % .
here bbc correspondents provide a snapshot of how the uk 's european neighbours and other countries approach recycling of everyday rubbish .
click here for graph of waste management in eu switzerland : imogen foulkes switzerland is proud of its recycling efforts , and with good reason .
glass and paper are just some of the things the average swiss refuses to simply throw away .
there are bottle banks at every supermarket , with separate slots for clear , green and brown glass .
every town has a free paper collection once a month , and that does not mean just old newspapers ; most people recycle everything made of cardboard or paper , from cereal packets to old telephone bills .
then there is green waste .
if you have a garden , all the trimmings can be put out on the street -lrb- neatly bundled of course -rrb- every two weeks , and they will be collected .
aluminium and tin can be taken to local depots , batteries handed over at the supermarket , and old oil or other chemicals deposited at special sites .
plastic pet bottles are the most common drinks containers in switzerland , and 80 % of them are recycled - far higher than the european average of 20 to 40 % .
but the swiss do not recycle just because they care about the environment .
there is a strong financial incentive .
recycling is free , but in most parts of switzerland throwing away rubbish costs money - each rubbish bag has to have a sticker on it , and each sticker costs at least one euro -lrb- 60 pence -rrb- .
so the less you throw out , the less you pay .
no sticker ?
then the rubbish will be left outside your house to rot .
united states : matthew davis efforts to improve recycling rates and to reduce household and commercial waste are led by the us environmental protection agency -lrb- epa -rrb- .
today , the us recycles about 28 % of its waste , the epa says , a rate that has almost doubled during the past 15 years .
recycling of specific materials has grown even more drastically : 42 % of all paper , 40 % of all plastic soft drink bottles , 55 % of all aluminium beer and soft drink cans , 57 % of all steel packaging , and 52 % of all major appliances are now recycled .
twenty years ago , only one roadside recycling programme existed in the us .
by 1998 there were 9,000 roadside programmes and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centres across the nation .
some 480 materials recovery plants have been established to process the collected materials .
in 1999 , recycling and composting activities prevented about 64 million tons of material from ending up in landfills and incinerators .
the epa 's wastewise scheme is aimed at businesses and other organisations and targets the reduction of municipal solid waste and certain industrial wastes .
recycling rates vary from state to state .
at the bottom end of the scale alaska , wyoming and montana recycle less than 9 % of waste , while in new york , virginia and five other states more than 40 % of waste is recycled .
denmark : thomas buch-andersen waste is not just waste .
that is the underlying philosophy of one of europe 's " greenest " countries .
for decades , the danish environment policy has been to regard waste as a resource .
tough standards have been set by consecutive governments , but it is up to the local authorities to collect whatever waste households may produce .
in 2003 that averaged 559 kg of waste per dane , ranging from plastic and paper to bottles and batteries .
in those councils where not all types of waste are collected at the house , nearby disposal sites or citizen helplines are in place .
nearly 10,000 danes are in the business of collecting waste - more than 0.1 % of the entire population .
the hard push towards a greener denmark has given he country a proud record .
government figures for 2003 suggest that 31 % of all household waste was recycled , while 62 % was incinerated .
the remaining 6 % was landfill waste .
however , often the total amount of waste is not big enough for denmark to have its own recycling plants .
in particular , plastic waste , waste from electrical and electronic products , and batteries and metal are sent abroad for recycling .
the government also aims to limit the waste mountain by encouraging industry to promote products that leave a minimum of waste after use .
germany : tristana moore the germans like to think of themselves as the world champions of the environment .
there is no denying the fact that germans take green issues seriously .
when it comes to separating your household rubbish , this can be a complicated business .
as a foreigner living in berlin , you can easily be embarrassed by your german friends who will berate you for not separating your rubbish .
there are at least five types of rubbish bin in the courtyards of apartment buildings and inside people 's houses .
luckily , the bins are colour-coded , to avoid any confusion - a yellow bin for packaging -lrb- old milk cartons etc -rrb- , a blue bin for paper and cardboard , bins for glass -lrb- separated into ones for clear , brown and green glass -rrb- a " bio " bin designed for left-over food and plant waste .
finally , there is a black bin for the rest of the rubbish -lrb- or for those people who do not bother to sort out their rubbish -rrb- .
in theory , people are obliged under german law to take any " special rubbish , " such as batteries or chemicals , to a recycling centre .
if you fail to do this , it could be considered an " administrative offence " , although in practice prosecutions are rare .
the separation of rubbish is not compulsory for the private citizen , but according to surveys , around 90 % of germans are willing to sort out their rubbish .
where all this rubbish finally ends up is also complicated .
according to a new law which came into force on the first of june 2005 , the left-over rubbish must not simply be consigned to a rubbish dump , but it must be subjected to a pre-treatment process .
greece : richard galpin in the cramped offices of the ecological recycling society in central athens , philip kirkitsos hits me with some alarming statistics .
every year , he says , one billion plastic drinking water bottles are thrown away in greece , along with one billion soft drinks bottles and yet another billion plastic containers for cleaning fluids .
almost one-fifth of the entire waste produced by this country is plastic , and yet just 1 % of it is recycled .
greece , he admits , is at least 15 years behind the rest of the eu in almost all areas of recycling and is unlikely to meet eu targets for next year .
in athens the recycling bins so common in most european cities are a rare sight .
although recently the authorities have launched new schemes , the impact so far seems to be minimal .
recycling just is not high on the list of priorities for the average athenian .
most bags of household waste contain large amounts of glass , metal , paper and plastic which end up being dumped at the city 's only landfill which - not surprisingly - is now almost full .
as a result , the capital currently faces an acute waste management crisis because no alternative sites have been set up .
ironically the city does have what is believed to be europe 's largest recycling plant , built next to the landfill four years ago .
but the plant - estimated to have cost at least 75m euros -lrb- £ 50m -rrb- - has stood idle .
the reason ?
it was badly damaged by a mountain of rubbish which collapsed on top of it .
italy : jeremy bowen waste disposal regulations in italy vary from district to district .
in rome , the rules were toughened earlier this month .
people who do not separate their rubbish can be fined up to 619 euros if they have a recycling bin within 500 metres of their front door .
romans often claim that it is hard to find a bin and even harder to find one that is not full .
the city council has ordered 2,500 new bins .
they are colour-coded green for household waste , white for paper and blue for plastic .
the streets of the historic centre of rome have almost no recycling bins yet .
the streets are cleaned very efficiently , by vehicles that drive over waste and suck it up like enormous self-propelled vacuum cleaners .
in southern italy local politicians claim that the waste management industry is controlled by organised crime .
last year the european commission said it was taking action against italy , for 28 breaches of eu laws on the environment .
it said that italy was denying its citizens the same quality of life enjoyed by people in other eu countries .
when i moved here five months ago i asked the caretaker of my building whether i should separate my family 's rubbish .
he laughed and looked incredulous .
" are you joking ? " he said .
" this is rome . "
senegal hamadou tidiane sy recycling is not done on an industrial scale , but it is part of daily life for many resourceful senegalese .
everything is recycled , from plastic bags to school exercise books , food cans , bottles of mineral water and even fruit peel .
the peel is said to be collected for use in cheap perfume .
tomato tins become drinking cups in rural areas or are used by beggars in the streets , old newspapers and administrative documents are used to wrap bread , fruit or peanuts you buy in the street .
some artisans also use metal waste to produce anything from chairs to kitchen utensils and children 's toys .
plastic bags are used to make shoes .
in the old days , worn tyres used to be made into sandals , but these are much less popular now .
recently , some smart people have started collecting all the metal waste they can find to send it back to factories in europe .
the swiss waste disposal firm alcyon has signed a contract with the government worth more than $ 9m to collect and treat rubbish in the capital dakar .
the project is being managed by ama-senegal , which will remove a huge tip called mbeubeuss and recycle much of the city 's waste .

most observers did not even think mahmoud ahmadinejad would make it past the first round of polling a week ago .
then it was thought he was neck-and-neck with his rival , former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani .
now tehran 's hardline mayor seems to have defied all forecasts , with a landslide victory putting him far ahead of the better-known mr rafsanjani .
iranians have voted not so much on his ideological position - some of them have overlooked that in a way .
it was his appeal to the poor that seems to be the secret to mr ahmadinejad 's success .
despite iran 's huge oil wealth , the country has an unemployment problem and a big gap between rich and poor .
people see a lot of consumerism , very conspicuous spending in tehran among the elite , but they do not themselves see the results of the country 's oil boom .
the vote seems to have been one against the status quo - a sign of deep economic frustration .
mr rafsanjani is seen as an establishment figure , a senior cleric who has always been at the top of the revolutionary elite .
instead iranians have chosen an alternative , younger man who talks in the revolutionary slogans of redistributing the country 's oil wealth , re-nationalising the assets .
but for liberals , mr ahmadinejad 's ascent to power is worrying .
it is expected he will want to reverse some of the social freedoms introduced by the reformists and take a harder line on nuclear negotiations with the west .
his victory now puts all the organs of state in the hands of the hardliners .

iranians have voted not so much on his ideological position - some of them have overlooked that in a way .
it was his appeal to the poor that seems to be the secret to mr ahmadinejad 's success .
despite iran 's huge oil wealth , the country has an unemployment problem and a big gap between rich and poor .
people see a lot of consumerism , very conspicuous spending in tehran among the elite , but they do not themselves see the results of the country 's oil boom .
the vote seems to have been one against the status quo - a sign of deep economic frustration .
mr rafsanjani is seen as an establishment figure , a senior cleric who has always been at the top of the revolutionary elite .
instead iranians have chosen an alternative , younger man who talks in the revolutionary slogans of redistributing the country 's oil wealth , re-nationalising the assets .
but for liberals , mr ahmadinejad 's ascent to power is worrying .
it is expected he will want to reverse some of the social freedoms introduced by the reformists and take a harder line on nuclear negotiations with the west .
his victory now puts all the organs of state in the hands of the hardliners .

representatives from the games industry taking part in a conference in london this week heard that more than 20 million chinese were playing games and the number was rising fast .
china is set for a big explosion in spending on entertainment , largely fuelled by online sales of video games , a report this week predicted .
last year , chinese players spent almost us $ 500m on online games .
the amount of money being spent on games has led to a sea change in the attitude of officials , who used to see games as similar to gambling and laziness .
" the government is encouraging and supporting the development of online games , " said sunray zhaohui liu , president of the beijing-based new synergy consulting firm .
the authorities are hoping to attract more foreign investment in games by hosting a two-day games conference in september in beijing .
explosive growth china is the world 's most populous country , with a population of 1.3 billion .
of these , 500 million live in the cities , where they have cheap and easy access to online games via internet cafes .
" in the big net cafes in beijing you can have several hundred pcs , " explained mr zhaohui liu .
" most people there are under 30 and this is how they get access to broadband to play online games . "
an estimated 22.8 million people play online games according to figures from 2004 , spending almost us $ 500m on their favourite past time .
" the online gaming market is flying high in asia , " said mr zhaohui liu .
his comments have been echoed by a report by pricewaterhousecoopers looking at the next five years for entertainment .
it said the asia-pacific region could be expected to enjoy the fastest growth in spending on leisure , such as video games , casino gaming , tv distribution and music .
the report said the massive growth in china meant it would overtake japan as the region 's biggest market by 2008 .
monthly fees the only cloud on the horizon in asia-pacific is the persistent threat of piracy .
this is one of the reasons why console gaming has yet to take off in china .
console makers such as microsoft , sony and nintendo rely on game sales for much of their money .
but widespread counterfeiting means pirated games are easily available for a fraction of the price of the retail copy .
it is another reason why online gaming has proved such a money-spinner as gamers pay to play .
mr zhaohui liu highlighted the success of the massively multiplayer online role playing game , world of warcraft .
the game was launched in china at the beginning of june , with gamers paying five cents an hour to play .
the title was phenomenally successful , with the most number of chinese playing at once reaching 450,000 .
" with the fast growth of the chinese market , the number of world of warcraft paid subscribers worldwide broke through two million this month , " said mr zhaohui liu .
official obstacles as well as offering opportunities for western game makers , china also presented challenges due to the tight regulation of games .
" games are a very serious business in china , " said mr zhaohui liu , explaining that three government ministries covered video games .
last year a swedish game called hearts of iron was banned for portraying manchuria , tibet and xinjiang as independent nations , while a norwegian shoot-em-up also angered the authorities .
" we have different political systems , " explained mr zhaohui liu diplomatically .
" that means we judge things from different angles so maybe in some areas we have different opinions . "
at the same time , concerns are growing about the amount of time youngsters spend playing games , as well as the sort of violent games they are playing .
" we do n't have a rating system in china , so there are some problems growing with the fast growing online market , " said the chinese analyst .

the authorities are hoping to attract more foreign investment in games by hosting a two-day games conference in september in beijing .

console makers such as microsoft , sony and nintendo rely on game sales for much of their money .
world of warcraft has proved a big hit with chinese gamers but widespread counterfeiting means pirated games are easily available for a fraction of the price of the retail copy .

last year a swedish game called hearts of iron was banned for portraying manchuria , tibet and xinjiang as independent nations , while a norwegian shoot-em-up also angered the authorities .

campsites , hotels and other attractions have had cancellations from people believing most of the area had been hit , a report says .
the bbc 's danny savage says damage was confined to only a few villages in the thirsk and helmsley areas .
the tourist board is trying to reassure visitors it is " business as usual " .
' business as usual ' " by the early hours of monday morning the flood waters had subsided , " the bbc correspondent said .
" but it appears the reports have put off visitors , with one caravan park owner losing several hundred pounds worth of business within half an hour , despite being more than 20 miles from the flood-hit area . "
jenny royle from the yorkshire tourist board told bbc news : " we 've had telephone calls asking us if it 's still possible to get through to york and even calls in to a caravan site in scarborough asking if they 've been swept away .
" tourism in north yorkshire is worth about £ 1.6bn every year .
i think it 's important to remember we 're talking about very small businesses here , businesses run by one or two people , " she said .
the environment agency has announced it is to hold two flood surgeries in thirsk and helmsley this week to give people the chance to find out how and why the floods happened .

" but it appears the reports have put off visitors , with one caravan park owner losing several hundred pounds worth of business within half an hour , despite being more than 20 miles from the flood-hit area . "
jenny royle from the yorkshire tourist board told bbc news : " we 've had telephone calls asking us if it 's still possible to get through to york and even calls in to a caravan site in scarborough asking if they 've been swept away .
" tourism in north yorkshire is worth about £ 1.6bn every year .
i think it 's important to remember we 're talking about very small businesses here , businesses run by one or two people , " she said .
the environment agency has announced it is to hold two flood surgeries in thirsk and helmsley this week to give people the chance to find out how and why the floods happened .
