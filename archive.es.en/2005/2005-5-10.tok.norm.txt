program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2005 exits spark deutsche börse speculation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't looking bullish for frankfurt these days the resignations of deutsche börse 's chief executive and chairman this week have reignited speculation of a possible tie-up between the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange and its french-led arch-rival , euronext . the children 's investment fund -lrb- tci -rrb- , which successfully thwarted deutsche börse 's ambitions to take over the london stock exchange and was instrumental in toppling ceo werner seifert and supervisory board chief rolf breuer , suggested tuesday that the german company should tie the knot with the operator of the paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon exchanges . " it would be fantastic .
from a structural point of view , the two -lrb- platforms -rrb- would fit together well .
it would make more sense than a costly acquisition of the lse , " tci director patrick degorce told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert and rolf breuer it was tci , deutsche börse 's biggest shareholder with a stake of around eight percent , that threw a spanner in the works for frankfurt 's plans to swallow the lse .
and the london-based hedge fund also forced seifert and breuer to leave of their own accord before they were effectively booted out . now , it appears that tci wants to have its say in deutsche börse 's strategy as well .
degorce said that a tie-up between the german firm and euronext " would be good for europe 's financial markets " because it would help cut costs for users , including tci itself . speculation not new a merger would be made easier by the fact that half of the shareholders of the frankfurt stock exchange also own about half of euronext .
it is not the first time that such a combination has been the subject of speculation . " the merger would involve significant cost and revenue synergies , create a european champion and lessen the risk of seeing deutsche börse and euronext fighting separately for expensive targets -lrb- such as the lse -rrb- , " said exane bnp paribas analyst , claire langevin , in paris . on the other hand , a tie-up could raise competitive concerns since it would give birth to a near-monopoly in derivative products traded on the eurex and liffe futures markets , she cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange and at present , euronext appears to have little desire to tie the knot with frankfurt .
it wants to focus on its own bid to buy the lse , currently being looked at by the british regulatory authorities , a source close to the matter told the afp news agency . for deutsche börse , the spectacular failure of its various attempts to get its hands on the lse over the past few years and the ignoble ejection of seifert and breuer means the german operator must go back to the drawing board in its plans to become europe 's leading player . germany marginalized ? " if deutsche börse loses out to euronext on the lse , it may risk being marginalized in europe , " said citigroup smith barney analyst daniel garrod . the debacle has clearly demonstrated the power of investment funds in decisions about corporate strategy .
in the immediate term , the temporary lack of leadership will not necessarily harm deutsche börse , garrod said .
the german exchange " is fundamentally in good shape , " he said .
and unlike other companies that have undergone a management reshuffle , " the role of ceo will be more attractive to a new hire , " the analyst suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , seifert 's successor , whom deutsche börse has indicated will be an outside candidate , will have to come to terms with the power of the investment funds .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .

" the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .

the acquisition , which took place in a number of different transactions , was effected by the investment vehicle of the herz family , mayfair vermoegensverwaltung , puma said in a statement .
of the 16.91-percent stake , a holding of 9.78 percent still had to be approved by the competition authorities , puma added .
at current market prices , the 16.91-percent stake in puma is worth around 550 million euros -lrb- $ 704 million dollars -rrb- .
puma shares responded to the announcement by racing ahead by 7.25 euros or 3.97 percent to 189.84 euros .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said that the company had not been previously aware of mayfair as a shareholder .
but under german law , investors are obliged to reveal their shareholdings in a company only if they acquire more than five percent of the share capital .
mayfair is the only major shareholder in puma , with the rest of the company 's share capital in free float on the frankfurt stock exchange .
puma chairman jochen zeitz welcomed the advent of a new major shareholder .
" we welcome mayfair as a new shareholder and also welcome the investment in the company , " he said . more briefs 10.05.2005 -pipe- german trade surplus rises in march 09.05.2005 -pipe- fujitsu-siemens plans longer work week 09.05.2005 -pipe- deutsche post delivers higher profits 09.05.2005 -pipe- german industrial output declines 06.05.2005 -pipe- german factory orders rise again 06.05.2005 -pipe- easyjet eyes new german ventures 06.05.2005 -pipe- german supermarket to sell train tickets 04.05.2005 -pipe- allianz beats expectations 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .

cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .
indescribable horrors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information center of the holocaust memorial holocaust survivor sabina van der linden of sydney , australia , told of the " indescribable horrors " that she had experienced as an 11-year-old child in nazi germany .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- poland plans to hold a referendum on the european constitution to coincide with presidential elections in late 2005 .
the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

" it would be fantastic .
from a structural point of view , the two -lrb- platforms -rrb- would fit together well .
it would make more sense than a costly acquisition of the lse , " tci director patrick degorce told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert and rolf breuer it was tci , deutsche börse 's biggest shareholder with a stake of around eight percent , that threw a spanner in the works for frankfurt 's plans to swallow the lse .
and the london-based hedge fund also forced seifert and breuer to leave of their own accord before they were effectively booted out . now , it appears that tci wants to have its say in deutsche börse 's strategy as well .
degorce said that a tie-up between the german firm and euronext " would be good for europe 's financial markets " because it would help cut costs for users , including tci itself . speculation not new a merger would be made easier by the fact that half of the shareholders of the frankfurt stock exchange also own about half of euronext .
it is not the first time that such a combination has been the subject of speculation . " the merger would involve significant cost and revenue synergies , create a european champion and lessen the risk of seeing deutsche börse and euronext fighting separately for expensive targets -lrb- such as the lse -rrb- , " said exane bnp paribas analyst , claire langevin , in paris . on the other hand , a tie-up could raise competitive concerns since it would give birth to a near-monopoly in derivative products traded on the eurex and liffe futures markets , she cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange and at present , euronext appears to have little desire to tie the knot with frankfurt .
it wants to focus on its own bid to buy the lse , currently being looked at by the british regulatory authorities , a source close to the matter told the afp news agency . for deutsche börse , the spectacular failure of its various attempts to get its hands on the lse over the past few years and the ignoble ejection of seifert and breuer means the german operator must go back to the drawing board in its plans to become europe 's leading player . germany marginalized ? " if deutsche börse loses out to euronext on the lse , it may risk being marginalized in europe , " said citigroup smith barney analyst daniel garrod . the debacle has clearly demonstrated the power of investment funds in decisions about corporate strategy .
in the immediate term , the temporary lack of leadership will not necessarily harm deutsche börse , garrod said .
the german exchange " is fundamentally in good shape , " he said .
and unlike other companies that have undergone a management reshuffle , " the role of ceo will be more attractive to a new hire , " the analyst suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , seifert 's successor , whom deutsche börse has indicated will be an outside candidate , will have to come to terms with the power of the investment funds .
so it may take some time before an adequate replacement can be found . merck finck analyst konrad becker suggested that deutsche börse might even be broken up and sold off to fund higher payments promised to shareholders .
in the long courtship of the lse by deutsche börse , lse users frequently argued that the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the german company , combining all different activities from trading to clearing and settlement , was unattractive . that could therefore place a question mark over deutsche börse 's luxembourg-based unit clearstream or even the highly profitable eurex venture with the swiss stock exchange , analysts said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse chief steps down two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .

paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .

he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2005 exits spark deutsche börse speculation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't looking bullish for frankfurt these days the resignations of deutsche börse 's chief executive and chairman this week have reignited speculation of a possible tie-up between the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange and its french-led arch-rival , euronext . the children 's investment fund -lrb- tci -rrb- , which successfully thwarted deutsche börse 's ambitions to take over the london stock exchange and was instrumental in toppling ceo werner seifert and supervisory board chief rolf breuer , suggested tuesday that the german company should tie the knot with the operator of the paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon exchanges . " it would be fantastic .
from a structural point of view , the two -lrb- platforms -rrb- would fit together well .
it would make more sense than a costly acquisition of the lse , " tci director patrick degorce told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert and rolf breuer it was tci , deutsche börse 's biggest shareholder with a stake of around eight percent , that threw a spanner in the works for frankfurt 's plans to swallow the lse .
and the london-based hedge fund also forced seifert and breuer to leave of their own accord before they were effectively booted out . now , it appears that tci wants to have its say in deutsche börse 's strategy as well .
degorce said that a tie-up between the german firm and euronext " would be good for europe 's financial markets " because it would help cut costs for users , including tci itself . speculation not new a merger would be made easier by the fact that half of the shareholders of the frankfurt stock exchange also own about half of euronext .
it is not the first time that such a combination has been the subject of speculation . " the merger would involve significant cost and revenue synergies , create a european champion and lessen the risk of seeing deutsche börse and euronext fighting separately for expensive targets -lrb- such as the lse -rrb- , " said exane bnp paribas analyst , claire langevin , in paris . on the other hand , a tie-up could raise competitive concerns since it would give birth to a near-monopoly in derivative products traded on the eurex and liffe futures markets , she cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange and at present , euronext appears to have little desire to tie the knot with frankfurt .
it wants to focus on its own bid to buy the lse , currently being looked at by the british regulatory authorities , a source close to the matter told the afp news agency . for deutsche börse , the spectacular failure of its various attempts to get its hands on the lse over the past few years and the ignoble ejection of seifert and breuer means the german operator must go back to the drawing board in its plans to become europe 's leading player . germany marginalized ? " if deutsche börse loses out to euronext on the lse , it may risk being marginalized in europe , " said citigroup smith barney analyst daniel garrod . the debacle has clearly demonstrated the power of investment funds in decisions about corporate strategy .
in the immediate term , the temporary lack of leadership will not necessarily harm deutsche börse , garrod said .
the german exchange " is fundamentally in good shape , " he said .
and unlike other companies that have undergone a management reshuffle , " the role of ceo will be more attractive to a new hire , " the analyst suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , seifert 's successor , whom deutsche börse has indicated will be an outside candidate , will have to come to terms with the power of the investment funds .
so it may take some time before an adequate replacement can be found . merck finck analyst konrad becker suggested that deutsche börse might even be broken up and sold off to fund higher payments promised to shareholders .
in the long courtship of the lse by deutsche börse , lse users frequently argued that the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the german company , combining all different activities from trading to clearing and settlement , was unattractive . that could therefore place a question mark over deutsche börse 's luxembourg-based unit clearstream or even the highly profitable eurex venture with the swiss stock exchange , analysts said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse chief steps down two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange .
-lrb- may 10 , 2005 -rrb- deutsche börse facing hostile lse bid problems are piling up for deutsche börse in its drive to acquire the london stock exchange and could force the frankfurt stock market operator to launch a hostile bid .
-lrb- feb .
27 , 2005 -rrb- opportunity or risk for deutsche börse ?
germany 's largest stock exchange , the deutsche börse in frankfurt , is attempting to take over the london stock exchange .
many see the fusion as a great opportunity in the markets , but not everyone is enthusiastic .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .

paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- poland plans to hold a referendum on the european constitution to coincide with presidential elections in late 2005 .
the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.05.2005 explaining mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument aims to teach as well as cause reflection on tuesday , a memorial to the european jews murdered by the nazi regime opens in berlin .
under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 poll says germans support eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , a referendum campaign is underway the german parliament will decide on the fate of the new eu constitution on thursday .
the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .
cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .
german politicians believe that clear parliamentary support for the eu charter would have an impact on the flagging pro-constitution campaign of their french counterparts . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects german eu referendum plea the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .
german chancellor gerhard schroeder came to central poland to support the polish government 's campaign for a ' yes " vote in this weeks 's referendum on membership of the european union .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- poland plans to hold a referendum on the european constitution to coincide with presidential elections in late 2005 .
the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .
cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .
german politicians believe that clear parliamentary support for the eu charter would have an impact on the flagging pro-constitution campaign of their french counterparts . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects german eu referendum plea the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .
-lrb- april 18 , 2005 -rrb- a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution .
-lrb- feb .
20 , 2005 -rrb- the rocky road to an eu constitution the eui constitution must be ratified by all 25 eu members to come into force , not a easy feat , since it is by no means supported by everyone .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .
indescribable horrors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information center of the holocaust memorial holocaust survivor sabina van der linden of sydney , australia , told of the " indescribable horrors " that she had experienced as an 11-year-old child in nazi germany .
her family 's history is documented in the underground information center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.05.2005 eu and russia agree to strengthen ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's relations with eu leaders have n't always been chummy russian president vladimir putin hailed tuesday a pact forged with the european union to boost cooperation with the expanding bloc .
he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 holocaust monument dedicated in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an inaugural walk among the pillars sixty years after the end of wwii and 17 years after its inception , a german memorial to the jewish victims of wwii genocide has been dedicated in berlin . the president of the german parliament , the monument 's architect and the head of the central council of jews in germany were among those who made speeches as the 19,000 square meter -lrb- 4.7 acres -rrb- memorial - a field of cement slabs situated at the brandenburg gate - was officially dedicated .
also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .
indescribable horrors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information center of the holocaust memorial holocaust survivor sabina van der linden of sydney , australia , told of the " indescribable horrors " that she had experienced as an 11-year-old child in nazi germany .
her family 's history is documented in the underground information center .
one ca n't hold descendants responsible for their parents ' acts , van der linden said .
" but you can hold them responsible for what they do with the memories of their ancestors ' crimes .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .

paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .

for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .

but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 poll says germans support eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , a referendum campaign is underway the german parliament will decide on the fate of the new eu constitution on thursday .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .

their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector . " german-polish relations are definitely still a highly fragile construct , " said hubert wohlan , editor of " non-elective affinites " and head of deutsche welle 's polish program . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin moves to counter wage dumping the german government has formed a new task force to battle wage dumping and examine ways to expand minimum wages to some sectors as the eu 's eastward expansion brings in an influx of cheap labor .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 poll says germans support eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , a referendum campaign is underway the german parliament will decide on the fate of the new eu constitution on thursday .
the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .
cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .
german politicians believe that clear parliamentary support for the eu charter would have an impact on the flagging pro-constitution campaign of their french counterparts . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects german eu referendum plea the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .

he said the agreement will create a " greater europe " despite recent strains with the eu . the russian leader was speaking at a russia-eu summit to approve four " road map " accords to bolster cooperation in areas ranging from trade and investment to the fight against terrorism . " the strategic partnership with the eu is an important priority for russia .
i am convinced that adoption of these road maps which is expected today will allow us to build a greater europe , " he said . shortly before the start of the talks russia and an eu official confirmed " road map " accords had been reached on four policy areas : the economy ; freedom , security and justice ; external security ; and research , education and culture . negotiations had been snagged notably on demands by the 25-nation eu for a firm linkage between an accord to ease visa rules and an agreement on the re-admission of illegal immigrants .
but officials said this was virtually resolved and would be adopted by the eu leaders during the three-hour summit . " the work between experts and officials of russia and the eu was not easy , but it is going ahead and i hope we will continue to cooperate constructively in the future , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission chief jose manuel barroso and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker the eu was represented by foreign policy chief javier solana , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker - whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , and eu commission chief jose manuel barroso . barroso paid tribute to russia as a " european " country on the eve of the talks .
" russia is a bridge from europe to asia , and we can be happy that we share the same values , " he said on the eve of the talks . repairing ties the moscow summit was aimed at repairing ties battered in recent years : an attempt to agree on the four " road map " accords foundered last year when russia was angered by perceived eu interference in ukraine . threats to a harmonious summit this time have focussed on strains between russia and the eu 's three ex-soviet baltic newcomer states , one of which had hoped until recently to a sign a border accord with moscow at the summit .
estonia , latvia and lithuania were occupied by stalin 's soviet union following a nazi-soviet pact in 1939 and were forcibly assimilated into the soviet union at the end of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia map eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner conceded ahead of the talks that the latvia-russian border issue remains " delicate " and is not yet resolved .
" we understand that there are always difficulties of the past .
we all have to work to get rid of these difficult memories .
but at the same time this is really about looking to the future , " she said . another cause of concern for the eu are so-called " frozen conflicts " in russia 's ex-soviet backyard near the expanded bloc 's borders .
one eu official said the eu was " extremely disappointed " that moscow had failed to implement an accord signed in 1999 to withdraw russian forces notably in georgia and moldova . ferrero-waldner added that she hoped the summit - a day after world leaders gathered for ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii - would focus on the future , not the troubled past . " it is an important moment to look to the future together with russia , " she told reporters on the eve of the eu-russia talks . the eu-russia summit came a day after over 50 heads of state and government gathered in moscow for ceremonies to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : no more wars a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .

the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .

it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

" if deutsche börse loses out to euronext on the lse , it may risk being marginalized in europe , " said citigroup smith barney analyst daniel garrod . the debacle has clearly demonstrated the power of investment funds in decisions about corporate strategy .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .

for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 poll says germans support eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , a referendum campaign is underway the german parliament will decide on the fate of the new eu constitution on thursday .
the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public . the latest survey carried out by the infratest pollsters shows 59 percent of germans back the new constitution .
only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .
and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .
cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .
german politicians believe that clear parliamentary support for the eu charter would have an impact on the flagging pro-constitution campaign of their french counterparts . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects german eu referendum plea the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .
-lrb- april 18 , 2005 -rrb- a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.05.2005 explaining mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument aims to teach as well as cause reflection on tuesday , a memorial to the european jews murdered by the nazi regime opens in berlin .
under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 doctors defect to blissful britain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hospital structures could use a shot of sensitivity germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.05.2005 explaining mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument aims to teach as well as cause reflection on tuesday , a memorial to the european jews murdered by the nazi regime opens in berlin .
under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.05.2005 exits spark deutsche börse speculation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't looking bullish for frankfurt these days the resignations of deutsche börse 's chief executive and chairman this week have reignited speculation of a possible tie-up between the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange and its french-led arch-rival , euronext . the children 's investment fund -lrb- tci -rrb- , which successfully thwarted deutsche börse 's ambitions to take over the london stock exchange and was instrumental in toppling ceo werner seifert and supervisory board chief rolf breuer , suggested tuesday that the german company should tie the knot with the operator of the paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon exchanges . " it would be fantastic .
from a structural point of view , the two -lrb- platforms -rrb- would fit together well .
it would make more sense than a costly acquisition of the lse , " tci director patrick degorce told the business daily handelsblatt in an interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert and rolf breuer it was tci , deutsche börse 's biggest shareholder with a stake of around eight percent , that threw a spanner in the works for frankfurt 's plans to swallow the lse .
and the london-based hedge fund also forced seifert and breuer to leave of their own accord before they were effectively booted out . now , it appears that tci wants to have its say in deutsche börse 's strategy as well .
degorce said that a tie-up between the german firm and euronext " would be good for europe 's financial markets " because it would help cut costs for users , including tci itself . speculation not new a merger would be made easier by the fact that half of the shareholders of the frankfurt stock exchange also own about half of euronext .
it is not the first time that such a combination has been the subject of speculation . " the merger would involve significant cost and revenue synergies , create a european champion and lessen the risk of seeing deutsche börse and euronext fighting separately for expensive targets -lrb- such as the lse -rrb- , " said exane bnp paribas analyst , claire langevin , in paris . on the other hand , a tie-up could raise competitive concerns since it would give birth to a near-monopoly in derivative products traded on the eurex and liffe futures markets , she cautioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange and at present , euronext appears to have little desire to tie the knot with frankfurt .
it wants to focus on its own bid to buy the lse , currently being looked at by the british regulatory authorities , a source close to the matter told the afp news agency . for deutsche börse , the spectacular failure of its various attempts to get its hands on the lse over the past few years and the ignoble ejection of seifert and breuer means the german operator must go back to the drawing board in its plans to become europe 's leading player . germany marginalized ? " if deutsche börse loses out to euronext on the lse , it may risk being marginalized in europe , " said citigroup smith barney analyst daniel garrod . the debacle has clearly demonstrated the power of investment funds in decisions about corporate strategy .
in the immediate term , the temporary lack of leadership will not necessarily harm deutsche börse , garrod said .
the german exchange " is fundamentally in good shape , " he said .
and unlike other companies that have undergone a management reshuffle , " the role of ceo will be more attractive to a new hire , " the analyst suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nevertheless , seifert 's successor , whom deutsche börse has indicated will be an outside candidate , will have to come to terms with the power of the investment funds .
so it may take some time before an adequate replacement can be found . merck finck analyst konrad becker suggested that deutsche börse might even be broken up and sold off to fund higher payments promised to shareholders .
in the long courtship of the lse by deutsche börse , lse users frequently argued that the so-called " vertical silo " structure of the german company , combining all different activities from trading to clearing and settlement , was unattractive . that could therefore place a question mark over deutsche börse 's luxembourg-based unit clearstream or even the highly profitable eurex venture with the swiss stock exchange , analysts said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse chief steps down two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.05.2005 explaining mass murder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monument aims to teach as well as cause reflection on tuesday , a memorial to the european jews murdered by the nazi regime opens in berlin .
under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .

for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- poland plans to hold a referendum on the european constitution to coincide with presidential elections in late 2005 .
the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .
german chancellor gerhard schroeder came to central poland to support the polish government 's campaign for a ' yes " vote in this weeks 's referendum on membership of the european union .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- poland plans to hold a referendum on the european constitution to coincide with presidential elections in late 2005 .
the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector . " german-polish relations are definitely still a highly fragile construct , " said hubert wohlan , editor of " non-elective affinites " and head of deutsche welle 's polish program . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin moves to counter wage dumping the german government has formed a new task force to battle wage dumping and examine ways to expand minimum wages to some sectors as the eu 's eastward expansion brings in an influx of cheap labor .

he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .
indescribable horrors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information center of the holocaust memorial holocaust survivor sabina van der linden of sydney , australia , told of the " indescribable horrors " that she had experienced as an 11-year-old child in nazi germany .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : between the cement pillars symbol of ' incomprehensibility ' addressing the invitees , bundestag president wolfgang theirse called the monument " a constructed symbol for the incomprehensibility of the crime . "
he added that the german parliament 's vote in 1999 to approve and fund the monument was the first decision for a memorial project in a unified germany .
as such , " it represents unified germany 's recognition of its own history , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse thierse added that the monument is not , " the stony finale of the public debate of our nazi history . "
with fewer and fewer survivors living to tell holocaust stories , monuments are increasingly important , thierse said .
" what today can be hauntingly told by eye witnesses , in the future will need to be told by museums and by art . "
for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "
the field of stelae is meant to be provocative in its simplicity , eisenman said .
indescribable horrors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information center of the holocaust memorial holocaust survivor sabina van der linden of sydney , australia , told of the " indescribable horrors " that she had experienced as an 11-year-old child in nazi germany .
her family 's history is documented in the underground information center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.05.2005 doctors defect to blissful britain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hospital structures could use a shot of sensitivity germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

the acquisition , which took place in a number of different transactions , was effected by the investment vehicle of the herz family , mayfair vermoegensverwaltung , puma said in a statement .
of the 16.91-percent stake , a holding of 9.78 percent still had to be approved by the competition authorities , puma added .
at current market prices , the 16.91-percent stake in puma is worth around 550 million euros -lrb- $ 704 million dollars -rrb- .
puma shares responded to the announcement by racing ahead by 7.25 euros or 3.97 percent to 189.84 euros .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said that the company had not been previously aware of mayfair as a shareholder .
but under german law , investors are obliged to reveal their shareholdings in a company only if they acquire more than five percent of the share capital .
mayfair is the only major shareholder in puma , with the rest of the company 's share capital in free float on the frankfurt stock exchange .
puma chairman jochen zeitz welcomed the advent of a new major shareholder .
" we welcome mayfair as a new shareholder and also welcome the investment in the company , " he said . more briefs 10.05.2005 -pipe- german trade surplus rises in march 09.05.2005 -pipe- fujitsu-siemens plans longer work week 09.05.2005 -pipe- deutsche post delivers higher profits 09.05.2005 -pipe- german industrial output declines 06.05.2005 -pipe- german factory orders rise again 06.05.2005 -pipe- easyjet eyes new german ventures 06.05.2005 -pipe- german supermarket to sell train tickets 04.05.2005 -pipe- allianz beats expectations 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

also present were some 1,500 guests from around the world , including many holocaust survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us architect peter eisenman with publicist lea rosh " it is an honor to give this monument to the german people , " american architect peter eisenman -lrb- photo , with lea rosh -rrb- told the assembled guests , who included german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .
the monument consists of 2,711 cement pillars , or stelae , of different heights , that visitors can walk among .
the sculpture and underground information and documentation center cost 27.6 million euros to build .
starting on thursday , it will be open to the public .

for spiegel , the dedication ceremony was a chance to honor those who made the monument reality -lrb- he named its initiators lea rosh and eberhard jäckel , among others -rrb- while sharply criticizing what he saw as a serious flaw .
too much focus on victims " by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " spiegel told the assembled crowd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel therefore , he said , the underground information center - a concept added late in the project 's development - was an " indispensable addition . "
still , he complained that " only a few of the visitors will bother to gather additional facts . ...
it would have been better if the perpetrators ' motives had been addressed " in the design of the sculpture itself .
for his part , us based architect peter eisenman told the crowd he wanted to leave behind a " lasting memorial to the killing of jews by the nazis . "

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .

only about 15 percent would vote against it if a referendum were held in germany , will be the case in britain and france . but the overwhelming support for the pro-eu camp in germany is somewhat tarnished by the fact that about a quarter of germans say they feel they are not sufficiently informed about the new constitution .

and , indeed , in spite of general support for the european project , the negative effects of the recent round of eu enlargement on german jobs appears to have unsettled many germans . fear of change when quizzed , some germans say they feel the new eu states have come too quickly , and that the changes are too daunting .
these emotions have been taken up by german euroskeptics , especially germany ’ s conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber the ultra-conservative leader of the christian social union , edmund stoiber , for example , has demanded that conditions for the admission of romania and bulgaria , scheduled for 2007 , be renegotiated .
he fears that cheap labor from these countries would put additional pressure on german jobs , which have already been slashed - partly as a result of low-cost competition from eastern europe . this view is also shared by other conservatives such as the cdu state premier of saarland , peter müller . " the admission of 10 new countries has created a number of problems for the job market , " müller said .
" freedom to travel and to start businesses in the service sector all over the eu has intensified competition .
germans have been overwhelmed by this process and need more time to adapt to it . " sure ' yes ' vote in spite of some conservative concerns , the eu constitution is not at risk of failing in the bundestag vote on thursday .
cdu leader angela merkel said she would be able to convince about 20 party renegades to vote in favor .
most german campaigning on the issue is currently focused on france , where german foreign minister joschka fischer has been canvassing for a yes vote in the referedum to be held there at the end of may . following the vote in the german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , there will be a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat later in may .
german politicians believe that clear parliamentary support for the eu charter would have an impact on the flagging pro-constitution campaign of their french counterparts . uwe hessler -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court rejects german eu referendum plea the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .
-lrb- april 18 , 2005 -rrb- a rough road to ratification three countries have already said " yes " to the eu constitution .
on sunday , spain becomes the first country to put the matter directly to the people .
here 's a look at the remaining hurdles for the constitution .

the acquisition , which took place in a number of different transactions , was effected by the investment vehicle of the herz family , mayfair vermoegensverwaltung , puma said in a statement .
of the 16.91-percent stake , a holding of 9.78 percent still had to be approved by the competition authorities , puma added .

mayfair is the only major shareholder in puma , with the rest of the company 's share capital in free float on the frankfurt stock exchange .
puma chairman jochen zeitz welcomed the advent of a new major shareholder .

but are relations as rosy as they look ? to the strains of beethoven 's 9th symphony and a rendition of john lennon 's " imagine , " germany 's state secretary for media and culture christina weiss and her polish counterpart waldemar dabrowski kicked off proceedings sunday and heralded what they hope will be a new dawn for german-polish relations . as the fireworks exploded , a team of actors recited friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy " and cabaret artistes entertained the thousands of spectators who 'd gathered on the bridge for the festivities . " this is where the division of our continent was most painful , and where our newly discovered unity was most joyous , " said weiss . " german-polish year is designed to foreground the intellectual dimension of bilateral relations , " she said .
the extensive cultural program featuring a total of some 1000 concerts , screenings , readings and lectures is set to run until may 2006 .
another aspect is the many city partnerships set up to boost cross-border friendship , while on may 23 , the willy brandt center in breslau will be hosting a book presentation of " non-elective affinities , " a collection of stories focusing on the german-polish relationship . driving towards understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representing one of the more unusual faces of the scheme , participants from the cross-cultural project " tridem 2005 cultural rally paris - berlin - warsaw " also put in an appearance .
on april 29 , 100 young french , german and polish contestants took to the road for a fortnight-long voyage of cultural discovery , taking in sights with particular symbolism for european identity .
their journey also marked a handover from the 2004 french-polish year to the current german-polish year . project patrons are polish prime minister marek belka , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin and chancellor gerhard schröder . " tridem is an effective symbol for the cultural ties between our three countries , " said weiss . " antidote to past traumas " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and polish president aleksander kwasniewski officially opened german-polish year last week at the landmark concert house in central berlin . " in our long history , germany and poland have never been so close , " said köhler , pointing out that the appointment of a german pope to succeed karol wojtyla is just one recent development that has helped bring the countries closer together . the two statesmen also underlined the progress made in atoning for the atrocities of wwii . " the opening towards one another of germany and poland is an antidote to past traumas as well as stereotypes that have been cultivated for years , " said kwasniewski . poland and the eu köhler described poland 's accession to the eu one year ago as a " huge success , " pointing out that the polish economy was developing well and emphasizing the economic energy kickstarted by eu entry . even so , the bonhomie masked an undercurrent of discomfort between the two countries , brushing under the carpet tension over the wage-dumping issue gathering steam since the eu 's eastwards expansion , as well as poland 's own reservations regarding the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman holds a placard signing ' no eu ' during a small demonstration near the national theater in the city of lodz , poland , on wednesday , june 4 , 2003 .

the country is seen to be somewhat skeptical towards the constitution , and a yes vote is by no means guaranteed . key issues for the poles are the reduction of voting powers implicated by the constitution , compared to the structure set down at nice , as well as widespread feeling that the country was short-changed when it joined the eu , particularly its agricultural sector .

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

paul spiegel , the president of central council of jews in germany , took the opportunity to praise the project , but also criticized it for focusing on the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime .

under the monument , an information center provides visitors a personalized glimpse into one of the greatest crimes in history . after a long process and much debate , berlin will unveil on tuesday a central memorial to the holocaust .
covering an area of 19,000 square meters , the memorial comprises 2,711 grey pillars , or steles , of varying heights , from a few centimeters to 4.7 meters . they form a dense grid , which , according to the monument 's new york-based architect , peter eisenman , is supposed to create a sense of unease and loneliness among visitors who wander through it , reflecting the feelings of jews who were sent to concentration camps . bildunterschrift : aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe the monument , which has been under discussion for 17 years , has been both widely praised and roundly criticized .
its supporters say it is a courageous way for the germans to acknowledge in the very center of their capital city the darkest chapter of their history .
detractors have slammed the monument as an eyesore , a target for vandals and overly abstract . bringing it to earth but one part of the monument , which was initially opposed by eisenman , has been left alone by critics : the underground information center which documents the killing of six million jews by focusing on individual , personal stories .
even those who find the symbolism of the above-ground field of steles hard to comprehend will likely clearly understand the very concrete histories of deportation and destruction that are presented below . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior of the information center still under construction in january 2005 in the four exhibition rooms of the information center , the idea of the steles is maintained as a unifying theme .
cubes project down from the ceilings of the four rooms , appearing to be continuations of the concrete blocks on the surface . the first room contains six large-format portraits of victims of the mass-murder , representing the six million jews killed by the nazis .
one is of a boy from prague , zdenek konas , who was deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp at the age of 11 and later sent to auschwitz .
the last line in his short biography next to his picture is the word " lost . " the organizers wanted to pull the holocaust out of the realm of abstraction , a place it often resides since numbers like six million are hard for the human mind to fathom .
while the numbers of victims from different countries are listed on the walls , citations on glass surfaces elucidate the fates of individual people . one entry comes from the diary of herman kruk , written while he was in the vilnius ghetto : " what kind of life will it even be afterwards if i survive ?
what is the point of this whole pursuit of survival , enduring it all , hanging on ?
what is the point ? " lifting the anonymity according to dagmar von wilcken , one of the creators of the information center , the personalization of unimaginable suffering is one of the chief aims of the center .
it is the only way , she said , to lift the anonymity of the victims .
in the " room of names , " the names of individual victims are projected onto the walls while at the same time visitors can hear biographical details from the lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * file * * a visitor enters an exhibition hall displaying photographs and paintings inside a new wing of the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem sunday feb .

the inauguration of the new holocaust history museum at yad vashem , the memorial to the 6 million jewish victims of the nazis will take place tuesday march 15 .
-lrb- ap photo / oded balilty -rrb- * * zu unserem korr * * this was made possible through cooperative efforts with israel , which , for the first time , opened the databank at its yad vashem memorial -lrb- photo -rrb- , in which the names of holocaust victims have been gathered since 1954 .
still , the berlin memorial is also using new research techniques in order to get a more precise picture of the lives and deaths of many victims .
it will take years before all known names can be recorded in the information center .
at the opening , there will have been just 800 names registered . but the exhibition does not just concentrate on the dead .
in one room , a large selection of portraits of survivors will be on hand .
the information center , with the help of the furtunoff video archive from yale university , has been able to bring an extensive body of interview documents to berlin , some of which date from the end of the 1970s . with the help of the center 's computers , visitors can research their own personal family histories and students can listen to or read first-hand accounts of what happened during the " final solution .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain . in its guidelines to foreign doctors considering applying for junior positions in british hospitals , the uk academy of medical royal colleges warns against premature optimism .
" although the uk welcomes and will always welcome overseas graduates , levels of competition for junior posts are very high and applicants may spend long periods of time unemployed . "
the message is clear enough .
try it if you will , but expect nothing .
in the context of employment , this kind of communiqué would normally act as a de facto deterrent to germans , who infinitely prefer the security of the job-for-life scenario over the uncertainty of anything less .
but in the case of britain 's national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- , dissatisfied german doctors appear undaunted . german medics love the uk as of the start of this month , there were more doctors from germany on the british general medical council 's books than from any other european country .
although it is not clear how many are actually gainfully employed , 3,401 german doctors are registered to practice in the uk , compared with 2,281 from ireland , 2,053 from greece and just 565 from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is britain the medicine for sickened german doctors ?
it is evidence of an ongoing migratory trend from a country which , although experiencing relentlessly high rates of unemployment , can not lure enough home-grown doctors to fill its medical vacancies .
at the start of the german medical association congress last week , health minister ulla schmidt expressed sympathy for the modern medic .
" when i speak to young doctors , they tell me over and again that they want to work as a team .
they are not all leaving just for financial reasons , but also because of the flatter hierarchies and better working conditions abroad . "
dr. vincent everard jerome braganza is originally from england , but works as a head doctor in a small german hospital .
he 's been here for 25 years and understands only too well the gripes of young doctors in today 's work climate . the business of medical multitasking " doctors in germany are required to do a number of things they would not have to do in britain .
if a patient comes to a small hospital at night , it is the doctor who lets them in , takes their particulars and insurance details , fills out the x-ray forms , stitches any wounds , locks up the ambulance and so on .
the doctor is the porter , the secretary , and the nurse before he even starts being the doctor .
such misuse would never occur in that way in the uk , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : misuse is a word which comes up again and again among german doctors talking about their working conditions .
and it is not only remuneration - on average 25 percent lower than that offered by the nhs - but the structures on the hospital landscape which they collectively aggrieve .
after several years working for the nhs , dr. julia bartley returned to her native germany to work as a consultant at a hospital in berlin . with experience on both sides of the channel , she is in no doubt about the advantages of the british system . " firstly you get an excellent training in britain , but there are other issues such as the reduced hierarchy which means that when you have a good idea it does n't matter how high up you are , people listen and take you seriously , " bartley said .
she says it was largely the atmosphere in the hospital which made her want to leave germany when she did .
" young doctors are shouted at , reduced to tears and generally treated badly .
their superiors were put through the same thing and they see no problem in handing down what was dished out to them . "
spreading the load it might sound like an average rookie complaint , but braganza insists that the structures in german hospitals are more despotic than democratic .
while in the uk , there is an average of one consultant for every 20 hospital beds , in germany the departmental head can be in charge of more than 100 patients , delegating at will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in britain , the top level is more widely spread .
consultants are very independent and the system is fed sensibly .
but in germany , even the very senior doctors , who are specialists in their own right , have to kowtow to the head doctor , who can make life miserable for anyone he chooses , " braganza said . another factor which feeds into the equation is that germany has twice as many doctors per 100,000 patients as the uk . braganza sees that simple fact as a ticket to both bad behavior in the upper ranks of german hospitals and to slow career progress .
" in the uk , junior doctors are allowed to do many things because there are not as many doctors , whereas in germany only the top people get to perform , " he said . although the conditions in the uk seem enticing for young german graduates , braganza says there is no doubt that what they would really like is to see conditions at home improve , thus removing the need to work overseas . in her message to the nation 's doctors last week , ulla schmidt made it quite clear that she was open to suggestion . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

the latest report from the land registry reveals that property prices in merthyr tydfil have gone up 44 % compared to the same period last year .
blaenau gwent , was second at 30 % .
meanwhile , house prices in the vale of glamorgan went up by just 1 % between january and march this year .
the average welsh house price is over £ 133,000 .
the uk average is £ 183,486 .
across the uk , the average price increase was 10.27 % .
mick mcguire , director of business development at the principality building society , said house prices in wales had been driven by supply and demand .
he said : " demand for housing in south wales along the coastal belt was very high if you go back two or three years .
" as a result house prices rose very quickly in cardiff , newport , bridgend , and swansea but they have risen to such a level that they are now longer affordable for first time buyers .
first time buyers are bargain hunting further north in the valleys " because of that , first time buyers have had to go bargain hunting further north , looking up the valleys , initially towards places like pontypridd , and pontypool and treorchy .
" but now they are going even further north like merthyr tydfil and blaenau gwent .
" so what 's tending to happen is people are forced because of affordability to live further up the valleys at the heads of the valleys , and essentially commute to work in south wales . "
he said this northward migration of first time buyers was having a positive impact on the valleys communities .
he said : " what you find is an influx of working people who will improve the economy in the valleys region . "
new homes but despite the jump in prices , the volume of property sales has decreased compared with last year .
according to the report , nearly 160,000 people bought new homes between january and march this year , compared to nearly a quarter of a million last year .
last month , figures released by a property website suggested ferndale in the rhondda valleys was the cheapest town in england and wales with an average home costing £ 29,693 .
but local estate agents said a more realistic selling price for houses in the area was £ 60,000 .

the latest report from the land registry reveals that property prices in merthyr tydfil have gone up 44 % compared to the same period last year .
blaenau gwent , was second at 30 % .
meanwhile , house prices in the vale of glamorgan went up by just 1 % between january and march this year .

the uk average is £ 183,486 .
across the uk , the average price increase was 10.27 % .
mick mcguire , director of business development at the principality building society , said house prices in wales had been driven by supply and demand .
he said : " demand for housing in south wales along the coastal belt was very high if you go back two or three years .
" as a result house prices rose very quickly in cardiff , newport , bridgend , and swansea but they have risen to such a level that they are now longer affordable for first time buyers .
first time buyers are bargain hunting further north in the valleys " because of that , first time buyers have had to go bargain hunting further north , looking up the valleys , initially towards places like pontypridd , and pontypool and treorchy .
" but now they are going even further north like merthyr tydfil and blaenau gwent .
" so what 's tending to happen is people are forced because of affordability to live further up the valleys at the heads of the valleys , and essentially commute to work in south wales . "
he said this northward migration of first time buyers was having a positive impact on the valleys communities .
he said : " what you find is an influx of working people who will improve the economy in the valleys region . "

a bill to set up the zones was unveiled in parliament on monday .
projects in the zones will get tax concessions , and an efficient system for approving projects will be set up .
the cabinet has backed the plan , but it needs parliamentary approval as the zones will have a special taxation and bureaucratic structure .
investors would get 15 years tax relief for projects that take place inside the designated areas across the country .
many of the economic zones will have their own airports , ports and rail stations to ensure projects are not bogged down by poor infrastructure .
with india 's over-burdened legal system taking decades to clear cases , the government also plans to set up a single enforcement agency to ensure speedy investigation and trial of offences committed in the special economic zones .
policy makers believe special economic zones have played a significant role in china 's economic success and are hoping the formula will also help propel india 's economic growth .

a bill to set up the zones was unveiled in parliament on monday .
projects in the zones will get tax concessions , and an efficient system for approving projects will be set up .
the cabinet has backed the plan , but it needs parliamentary approval as the zones will have a special taxation and bureaucratic structure .
investors would get 15 years tax relief for projects that take place inside the designated areas across the country .
many of the economic zones will have their own airports , ports and rail stations to ensure projects are not bogged down by poor infrastructure .
with india 's over-burdened legal system taking decades to clear cases , the government also plans to set up a single enforcement agency to ensure speedy investigation and trial of offences committed in the special economic zones .
policy makers believe special economic zones have played a significant role in china 's economic success and are hoping the formula will also help propel india 's economic growth .

it is thought to be the leading cause of liver cancer .
the world health organization estimates that hepatitis b infections lead to more than one million deaths every year .
what causes hepatitis b ?
the disease is caused by the hepatitis b virus -lrb- hbv -rrb- that attacks the liver .
the virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids that contain blood .
this can occur through direct blood-to-blood contact , unprotected sex , and illicit drug use .
it can also be passed from an infected woman to her new-born during the delivery process .
does the virus always pose a health threat ?
it is thought that about one in three of the world 's population is infected by hbv .
however , about 50 % of those who carry the virus never develop any symptoms .
about nine out of ten people infected with hbv will eventually clear the virus from their bodies .
but about 5-10 % of infected adults will become chronic hepatitis b carriers , often without even knowing it .
what are the symptoms ?
the virus can cause a range of problems , including fever , fatigue , muscle or joint pain , loss of appetite , nausea and vomiting .
chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing liver disease such as cirrhosis or liver cancer , because the hepatitis b virus steadily attacks the liver .
chronic carriers will usually have on going inflammation of the liver and may eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer .
about 1 % of people who are infected develop an extreme form of disease called acute fulminant hepatitis .
this condition can be fatal if not treated quickly .
sufferers may collapse with fatigue , have yellowing of the skin and eyes -lrb- jaundice -rrb- and develop swelling in their abdomen .
how is it treated ?
there are several drug treatments available to treat hepatitis b. patients may be put on a four month course of injections of the drug interferon .
an alternative treatment is a drug called lamivudine which is taken orally once a day .
treatment is usually for one year .
sometimes lamivudine is combined with interferon .
chronic patients may require a liver transplant .
can it be prevented ?
yes , by the use of a safe and effective vaccine .
however , for the 400 million people world-wide who are already carriers of hbv , the vaccine is of no use .

it is thought to be the leading cause of liver cancer .
the world health organization estimates that hepatitis b infections lead to more than one million deaths every year .
what causes hepatitis b ?
the disease is caused by the hepatitis b virus -lrb- hbv -rrb- that attacks the liver .
the virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids that contain blood .
this can occur through direct blood-to-blood contact , unprotected sex , and illicit drug use .
it can also be passed from an infected woman to her new-born during the delivery process .
does the virus always pose a health threat ?
it is thought that about one in three of the world 's population is infected by hbv .
however , about 50 % of those who carry the virus never develop any symptoms .
about nine out of ten people infected with hbv will eventually clear the virus from their bodies .
but about 5-10 % of infected adults will become chronic hepatitis b carriers , often without even knowing it .
what are the symptoms ?
the virus can cause a range of problems , including fever , fatigue , muscle or joint pain , loss of appetite , nausea and vomiting .
chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing liver disease such as cirrhosis or liver cancer , because the hepatitis b virus steadily attacks the liver .
chronic carriers will usually have on going inflammation of the liver and may eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer .
about 1 % of people who are infected develop an extreme form of disease called acute fulminant hepatitis .
this condition can be fatal if not treated quickly .
sufferers may collapse with fatigue , have yellowing of the skin and eyes -lrb- jaundice -rrb- and develop swelling in their abdomen .
how is it treated ?
there are several drug treatments available to treat hepatitis b. patients may be put on a four month course of injections of the drug interferon .
an alternative treatment is a drug called lamivudine which is taken orally once a day .
treatment is usually for one year .
sometimes lamivudine is combined with interferon .
chronic patients may require a liver transplant .
can it be prevented ?
yes , by the use of a safe and effective vaccine .
however , for the 400 million people world-wide who are already carriers of hbv , the vaccine is of no use .

the test , developed by yale school of medicine , can pick up the disease before symptoms develop .
ovarian cancer has been called the " silent killer " because by the time symptoms become apparent it is often difficult to treat .
details are published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences . "
early diagnosis can help prolong or save lives , but clinicians currently have no sensitive screening method because the disease shows few symptoms " dr gil mor however , the test will require refinement before it is widely used , as , at this stage , it is only 95 % accurate .
just under 7,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the uk .
a large proportion - almost 4,700 - will die of the disease .
the new test relies on detecting four key proteins - leptin , prolactin , osteopontin , and insulin-like growth factor ii - associated with the disease .
looking for raised levels of these proteins led to ovarian cancer being identified with 95 % accuracy in a test group of more than 200 women .
single proteins each of the proteins had previously been suggested as a possible cancer biomarker .
but the yale researchers found that looking for each protein in isolation could not be relied upon to detect cancer .
lead researcher dr gil mor said the new test had the potential to be of great use .
he said : " early diagnosis can help prolong or save lives , but clinicians currently have no sensitive screening method because the disease shows few symptoms . "
however , the researchers accept their test needs further work , as even a 5 % failure rate could potentially lead to large numbers of women being misdiagnosed .
dr james mackay , a consultant clinical genetic oncologist with cancer research uk , said : " this is an interesting research finding .
" the next stage in investigating this would be to use these markers in a prospective study either of high-risk women or a randomised study of women at normal risk . "

more than 16,000 film professionals , including 3,600 journalists from about 80 countries are accredited for the festival every year .
cannes film festival where : cannes , cote d 'azur , france when : may top prize : palme d 'or history : the inaugural cannes film festival was held in september 1939 , but it was not held again until after world war ii .

maybe you would rather see leprechauns , or favour having the inner walls lined with old cds ?
if so , you are not alone - these are just some of the suggestions received by the woman who is hoping to light up the lives of the thousands of motorists who use the tunnel every day .
kathy friend took matters into her own hands after becoming fed up with the " grim " look of the link .
" that run of concrete and grey buildings is a rather depressing thing to greet you , " she said .
" i thought it would be improved a lot with lighting .
tunnel facts the clyde tunnel is the length of seven football pitches it cost £ 10.5m to build work started in july 1957 the construction involved a tunnel shield invented 139 years earlier by marc brunel the first tunnel opened in july 1963 , the second in march 1964 the tunnel is used by 65,000 vehicles every day it is 21ft below the surface of the river " i approached the city council and said there must be a lot of other people who have an idea of what they want it to look like .
" i pitched the idea of building a website and asking people what they thought . "
the project has grown rapidly to the stage where the partick resident , who works as a freelance lighting camerawoman , has had to set up a not-for-profit organisation to progress the plans .
the hold your breath website attracted 11,000 visitors in its first two months , and 2,000 people have filled in a questionnaire .
it asks them to choose what they would like to hear and smell as they pass through the tunnel , as well as their preferences for colours and shapes .
the poll has attracted a range of suggestions , with the only consensus so far being that it should be a relaxing journey accompanied by tuneful music .
mirror ball many people have suggested an underwater theme , while others favour a mural - something which has been ruled out for fears it would be too much of a distraction for drivers .
one contributor even suggested that there should be a mirror ball in the tunnel .
" we are hoping to do something quite funky , " said kathy .
i thought there would be a lot of apathy , but people are really interested and really keen kathy friend " we are quite keen to have changing patterns because some people use it every day . "
those travelling in the 65,000 vehicles who use the tunnel each day have been pointed in the website 's direction by a banner draped at the bridge 's entrance .
the hold your breath project took its name from a tradition which has been followed by generations of glasgow children .
for decades youngsters have been taking a deep breath as they enter the tunnel - and trying to hold it until they come out the other side .
travelling at the speed limit of 30mph , it should take 57 seconds to travel the tunnel 's 762m length .
kathy said there was no definitive explanation of where the tradition originated , although it was believed that children held their breath because they were going under water .
tune in youngsters have also been having their say on what the tunnel should look like by filling in the questionnaire and submitting their drawings - with many choosing an underwater theme .
pupils in local schools will also have an input into what people hear as they make the journey under the clyde .
the aim is to create a soundscape which drivers can tune into on their car radio .
an estimated 65,000 vehicles pass through the link each day the work will also involve musicians from the paragon ensemble , along with adult and youth groups in the surrounding area .
the two communities linked by the tunnel , linthouse and whiteinch , are classed as deprived areas .
funding has been secured to ask residents what they think could be done to improve the entrances at each end .
kathy admitted that she had been surprised at how the project had taken off .
" i thought there would be a lot of apathy , but people are really interested and really keen , " she said .
community consultation " i do n't know why they are so inspired by it .
i suppose that they see it as part of their heritage .
" it was quite an achievement at the time and they are enthusiastic about having something interesting and different happening . "
once the community consultation has been carried out a design team will look at the suggestions and then make its submissions to glasgow city council .
work is being carried out on the bridge 's lining the local authority has supported the project so far - but that does not guarantee that it will give the green light to the designs which are produced .
kathy estimated that it would cost about £ 400,000 to light the tunnel , depending on the final proposal .
three years ago the local authority launched a £ 2.6m lighting strategy , which includes the illumination of individual buildings and landmarks .
the council is currently undertaking a £ 9m project to replace the tunnel linings , due for completion in april next year .
kathy hopes that the lighting project could become a reality once that work is finished , hopefully in time for a proposed city of light festival in november next year .

net profits rose 0.8 % to 1.17 trillion yen -lrb- $ 11bn ; £ 5.85bn -rrb- , while sales were 7.3 % higher at 18.55 trillion yen .
the japanese firm is investing in new factories in the us and china in order to keep up with demand for trucks and saloon cars .
in 2005 , its consolidated vehicle sales increased to 7.4 million units .
right mix " toyota has the right products in most of the markets , " said norihito kanai , an analyst at meiji dresdner asset management in tokyo told bloomberg .
" that makes toyota successful in a difficult business environment of a stronger yen and higher steel prices . "
over the year to march , us vehicle sales rose 168,000 to 2.27 million , with the scion series and fuel efficient hybrid petrol-electric prius models helping to drive growth as consumers ditched " gas guzzling " vehicles like sports utility vehicles .
meanwhile , in asia it sold 362,000 more units taking total sales to 1.77 million - mainly as a result of strong sales of its larger innovative international multi-purpose vehicle .
however , many analysts say growing raw materials costs could affect future profits growth .
the company said in the coming year it expected to maintain a similar level of profit as in the just-reported year to the end of march 2005 .

mr blair has put the finishing touches to his government the appointment of unelected adviser andrew adonis to the department of education - and , as a result , the house of lords - and the rehabilitation of fallen ex-minister beverly hughes are signs of a prime minister attempting to prove just who is the boss .
and , just as with the cabinet changes , they underline his stated determination to finally get the job of reform of the public services done , presumably before he contemplates resignation .
he had already indicated his seriousness over pensions reform with david blunkett 's rehabilitation to work and pensions secretary .
there 's nothing that upsets backbenchers more than to see newcomers leaping straight on to the frontbench without paying their dues andrew adonis profile he has further underlined that with key new appointments to that department , specifically by bringing back popular peer lord hunt , who quit over the war .
his return could also be seen as a move towards reconciliation with some of his rebels .
but mr blair also put key figures in other posts - malcolm wicks will help examine the possibility of a difficult return to a nuclear energy policy , while ms hughes will be responsible for tackling the welfare of children .
the controversial appointment of mr adonis is another sign the prime minister intends to continue his radical reforms in schools - to the dismay of many on the backbenches .
top up fees and there is plenty of room elsewhere for controversy with the appointment of lord drayson , a major party donor , to the ministry of defence and former tory shaun woodward to northern ireland .
the moves may not be deliberately calculated to provoke his dissidents , but they will almost certainly have that effect anyway .
the most controversial appointments are undoubtedly those of mr adonis and ms hughes .
hughes worked with blunkett before resigning mr adonis is the architect of much of the prime minister 's existing education policies , particularly top up fees , and , for just that reason , is deeply distrusted by the left .
prime ministers often appoint favourites by making them peers , so avoiding the uncertainty of election .
but it is never a popular move and , at a time when mr blair is already facing criticisms , it will only add to the concerns .
even if , as suggested , this was a compromise after mr blair wanted to offer him a more senior post .
the appointment of ms hughes , a close friend of david blunkett who she served under in the home office , will also anger those who believe mr blair is too ready to forgive his friends of wrongdoing .
well balanced there have already been suggestions that mr blunkett 's re-appointment after the briefest of periods outside government flew in the face of mr blair 's pledge he had listened and learned during the bruising election campaign .
elsewhere , in a wide-ranging shuffle of the pack , mr blair promoted a sprinkling of both blairites and brownites , offering as pretty well balanced team as far as those two camps are concerned - little grist to the mill of those looking for a continuing turf war .
but there was nothing for any of the new intake such as gordon brown 's former aide and close friend ed balls .
they probably need - and may even have requested - time to bed down as simple mps first .
and there 's nothing that upsets backbenchers more than to see newcomers leaping straight on to the frontbench without paying their dues .
all this came as the prime minister faced demands for him to quit sooner rather than later by a number of mps .
mr blair 's allies have dismissed them as coming from " the usual suspects " and insist that he fully intends to serve a full third term , as he has pledged .
and this reshuffle , though possibly tempered to some degree by a desire not to unnecessarily provoke dissent , also seems designed to suggest a prime minister as firmly in control of his government as ever .
it is a difficult line to walk and only time will tell if mr blair has succeeded in treading it .
