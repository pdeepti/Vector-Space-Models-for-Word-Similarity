program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 .

" the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " rice said in an interview with fox news .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she said . the negotiations over iran 's suspected nuclear ambitions have been a major issue throughout rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first trip since becoming chief us diplomat last month .
she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
washington has so far supported the three eu countries ' diplomatic efforts , which have focused on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc . getting tougher bildunterschrift : rice and french foreign minister barnier in paris " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she said the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . " they need to hear that the discussions that they 're in with the europeans are not going to be a kind of way-station where they are allowed to continue their activities , that there 's going to be an end to this and that they 're going to end up in the security council , " rice said . her remarks come a day after rice flew to paris , a hotbed of opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq , proclaiming a " new chapter " had been opened in transatlantic relations strained for two years by divisions over the war . at the same time , french foreign minister michel barnier said the europeans needed more support from the united states if they were to persuade tehran to renounce its suspected attempts to develop a nuclear bomb .
" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .
and that 's what the message is that we conveyed to condi rice , " barnier said . no direct talks but rice shrugged off a suggestion that washington and tehran have direct talks to resolve the nuclear issue .
" everybody knows what the iranians need to do , " she told reporters in paris .
" they just need to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is preparing the way for us president bush to visit europe later in the month at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva tuesday , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . rice flew into brussels wednesday for a working lunch with her nato counterparts and talks with european union officials before heading off for luxembourg , the last stop on her tour of eight european nations . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice calls for " new chapter " in transatlantic ties condoleezza rice used a speech in paris on tuesday to begin mending bridges with the french government and to urge europe to " stand ready " to work with the us .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .

meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .

her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .

" the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " rice said in an interview with fox news .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she said . the negotiations over iran 's suspected nuclear ambitions have been a major issue throughout rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first trip since becoming chief us diplomat last month .
she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
washington has so far supported the three eu countries ' diplomatic efforts , which have focused on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc . getting tougher bildunterschrift : rice and french foreign minister barnier in paris " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she said the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . " they need to hear that the discussions that they 're in with the europeans are not going to be a kind of way-station where they are allowed to continue their activities , that there 's going to be an end to this and that they 're going to end up in the security council , " rice said . her remarks come a day after rice flew to paris , a hotbed of opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq , proclaiming a " new chapter " had been opened in transatlantic relations strained for two years by divisions over the war . at the same time , french foreign minister michel barnier said the europeans needed more support from the united states if they were to persuade tehran to renounce its suspected attempts to develop a nuclear bomb .
" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .
and that 's what the message is that we conveyed to condi rice , " barnier said . no direct talks but rice shrugged off a suggestion that washington and tehran have direct talks to resolve the nuclear issue .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .

such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes . "
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes . "
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .
" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .
15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .

lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .

" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .
and that 's what the message is that we conveyed to condi rice , " barnier said . no direct talks but rice shrugged off a suggestion that washington and tehran have direct talks to resolve the nuclear issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes . "
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .
" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .
15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations .

but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .

" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations .

but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .

meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .

" it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .

the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 .

" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .

but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one .

the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .

" influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .

while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .
" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .
15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes . "
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 -pipe- 10:00 utc secret lifted around göring 's suicide a former us army private who was a guard at the nuremberg trials has said he gave convicted nazi war criminal hermann goering the poison capsule that enabled him to commit suicide two hours before his scheduled execution . entire books have been written pondering how the heavily guarded nazi leader managed to evade justice .
while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .
" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .
15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .

denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .

lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 .

it works .

"
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .
" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .
15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

" i would have never knowingly taken something in that i thought was going to be used to help someone cheat the gallows , " he said .
two weeks after the delivery , on oct .

an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .

" the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " rice said in an interview with fox news .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she said . the negotiations over iran 's suspected nuclear ambitions have been a major issue throughout rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first trip since becoming chief us diplomat last month .
she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
washington has so far supported the three eu countries ' diplomatic efforts , which have focused on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc . getting tougher bildunterschrift : rice and french foreign minister barnier in paris " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she said the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . " they need to hear that the discussions that they 're in with the europeans are not going to be a kind of way-station where they are allowed to continue their activities , that there 's going to be an end to this and that they 're going to end up in the security council , " rice said . her remarks come a day after rice flew to paris , a hotbed of opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq , proclaiming a " new chapter " had been opened in transatlantic relations strained for two years by divisions over the war . at the same time , french foreign minister michel barnier said the europeans needed more support from the united states if they were to persuade tehran to renounce its suspected attempts to develop a nuclear bomb .
" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .
and that 's what the message is that we conveyed to condi rice , " barnier said . no direct talks but rice shrugged off a suggestion that washington and tehran have direct talks to resolve the nuclear issue .
" everybody knows what the iranians need to do , " she told reporters in paris .
" they just need to do it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is preparing the way for us president bush to visit europe later in the month at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva tuesday , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . rice flew into brussels wednesday for a working lunch with her nato counterparts and talks with european union officials before heading off for luxembourg , the last stop on her tour of eight european nations . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice calls for " new chapter " in transatlantic ties condoleezza rice used a speech in paris on tuesday to begin mending bridges with the french government and to urge europe to " stand ready " to work with the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.02.2005 danes reelect center-right government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's backers cheered his coalition 's win danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's center-right coalition government retained power in tuesday 's general election following a campaign dominated by its economic policies and restrictive immigration rules . " it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes . "
" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !
anders ! "
" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .

the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...

" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.02.2005 confusion as rice backtracks in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " have we been tough enough on iran or have n't we ? "
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

" it is a strengthened government that today can continue its work , " rasmussen told ecstatic supporters in copenhagen as they waved blue liberal party flags and chanted " anders !

" it is one thing to be elected , but it is another thing , and a very difficult thing , to be re-elected , " he boasted to reporters . less than an hour earlier , mogens lykketoft , head of the main opposition social democrats , conceded defeat in the country 's general election . " it 's a very unreasonable and unfair result and it pains me that we have to deal with the center-right government , supported by the dpp , for another four years , " lykketoft said , adding that he planned to resign as head of the social democratic party , which suffered its worst election defeat since 1973 . with all votes counted , election authorities said rasmussen 's liberal party , coalition conservatives and far-right danish people 's party -lrb- dpp -rrb- would have 95 of the 179 seats in the new parliament .
the three parties , which held 94 seats in the outgoing parliament , needed 90 seats to be assured of a majority . liberals remain strongest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders fogh rasmussen : still holding his breath before the final tally was announced the count allotted 80 parliamentary seats to denmark 's four left-leaning opposition parties , the social democrats , the radical party , the socialist people 's party and the unity list , who held 77 seats in the outgoing parliament .
the social democrats , who dominated denmark 's political scene for most of last century , lost five seats in the election , dropping to 47 parliamentary seats . the liberal party meanwhile saw its number of seats reduced by four , to 52 , but it remains denmark 's largest party . the results mirror opinion polls over recent weeks that suggested that denmark 's healthy economy along with a freeze on taxes would help secure another term for the coalition .
denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 . " this is the immigration policy we will continue conducting ...
it works .
we have no immediate plans of changing it , " rasmussen told reporters after declaring victory . increased racism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters in copenhagen this is bad news for denmark 's immigrant population , which is already complaining of increased racism and hostility towards " non-danes .

" the whole climate is more hostile due to the government and the dpp 's anti-immigrant rhetoric .
there 's no doubt people say things today that they would have been criticized for 10 years ago , " bibi amina , a 26-year-old law student of pakistani origin but born in denmark , said after voting in one of copenhagen 's largest immigrant neighborhoods , noerrebro . almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches eight percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included . one issue largely absent from the campaign was the government 's controversial decision to participate in the us-led iraq war , something a clear majority of danes are opposed to .
" the leftist parties ... tried to bring this issue center stage in the campaign ... but the media did n't follow , " political scientist hans joergen nielsen said . after polling stations closed on tuesday , voting authorities estimated that 84.4 percent of denmark 's approximately 4 million eligible voters had cast their ballot , down from the 87.1 percent who voted in the last general elections in 2001 elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de danes set to re-elect center-right as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .

denmark 's immigration policy , perhaps the most restrictive in europe , is also believed to have drawn many voters to rasmussen . influenced by the dpp , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination the scandinavian country 's immigration restrictions could tighten further after the dpp won two additional seats in tuesday 's election , boosting its parliamentary strength to 24 .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .

but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations .

"
after chiding europe for not being assertive with iran , condoleezza rice backtracked at nato hq in brussels wednesday saying the iranians had been reminded in no uncertain terms of their international responsibilities . us secretary of state condoleeza rice on wednesday urged european negotiators to take a tough line with iran , warning tehran of sanctions if it refuses to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons program . " i think a diplomatic solution is in our grasp if we have unity of message and unity of purpose , " rice told a news conference after meeting with her nato counterparts .
her remarks followed a day of confusion over washington 's policy on iran , after the top us diplomat gave an interview with fox news television in which she apparently scolded the europeans for their handling of negotiations . the talks , being led by britain , france and germany , have been a key issue during rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first foreign trip since being confirmed in her post last month . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " she said in the fox news interview .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she added . eu ponders mixed messages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , left , and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer address the media at nato headquarters in brussels , wednesday , feb .
9 , 2005 .
but at nato headquarters she appeared to back off somewhat and would not be drawn on an ultimatum , although she reiterated that washington was monitoring the proceedings closely .
" i believe everybody is telling the iranians that they are going to have to live up to their international obligations or next steps are in the offing , " she told the press conference . " we 've set no deadline , no timeline , " she said , when asked how long the us administration would let talks continue before pushing for other action .
" the iranians know what they need to do , " she added .
" the iranians have to be held to their international obligations .
we have n't set any timetables .
we continue to be completely in close consultation with the europeans , about how it is going , about whether progress is being made . " iran should take european chance , says rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
rice urged the iranians to " take the opportunity that the europeans are giving them to live up to these obligations , " and added " the message is there . " " the iranians need to get that message .
we can certainly always remind them that there are other steps that the international community has at its disposal should they not be prepared to live up to those obligations . " the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy programme and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
but while washington wants to take the case to the un security council , the europeans have favoured seeking to resolve the issue through talks . at their latest round of talks with iran in geneva , according to diplomats , britain , france and germany warned the country about activities that verge on breaches of its deal to freeze nuclear fuel cycle work . the united states has so far supported the diplomatic efforts , which have focussed on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc .
but the us line has been one seemingly headed for the un security council since day one . " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she added the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . iranians accuse us of sabotage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hasan rowhani .
meanwhile , rice 's remarks in the interview prompted hassan rohani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , to accuse the united states of trying to derail negotiations between tehran and europe 's ' big three ' .
" if it was n't for america 's pressures , iran and the european countries would have definitely reached an agreement in the next few weeks , " the official irna news agency quoted rohani as saying . " all of america 's efforts aim at the failure of iran 's agreements with the european countries .
such agreements are expensive for the united states , " he added .
" the europeans are definitely under the influence of the united states and say that if iran has enrichment we do n't know what it will do in the future , " rohani said . " we want to solve this issue through agreements , " rohani added .
" but if we do not reach an agreement , iran will automatically start enrichment .

while herbert lee stivers 's story can not be proven , several experts on the era have said it rings true .
stivers , 78 , a retired sheet metal worker from hesperia , southern california , was a 19-year-old army private assigned to a guard that escorted nazi defendants in and out of the courtroom during the post-world war ii war crimes trials .
stivers said he agreed to take " medicine " to a supposedly ailing göring to impress a flirtatious local girl who approached him one day on the street .

15 , 1946 , göring committed suicide and left a note bragging that he 'd had a cyanide pill during his entire 11-month war crimes trial .
an army investigation agreed and concluded the nazi had hidden the pill on his body and in his cell .
stivers said nothing for 60 years , fearing he could face charges , until his daughter convinced him to go public to ease his conscience and reveal his part in history .
the statute of limitations has long since run out , so he can not be prosecuted . dw-world.de " goering 's atlas " published for the first time the re-appearance of a secret atlas seized by us troops from luftwaffe chief hermann goering in the waning days of the war shows just what the nazis were capable of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.02.2005 rice chides europe over iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- with nato 's de hoop scheffer -rrb- : no timeline on iran a day after heralding a new era in transatlantic relations , us secretary of state condoleezza rice scolded her european allies wednesday over their handling of nuclear talks with iran . rice complained that britain , france and germany had failed to make sufficiently clear the threat of un sanctions if tehran refused to renounce its suspected nuclear weapons ambitions . " the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " rice said in an interview with fox news .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she said . the negotiations over iran 's suspected nuclear ambitions have been a major issue throughout rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first trip since becoming chief us diplomat last month .
she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
washington has so far supported the three eu countries ' diplomatic efforts , which have focused on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc . getting tougher bildunterschrift : rice and french foreign minister barnier in paris " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .
she said the united states had believed all along the iranians should be referred to the un security council for alleged violations of international non-proliferation norms . " they need to hear that the discussions that they 're in with the europeans are not going to be a kind of way-station where they are allowed to continue their activities , that there 's going to be an end to this and that they 're going to end up in the security council , " rice said . her remarks come a day after rice flew to paris , a hotbed of opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq , proclaiming a " new chapter " had been opened in transatlantic relations strained for two years by divisions over the war . at the same time , french foreign minister michel barnier said the europeans needed more support from the united states if they were to persuade tehran to renounce its suspected attempts to develop a nuclear bomb .
" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .

" the iranians need to hear that if they are unwilling to take the deal , really , that the europeans are giving ... then the security council referral looms , " rice said in an interview with fox news .
" i do n't know that anyone has said that as clearly as they should to the iranians , " she said . the negotiations over iran 's suspected nuclear ambitions have been a major issue throughout rice 's week-long tour of europe and the middle east , her first trip since becoming chief us diplomat last month .
she did say washington has " no deadline " for progress in diplomatic efforts to secure guarantees from iran over its suspected nuclear arms program . the united states accuses iran of trying to obtain nuclear weapons under cover of developing a civilian atomic energy program , and has not excluded a military option against tehran .
washington has so far supported the three eu countries ' diplomatic efforts , which have focused on getting iran to promise not to make the bomb in return for trade privileges with the 25-nation bloc . getting tougher bildunterschrift : rice and french foreign minister barnier in paris " the international community has got to be certain to speak with one very tough voice to the iranians that it is not going to be acceptable for iran to build a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power , " rice told fox .

" they need to hear that the discussions that they 're in with the europeans are not going to be a kind of way-station where they are allowed to continue their activities , that there 's going to be an end to this and that they 're going to end up in the security council , " rice said . her remarks come a day after rice flew to paris , a hotbed of opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq , proclaiming a " new chapter " had been opened in transatlantic relations strained for two years by divisions over the war . at the same time , french foreign minister michel barnier said the europeans needed more support from the united states if they were to persuade tehran to renounce its suspected attempts to develop a nuclear bomb .
" we need the confidence and the support of the united states in this very delicate phase we are in .
and that 's what the message is that we conveyed to condi rice , " barnier said . no direct talks but rice shrugged off a suggestion that washington and tehran have direct talks to resolve the nuclear issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc kohl : no need to panic over neo-nazi party former chancellor helmut kohl said on tuesday there was no need to panic over germany 's small neo-nazi party and it would be pointless to ban the group .
speaking to a group of foreign journalists , the retired german leader expressed his concerns about german-american relations . " i 'm not going to lose my head over a few right-wing radicals , " he answered when asked about the government 's attempt to ban the far-right national democratic party that was blocked by the constitutional court .
" it 's annoying when neo-nazis are on the march as they are in saxony , " he said , referring to the npd winning 9.2 percent in an election in saxony state .
" i 'm ashamed .
it 's bad for germany because the annihilation of millions of jews was conceived here .
but germany is a healthy country .
it 's not at all endangered by neo-nazis . "
kohl contended that a ban would be pointless as it would result in the party coming back at another level . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc kohl : no need to panic over neo-nazi party former chancellor helmut kohl said on tuesday there was no need to panic over germany 's small neo-nazi party and it would be pointless to ban the group .
speaking to a group of foreign journalists , the retired german leader expressed his concerns about german-american relations . " i 'm not going to lose my head over a few right-wing radicals , " he answered when asked about the government 's attempt to ban the far-right national democratic party that was blocked by the constitutional court .
" it 's annoying when neo-nazis are on the march as they are in saxony , " he said , referring to the npd winning 9.2 percent in an election in saxony state .
" i 'm ashamed .
it 's bad for germany because the annihilation of millions of jews was conceived here .
but germany is a healthy country .
it 's not at all endangered by neo-nazis . "
kohl contended that a ban would be pointless as it would result in the party coming back at another level . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close .

" it 's annoying when neo-nazis are on the march as they are in saxony , " he said , referring to the npd winning 9.2 percent in an election in saxony state .
" i 'm ashamed .
it 's bad for germany because the annihilation of millions of jews was conceived here .
but germany is a healthy country .
it 's not at all endangered by neo-nazis . "
kohl contended that a ban would be pointless as it would result in the party coming back at another level . dw-world.de high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

" i see an irresponsible deutsche bank boss who behaves as if he could just make demands of society and politicians , as if he did n't have to be a good citizen too , " bütikofer said on german public broadcaster ard . hesse state social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- head andrea ypsilanti on tuesday called on deutsche bank customers to boycott the financial institute . " every deutsche bank customer can assess whether he does n't do more for jobs in germany if he switches to a state-owned savings bank or cooperative bank , " ypsilanti said . " influenced by carnival " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf-ernst breuer deutsche bank supervisory board head rolf-ernst breuer -lrb- photo -rrb- defended swiss ceo ackermann 's decision to slash jobs , attributing the politicians ' calls for customers to leave the bank to " carnival , " which ended wednesday .
company managers routinely faced criticism in germany , breuer said . " that 's part of the business , " he said .
" that 's how the supervisory board sees it too .
we fully support what mr. ackermann does . "
german reactions to the bank 's decisions were sometimes " downright esoteric , " he added . last week , ackermann announced that net profits had increased by 87 percent , to € 2.55 billion -lrb- $ 3.26 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
ackermann said the bank still aimed to achieve an additional 25 percent growth in returns .
a day later , he said 6,400 jobs would be cut , while around 1,200 new positions would be created , mainly in countries where incomes are low .
around 2,300 of the lay-offs will hit employees in germany .
bundesbank director edgar meister defended the plans to cut jobs on wednesday and called for the discussion to be quickly brought to a close . " it should n't be frowned upon if individual banks aim for profits that allow them to again join the international league , " financial times deutschland quoted him as saying . risk to more jobs ? ypsilanti 's boycott call has received backing from top spd politician andrea nahles and the leader of the spd 's youth organization , björn böhning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank headquarters in frankfurt but other spd and green party leaders rejected the idea .
the head of parliament 's financial committee , christiane scheel , said a boycott would only hurt the bank 's employees .
the green party politician said though that the job cuts were " immoral . "
spd economics expert rainer wend said the call to boycott was " more of an expression of helplessness than a sensible political action . " the christian democratic party in hesse said ypsilanti 's demand was " intellectually thin and economically disastrous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.02.2005 eu opposes european ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , nazi symbols can -lrb- almost only -rrb- be shown in museums a europe-wide ban on nazi symbols seems unlikely as eu officials are increasingly opposed to such a move . wine bottles inscribed with nazi symbols and soccer players that use the ' hitler ' greeting could become part of everyday life in europe because of increasing opposition in brussels to an eu-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols . on tuesday , eu justice minister franco frattini outraged german members of parliament by issuing a surprisingly candid rebuff : such a measure would be " stupid , " he said . the collapse of the initiative occurred mostly due to the italian and british opposition to the measure : they say it hinders freedom of expression . the issue exploded after british prince harry attended a costume party wearing a nazi uniform shortly before the 60th anniversary of the freeing of the prisoners at auschwitz concentration camp last month .
outraged , german members of the eu parliament pushed for a europe-wide ban .
so far , only germany and austria have such a ban . nazi costume sets off furor while prince harry can hide behind an apology and the thick walls of windsor castle , in germany , he would be threatened with up to a three-year jail sentence : pictures of hitler , the ss symbol and the hitler ' greeting ' are forbidden .
the only exceptions are for historical or news purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a need to remember and respect , supporters of the ban say the rules are much laxer in other european countries .
the north italian winzer wine is distributed with pictures of prominent nazis such as hitler or heinrich himmler and remains unthreatened by the courts despite containing the words " sieg heil " on its label .
lazio rom soccer star paolo di canio flashed a fascist greeting to his rivals in january , without the worry of a fine or jail time . " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz " german justice minister brigitte zypries wants to see an europe-wide ban on such symbols .
so does german eu parliament member silvana koch mehrin , who is upset by such displays and who was one of the first to speak in favor of a ban . " after all , -lrb- nazi symbols -rrb- refers to a regime that systematically murdered millions of people , " she said .
" a ban of symbols that stand for such a despised ideology can assist in making sure they will not be frivolously abused . " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden makes similar arguments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current nazi crime " we have to remember the victims of auschwitz and remain vigilant against the ideology that allowed the death camp to be created , " he said . but opponents say an europe-wide ban is " unnecessary , " according to a spokesman for the british representatives to the eu . meanwhile , frattini hopes that each of the member states proceeds against the right-leaning symbols in their own manner .
that may be difficult in italy , at least in the foreseeable future .
the far-right alleanza nationale is part of the governing coalition of silvio berlusconi , in which frattini served as foreign minister until last fall . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

the land reform act was passed two years ago but only came into effect on wednesday , legally underpinning access rights across scotland .
it guarantees a statutory right of responsible access to land and inland waters for recreation , crossing and for educational and commercial purposes .
it supporters hope it will end disputes over rights of way in conjunction with the new scottish outdoor access code .
the code provides guidance on responsible behaviour for recreational users , and on the responsible management of land , in relation to public access , by farmers and other land managers .
the days of landowners claiming that theirs is a private kingdom should be at an end .
ramblers ' association scotland it will be the duty of local authorities to make sure the code is being complied with .
they will also have to keep open and free from obstruction any route subject to access .
a media advertising campaign publicising the new code is also due to begin .
the new legislation also gives certain rural communities first refusal when land is put up for sale and even stronger rights to crofters to compulsorily purchase their land from the owner .
scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- carried out its biggest consultation ever in seeking views on the draft code holding more than 50 public meetings and sending out 20,000 copies of the document to interested organisations .
snh chairman john markland said scotland now had some of the " most progressive access legislation in europe " .
lewis macdonald urged people to take advantage of the changes he said : " the plea we make to scotland 's people is to ' know the code before you go ' . "
deputy environment and rural development minister lewis macdonald urged communities and individuals to " think creatively " to turn the new rights into economic opportunities and secure environmental benefits .
he said : " for the first time in scotland 's history , we now have a clear and explicit right of responsible access to our countryside .
" our land and landscape are not there only for the exclusive use of a few .
they are there for the whole community to enjoy .
" it is important that communities and individuals think creatively to turn these new rights of access into new economic opportunities while securing environmental benefits . "
the ramblers association urged councils and other public bodies to provide the funding to pay for pathways and match the ambition of the new laws .
investment need the association 's director in scotland dave morris said : " the days of landowners claiming that theirs is a private kingdom should be at an end .
" we must ensure local authorities and other funding bodies in charge of forestry and agriculture , for example , make the necessary investment to provide more walking and cycling routes , particularly around communities where people live and work . "
access legislation elsewhere in the uk differs .
in england , defra and the countryside agency are responsible for implementing the countryside and rights of way act 2000 .
the new right of access is being introduced regionally on a rolling programme , a process which started on 19 september 2004 and is due to be completed by the end of 2005 .
the new right enables " open access " , which means that people will be able to wander freely across " access land " and will not have to stick to paths .

the land reform act was passed two years ago but only came into effect on wednesday , legally underpinning access rights across scotland .
it guarantees a statutory right of responsible access to land and inland waters for recreation , crossing and for educational and commercial purposes .
it supporters hope it will end disputes over rights of way in conjunction with the new scottish outdoor access code .
the code provides guidance on responsible behaviour for recreational users , and on the responsible management of land , in relation to public access , by farmers and other land managers .
the days of landowners claiming that theirs is a private kingdom should be at an end .
ramblers ' association scotland it will be the duty of local authorities to make sure the code is being complied with .
they will also have to keep open and free from obstruction any route subject to access .
a media advertising campaign publicising the new code is also due to begin .
the new legislation also gives certain rural communities first refusal when land is put up for sale and even stronger rights to crofters to compulsorily purchase their land from the owner .
scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- carried out its biggest consultation ever in seeking views on the draft code holding more than 50 public meetings and sending out 20,000 copies of the document to interested organisations .
snh chairman john markland said scotland now had some of the " most progressive access legislation in europe " .
lewis macdonald urged people to take advantage of the changes he said : " the plea we make to scotland 's people is to ' know the code before you go ' . "
deputy environment and rural development minister lewis macdonald urged communities and individuals to " think creatively " to turn the new rights into economic opportunities and secure environmental benefits .
he said : " for the first time in scotland 's history , we now have a clear and explicit right of responsible access to our countryside .
" our land and landscape are not there only for the exclusive use of a few .
they are there for the whole community to enjoy .
" it is important that communities and individuals think creatively to turn these new rights of access into new economic opportunities while securing environmental benefits . "
the ramblers association urged councils and other public bodies to provide the funding to pay for pathways and match the ambition of the new laws .
investment need the association 's director in scotland dave morris said : " the days of landowners claiming that theirs is a private kingdom should be at an end .
" we must ensure local authorities and other funding bodies in charge of forestry and agriculture , for example , make the necessary investment to provide more walking and cycling routes , particularly around communities where people live and work . "
access legislation elsewhere in the uk differs .
in england , defra and the countryside agency are responsible for implementing the countryside and rights of way act 2000 .
the new right of access is being introduced regionally on a rolling programme , a process which started on 19 september 2004 and is due to be completed by the end of 2005 .
the new right enables " open access " , which means that people will be able to wander freely across " access land " and will not have to stick to paths .

the company reported net profits up 6.9 % in the three months to december to 134.2bn yen -lrb- $ 1.27bn ; £ 685m -rrb- .
nissan was the fastest-growing major carmaker in the us in 2004 , selling 24 % more vehicles than the previous year .
its success comes as larger rival toyota is shaking up its management to sustain its own solid performance - and as us rivals struggle to boost sales .
toyota said on wednesday that it was moving executive vice-president katsuaki watanabe , a production and corporate planning expert , up to become president .
he will replace fujio cho , during whose tenure toyota became the world 's number two carmaker by sales and who becomes vice chairman .
current chairman hiroshi okuda remains in place .
asian growth nissan 's us sales were almost 1 million vehicles last year .
us giants ford and gm sold many more cars , as did the us arm of daimlerchrysler - but ford and gm both lost ground while their asian rivals accelerated .
on a global scale , toyota is expected to match gm 's sales of almost 9 million units next year .
in comparison , nissan president carlos ghosn has forecast sales of 3.6 million units in the year to september - up a million units from 2001 .
nissan is 44 % owned by france 's renault .

peter bolton , 51 , from abergele , was suspended in july 2004 following claims that he had leaked confidential documents to the media .
but he was cleared of misconduct in public office when the case against him collapsed at chester crown court .
the authority said the suspension would continue while it held its own inquiry .
members of the north wales police authority spent nearly five hours in private on tuesday discussing whether mr bolton could go back to work .
the meeting was attended by chief constable richard brunstrom , who had been criticised for not stopping the original leak inquiry .
in a statement , the police authority said mr bolton 's suspension should go on pending the outcome of the investigation being run by the authority itself .
this investigation will look again at the events of the last year , since the leak itself , and the inquiry which led to mr bolton being charged .
it has been estimated that the court case last month against mr bolton , an ex-chief superintendent , cost up to £ 200,000 .
bullying allegations mr bolton had always denied the charge of wilful misconduct in a public office .
it had been alleged he had sent a confidential report on bullying allegations against deputy chief constable bill brereton to a news agency .
the document alleged that mr brereton , now retired after 30 years service , had bullied female members of staff within the force .
mr bolton had been a chief superintendent with the north wales force before he became assistant clerk to the police authority .
his solicitor said after the court case that the previous 12 months had been a " nightmare " for mr bolton and his family .

sania mirza 's serve wo n't win any awards for design and her toss is so high you can have a cigarette waiting for it to come down .
she is a few biryanis -lrb- flavoured rice -rrb- heavier that an elite athlete can afford to be and her acceleration on court is more ford than ferrari .
but no big deal ; this you can teach an 18-year-old .
what you ca n't is chutzpah , and toughness , and sania mirza has both .
though when i first saw her , it was hard to believe .
for a while at the australian open , and only that , sania mirza froze .
you could see it in her awkwardness when matches began , as if the enormity of the moment had short-circuited her brain , as if nerves had locked her elbow and anxiety shackled her feet .
so everyone feels suffocated under pressure , everyone chokes .
even australian open champion marat safin , he said so himself .
bolder generation mirza , who was turned away by her first coach when six , was now playing in the main draw of a grand slam singles for the first time ; a teenager out of hyderabad was rubbing shoulders with a muscular , glittering serena williams .
hell , a choke made sense .
when the next indian girl prepares for her second round tennis match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i your views on this column indian athletes anyway , at least in the past , were known to go a little weak-kneed when confronted by an alien environment .
raised amid inadequate facilities , poorly travelled , physically out-matched , assisted by inferior coaches , awe followed them on a leash .
but this is a bolder generation , more likely to shrug off the cloak of intimidation , and it is somewhat apparent in virender sehwag 's audacity , in irfan pathan 's cool debut in australia , in anju george 's resolve in the long jump arena .
these athletes , and they are a growing tribe , believe they belong .
it 's not something learnt from a coach or found in a textbook , but a self-belief that swirls in an individual athletes ' mind .
and it is what mirza has .
quite simply , mirza thawed at the australian open after the odd hesitant set , she folded her nerves as she does her spectacles , put them aside and embraced the moment .
she let her forehand sing , and her small fist pump , and her mouth grimace ; there was a sense she enjoyed this metallic taste of battle and could do with some more .
' confidence is the key ' her body language was n't rude but it was clear : bring it on .
it is no coincidence that when i asked mahesh bhupathi , whose company globosport manages mirza , what strikes him most about his charge , he said : " her confidence is the key and her belief in herself will take her a long way . "
nirupama vaidyanathan , once the highest-ranked women 's player -lrb- no.134 -rrb- prior to mirza -lrb- now no.131 -rrb- , was his echo : " she believed in herself even before the results arrived .
some people may call it cockiness , but it 's very essential in international tennis . "
sania lost to serena williams in the third round mirza is going to need that nerve , because even though she 's just entered a new world , india expects the world of her .
there has been much celebration of her at home , and while some of it has been overdone , it is also understandable .
sporting success is not a familiar friend , and praise accumulates and is then heaped on any sudden achievement .
mirza has done well to replicate quickly what leander paes did just once in his grand slam singles career -lrb- a third round placing -rrb- , yet she remains an apprentice .
it was blurted out in india that she has top 10 potential , and irrespective of whether it is an exaggeration , it is an unnecessary burden for a player only finding her tennis feet .
the fact is she hits a powerful ball , but to watch maria sharapova 's ferocious duel with serena , and lindsay davenport exchange body blows with alicia molik , is to be quickly educated on the distance mirza has yet to go .
we need to keep our perspective , and she hers .
cosmic lottery the fact is mirza has journeyed remarkably from somewhere in the 400s last year to no.131 , yet each small journey up the rankings becomes increasingly harder .
as vaidyanathan says : " no one -lrb- in india -rrb- has any clue as to the amount of hard work it actually takes to get even to top 100 . "
leander paes -lrb- left -rrb- is among indian tennis stars the process will be slow , but expectation will hound mirza , not only by virtue of her performance , but because of her unique position .
through the years , more through some cosmic lottery than design , india has found a player of international standing every generation .
from ramanathan krishan , to jaideep mukerjee and premjit lall , to the amritraj brothers , to ramesh krishanan , to leander paes , the cycle has continued .
then , post-paes , who arrived in the early 1990s , it seemed to stop .
where was the next player ?
she was there , except we were looking in the wrong draw .
the highest ranked indian , male or female , mirza has sponsors , she has a specialist adviser bob brett -lrb- once boris becker 's coach -rrb- , she has the experience of bhupathi to lean on .
once she gets a travelling coach , a priority , the pieces will be in place .
then she will need her chutzpah .
breaking barriers but irrespective of where mirza ends up , she has forged a path .
vaidyanathan was the first indian woman to get to the second round of a grand slam .
now mirza is the first to get to the third .
both women , in their small , distinctive ways have broken barriers , their wins investing future generations with a certain courage .
after all , when the next indian girl prepares for her second round match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i. here is a selection if your comments on rohit brijnath 's article way to go sania .
she has not only shown positive results but her way of playing shows definite potential for the future .
i hope to see her ranked in the top ten sometime soon .
sajjad haider , pakistan i think the article is interesting most because tells about a girl who is doing a great job rigth now ...
i like it ! congrats sania ! ! !
god bless you and good luck !
noelia , perú i wish sania all the best .
however i do n't feel she has the tools to trouble the top 25 players in the world .
her greatest achievements could come off the court , as she could inspire the next generation of players .
with a proper system in place , it could take another 10-15 years before indian players in the top 100 are common place .
suraj , uk let sania win a major title .
then i will accept her to be genuine .
so much of hype -lrb- just for facing serena and losing to her -rrb- is only going to weigh her down .
anybody can face serena in the first round and lose .
let her play .
media please settle down .
the hype created by u guys is greater than the hype created for hingis .
sanjay mupparapu , usa for a country and culture that does not value athletics , miss mirza has done extremely well .
fida awadia , canada as a native hyderabadi , i 'm especially overjoyed by the emergence of a new sports star from my city which has produced two of the most elegant batsmen ever ... md azharuddin and v v s laxman .
though what sania has achieved is tremendous , there is still a lot for the young pro to look forward to and strive for .
she seems to have the right temperament but she needs to work on her movement and her serve if she is to break into the elite top 20 .
arobind velagapudi , san diego , usa it requires guts to play at centre court of any grand slam for the first time whether it is an indian girl or any other country .
though another girl of indian origin playing in her first grand slam at flushing meadows , new york against another williams sister , shikha uberoi in her very first set gave a tough fight to venus but then ran out of gas in second set .
rohit is right , what sania needs is to have mental toughness while playing big matches. spmalik , usa sania mirza certainly has the natural talent & power for the top 20 - as her second set display against serena in australia proved , but her future achievements will largely depend on her ability to handle the expectation of a nation .
not sure about the writers comment about her weight though , she looked pretty good to me .
good luck !
ben stevens , uk hey , i think that media is spoiling her career .
she just made to the third round and she has a long way to go .
but the article is wonderful and should encourage the new talent .
the parents should also learn from sania 's parents and realise that there is also something else called sports not only eduation which will earn you money anand kumar , united states it was a real pleasure to watch serena play sania , both wore yellow and the fashion designer could take lessons in the simple , clean cut appearance of sania 's outfit .
sania 's tennis was enjoyable too ! , but congratulations to serena for winning .
michael rowe , canada yes , sania could do wonders .
i wish her all the best !
rajesh v r , kerala , india the story on sania by brijnath is very interesting and inspiring story .
she is a real hero .
brijnath has covered many factors responsible in the rise of sania , and also the people who stood by her .
rajendra , india good to see that in population of over a billion , india is actually coming up with a few who accomplished right to the top in many different sports .
other asian countries must also realise the need to encourage the upbringing of talents which are concealed by so many off-putting factors and take these young players as an inspiration .
imran khan , united kingdom a lot has being written about mirza .
she is no doubt talented and has made india proud .
but i am afraid the media will now spoil her .
please leave her alone and let her win a title .
buroshiva dasgupta , india this hype about sania mirza is just that : hype .
for heaven sake , all she did was reach the second round .
plus there is even a bit of political correctness and pseudo secularism displayed by indian media .
after all , she is a muslim and indian media celebrating her no end is their way off showing off their ' secular ' credentials .
she is just a flash in the pan .
ram , usa well done , mr brijnath !
an apt article offering an unbiased point of view .
it is indeed heartening to see india 's recognition and success at sports other than cricket .
sania mirza has definitely made an impression with her performance at the australian open .
and like the writer mentions , she has what it takes to get better .
my only concern is the publicity and hype that has been generated by the indian media , and the effect that this might have on the young woman .
not to take anything away from sania , but all one has to notice is a competitor like maria sharapova , and sania fades in comparison .
sania will do well not to be swept away by all the adulation she is getting back home .
this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .
yes it is great to say that the women of south asia are also coming on the top of the world , specially in tennis which is very not familiar in that region .
altaf hussain , australia our hearts swelled with pride to see fellow indian reach the 3rd round of a grand slam .
she will go far .
basu srinivasan , usa i have watched her game when she played against williams .
sania has got some short swing forehand , but she definitely needs great work on her serve .
i am not sure if she can be in top 10 , but she should break into top 50 in next 12 months .
she -lrb- sania -rrb- also has to work on her fitness , movement on court and her physique .
she looked a bit chubby , but as writer mentioned she can probably has to work on it and that too quickly .
i am a great tennis fan , i would definitely want to see more and more indians break into international tennis and do respectably well .
i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .
my best wishes to her and to all the new hopefuls .
jay antani , usa a good and timely column .
the opening paragraphs have an overdose of some funky metaphors , a little heavy for a dunce like me !

i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .
my best wishes to her and to all the new hopefuls .

sania mirza 's serve wo n't win any awards for design and her toss is so high you can have a cigarette waiting for it to come down .
she is a few biryanis -lrb- flavoured rice -rrb- heavier that an elite athlete can afford to be and her acceleration on court is more ford than ferrari .
but no big deal ; this you can teach an 18-year-old .
what you ca n't is chutzpah , and toughness , and sania mirza has both .
though when i first saw her , it was hard to believe .
for a while at the australian open , and only that , sania mirza froze .
you could see it in her awkwardness when matches began , as if the enormity of the moment had short-circuited her brain , as if nerves had locked her elbow and anxiety shackled her feet .
so everyone feels suffocated under pressure , everyone chokes .
even australian open champion marat safin , he said so himself .
bolder generation mirza , who was turned away by her first coach when six , was now playing in the main draw of a grand slam singles for the first time ; a teenager out of hyderabad was rubbing shoulders with a muscular , glittering serena williams .
hell , a choke made sense .
when the next indian girl prepares for her second round tennis match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i your views on this column indian athletes anyway , at least in the past , were known to go a little weak-kneed when confronted by an alien environment .
raised amid inadequate facilities , poorly travelled , physically out-matched , assisted by inferior coaches , awe followed them on a leash .
but this is a bolder generation , more likely to shrug off the cloak of intimidation , and it is somewhat apparent in virender sehwag 's audacity , in irfan pathan 's cool debut in australia , in anju george 's resolve in the long jump arena .
these athletes , and they are a growing tribe , believe they belong .
it 's not something learnt from a coach or found in a textbook , but a self-belief that swirls in an individual athletes ' mind .
and it is what mirza has .
quite simply , mirza thawed at the australian open after the odd hesitant set , she folded her nerves as she does her spectacles , put them aside and embraced the moment .
she let her forehand sing , and her small fist pump , and her mouth grimace ; there was a sense she enjoyed this metallic taste of battle and could do with some more .
' confidence is the key ' her body language was n't rude but it was clear : bring it on .
it is no coincidence that when i asked mahesh bhupathi , whose company globosport manages mirza , what strikes him most about his charge , he said : " her confidence is the key and her belief in herself will take her a long way . "
nirupama vaidyanathan , once the highest-ranked women 's player -lrb- no.134 -rrb- prior to mirza -lrb- now no.131 -rrb- , was his echo : " she believed in herself even before the results arrived .
some people may call it cockiness , but it 's very essential in international tennis . "
sania lost to serena williams in the third round mirza is going to need that nerve , because even though she 's just entered a new world , india expects the world of her .
there has been much celebration of her at home , and while some of it has been overdone , it is also understandable .
sporting success is not a familiar friend , and praise accumulates and is then heaped on any sudden achievement .
mirza has done well to replicate quickly what leander paes did just once in his grand slam singles career -lrb- a third round placing -rrb- , yet she remains an apprentice .
it was blurted out in india that she has top 10 potential , and irrespective of whether it is an exaggeration , it is an unnecessary burden for a player only finding her tennis feet .
the fact is she hits a powerful ball , but to watch maria sharapova 's ferocious duel with serena , and lindsay davenport exchange body blows with alicia molik , is to be quickly educated on the distance mirza has yet to go .
we need to keep our perspective , and she hers .
cosmic lottery the fact is mirza has journeyed remarkably from somewhere in the 400s last year to no.131 , yet each small journey up the rankings becomes increasingly harder .
as vaidyanathan says : " no one -lrb- in india -rrb- has any clue as to the amount of hard work it actually takes to get even to top 100 . "
leander paes -lrb- left -rrb- is among indian tennis stars the process will be slow , but expectation will hound mirza , not only by virtue of her performance , but because of her unique position .
through the years , more through some cosmic lottery than design , india has found a player of international standing every generation .
from ramanathan krishan , to jaideep mukerjee and premjit lall , to the amritraj brothers , to ramesh krishanan , to leander paes , the cycle has continued .
then , post-paes , who arrived in the early 1990s , it seemed to stop .
where was the next player ?
she was there , except we were looking in the wrong draw .
the highest ranked indian , male or female , mirza has sponsors , she has a specialist adviser bob brett -lrb- once boris becker 's coach -rrb- , she has the experience of bhupathi to lean on .
once she gets a travelling coach , a priority , the pieces will be in place .
then she will need her chutzpah .
breaking barriers but irrespective of where mirza ends up , she has forged a path .
vaidyanathan was the first indian woman to get to the second round of a grand slam .
now mirza is the first to get to the third .
both women , in their small , distinctive ways have broken barriers , their wins investing future generations with a certain courage .
after all , when the next indian girl prepares for her second round match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i. here is a selection if your comments on rohit brijnath 's article way to go sania .
she has not only shown positive results but her way of playing shows definite potential for the future .
i hope to see her ranked in the top ten sometime soon .
sajjad haider , pakistan i think the article is interesting most because tells about a girl who is doing a great job rigth now ...
i like it ! congrats sania ! ! !
god bless you and good luck !
noelia , perú i wish sania all the best .
however i do n't feel she has the tools to trouble the top 25 players in the world .
her greatest achievements could come off the court , as she could inspire the next generation of players .
with a proper system in place , it could take another 10-15 years before indian players in the top 100 are common place .
suraj , uk let sania win a major title .
then i will accept her to be genuine .
so much of hype -lrb- just for facing serena and losing to her -rrb- is only going to weigh her down .
anybody can face serena in the first round and lose .
let her play .
media please settle down .
the hype created by u guys is greater than the hype created for hingis .
sanjay mupparapu , usa for a country and culture that does not value athletics , miss mirza has done extremely well .
fida awadia , canada as a native hyderabadi , i 'm especially overjoyed by the emergence of a new sports star from my city which has produced two of the most elegant batsmen ever ... md azharuddin and v v s laxman .
though what sania has achieved is tremendous , there is still a lot for the young pro to look forward to and strive for .
she seems to have the right temperament but she needs to work on her movement and her serve if she is to break into the elite top 20 .
arobind velagapudi , san diego , usa it requires guts to play at centre court of any grand slam for the first time whether it is an indian girl or any other country .
though another girl of indian origin playing in her first grand slam at flushing meadows , new york against another williams sister , shikha uberoi in her very first set gave a tough fight to venus but then ran out of gas in second set .
rohit is right , what sania needs is to have mental toughness while playing big matches. spmalik , usa sania mirza certainly has the natural talent & power for the top 20 - as her second set display against serena in australia proved , but her future achievements will largely depend on her ability to handle the expectation of a nation .
not sure about the writers comment about her weight though , she looked pretty good to me .
good luck !
ben stevens , uk hey , i think that media is spoiling her career .
she just made to the third round and she has a long way to go .
but the article is wonderful and should encourage the new talent .
the parents should also learn from sania 's parents and realise that there is also something else called sports not only eduation which will earn you money anand kumar , united states it was a real pleasure to watch serena play sania , both wore yellow and the fashion designer could take lessons in the simple , clean cut appearance of sania 's outfit .
sania 's tennis was enjoyable too ! , but congratulations to serena for winning .
michael rowe , canada yes , sania could do wonders .
i wish her all the best !
rajesh v r , kerala , india the story on sania by brijnath is very interesting and inspiring story .
she is a real hero .
brijnath has covered many factors responsible in the rise of sania , and also the people who stood by her .
rajendra , india good to see that in population of over a billion , india is actually coming up with a few who accomplished right to the top in many different sports .
other asian countries must also realise the need to encourage the upbringing of talents which are concealed by so many off-putting factors and take these young players as an inspiration .
imran khan , united kingdom a lot has being written about mirza .
she is no doubt talented and has made india proud .
but i am afraid the media will now spoil her .
please leave her alone and let her win a title .
buroshiva dasgupta , india this hype about sania mirza is just that : hype .
for heaven sake , all she did was reach the second round .
plus there is even a bit of political correctness and pseudo secularism displayed by indian media .
after all , she is a muslim and indian media celebrating her no end is their way off showing off their ' secular ' credentials .
she is just a flash in the pan .
ram , usa well done , mr brijnath !
an apt article offering an unbiased point of view .
it is indeed heartening to see india 's recognition and success at sports other than cricket .
sania mirza has definitely made an impression with her performance at the australian open .
and like the writer mentions , she has what it takes to get better .
my only concern is the publicity and hype that has been generated by the indian media , and the effect that this might have on the young woman .
not to take anything away from sania , but all one has to notice is a competitor like maria sharapova , and sania fades in comparison .
sania will do well not to be swept away by all the adulation she is getting back home .
this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .
yes it is great to say that the women of south asia are also coming on the top of the world , specially in tennis which is very not familiar in that region .
altaf hussain , australia our hearts swelled with pride to see fellow indian reach the 3rd round of a grand slam .
she will go far .
basu srinivasan , usa i have watched her game when she played against williams .
sania has got some short swing forehand , but she definitely needs great work on her serve .
i am not sure if she can be in top 10 , but she should break into top 50 in next 12 months .
she -lrb- sania -rrb- also has to work on her fitness , movement on court and her physique .
she looked a bit chubby , but as writer mentioned she can probably has to work on it and that too quickly .
i am a great tennis fan , i would definitely want to see more and more indians break into international tennis and do respectably well .
i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .
my best wishes to her and to all the new hopefuls .

this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .
yes it is great to say that the women of south asia are also coming on the top of the world , specially in tennis which is very not familiar in that region .
altaf hussain , australia our hearts swelled with pride to see fellow indian reach the 3rd round of a grand slam .
she will go far .
basu srinivasan , usa i have watched her game when she played against williams .
sania has got some short swing forehand , but she definitely needs great work on her serve .
i am not sure if she can be in top 10 , but she should break into top 50 in next 12 months .
she -lrb- sania -rrb- also has to work on her fitness , movement on court and her physique .
she looked a bit chubby , but as writer mentioned she can probably has to work on it and that too quickly .
i am a great tennis fan , i would definitely want to see more and more indians break into international tennis and do respectably well .
i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .
my best wishes to her and to all the new hopefuls .
jay antani , usa a good and timely column .

sania mirza 's serve wo n't win any awards for design and her toss is so high you can have a cigarette waiting for it to come down .
she is a few biryanis -lrb- flavoured rice -rrb- heavier that an elite athlete can afford to be and her acceleration on court is more ford than ferrari .
but no big deal ; this you can teach an 18-year-old .
what you ca n't is chutzpah , and toughness , and sania mirza has both .
though when i first saw her , it was hard to believe .
for a while at the australian open , and only that , sania mirza froze .
you could see it in her awkwardness when matches began , as if the enormity of the moment had short-circuited her brain , as if nerves had locked her elbow and anxiety shackled her feet .
so everyone feels suffocated under pressure , everyone chokes .
even australian open champion marat safin , he said so himself .
bolder generation mirza , who was turned away by her first coach when six , was now playing in the main draw of a grand slam singles for the first time ; a teenager out of hyderabad was rubbing shoulders with a muscular , glittering serena williams .
hell , a choke made sense .
when the next indian girl prepares for her second round tennis match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i your views on this column indian athletes anyway , at least in the past , were known to go a little weak-kneed when confronted by an alien environment .
raised amid inadequate facilities , poorly travelled , physically out-matched , assisted by inferior coaches , awe followed them on a leash .
but this is a bolder generation , more likely to shrug off the cloak of intimidation , and it is somewhat apparent in virender sehwag 's audacity , in irfan pathan 's cool debut in australia , in anju george 's resolve in the long jump arena .
these athletes , and they are a growing tribe , believe they belong .
it 's not something learnt from a coach or found in a textbook , but a self-belief that swirls in an individual athletes ' mind .
and it is what mirza has .
quite simply , mirza thawed at the australian open after the odd hesitant set , she folded her nerves as she does her spectacles , put them aside and embraced the moment .
she let her forehand sing , and her small fist pump , and her mouth grimace ; there was a sense she enjoyed this metallic taste of battle and could do with some more .
' confidence is the key ' her body language was n't rude but it was clear : bring it on .
it is no coincidence that when i asked mahesh bhupathi , whose company globosport manages mirza , what strikes him most about his charge , he said : " her confidence is the key and her belief in herself will take her a long way . "
nirupama vaidyanathan , once the highest-ranked women 's player -lrb- no.134 -rrb- prior to mirza -lrb- now no.131 -rrb- , was his echo : " she believed in herself even before the results arrived .
some people may call it cockiness , but it 's very essential in international tennis . "
sania lost to serena williams in the third round mirza is going to need that nerve , because even though she 's just entered a new world , india expects the world of her .
there has been much celebration of her at home , and while some of it has been overdone , it is also understandable .
sporting success is not a familiar friend , and praise accumulates and is then heaped on any sudden achievement .
mirza has done well to replicate quickly what leander paes did just once in his grand slam singles career -lrb- a third round placing -rrb- , yet she remains an apprentice .
it was blurted out in india that she has top 10 potential , and irrespective of whether it is an exaggeration , it is an unnecessary burden for a player only finding her tennis feet .
the fact is she hits a powerful ball , but to watch maria sharapova 's ferocious duel with serena , and lindsay davenport exchange body blows with alicia molik , is to be quickly educated on the distance mirza has yet to go .
we need to keep our perspective , and she hers .
cosmic lottery the fact is mirza has journeyed remarkably from somewhere in the 400s last year to no.131 , yet each small journey up the rankings becomes increasingly harder .
as vaidyanathan says : " no one -lrb- in india -rrb- has any clue as to the amount of hard work it actually takes to get even to top 100 . "
leander paes -lrb- left -rrb- is among indian tennis stars the process will be slow , but expectation will hound mirza , not only by virtue of her performance , but because of her unique position .
through the years , more through some cosmic lottery than design , india has found a player of international standing every generation .
from ramanathan krishan , to jaideep mukerjee and premjit lall , to the amritraj brothers , to ramesh krishanan , to leander paes , the cycle has continued .
then , post-paes , who arrived in the early 1990s , it seemed to stop .
where was the next player ?
she was there , except we were looking in the wrong draw .
the highest ranked indian , male or female , mirza has sponsors , she has a specialist adviser bob brett -lrb- once boris becker 's coach -rrb- , she has the experience of bhupathi to lean on .
once she gets a travelling coach , a priority , the pieces will be in place .
then she will need her chutzpah .
breaking barriers but irrespective of where mirza ends up , she has forged a path .
vaidyanathan was the first indian woman to get to the second round of a grand slam .
now mirza is the first to get to the third .
both women , in their small , distinctive ways have broken barriers , their wins investing future generations with a certain courage .
after all , when the next indian girl prepares for her second round match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i. here is a selection if your comments on rohit brijnath 's article way to go sania .
she has not only shown positive results but her way of playing shows definite potential for the future .
i hope to see her ranked in the top ten sometime soon .
sajjad haider , pakistan i think the article is interesting most because tells about a girl who is doing a great job rigth now ...
i like it ! congrats sania ! ! !
god bless you and good luck !
noelia , perú i wish sania all the best .
however i do n't feel she has the tools to trouble the top 25 players in the world .
her greatest achievements could come off the court , as she could inspire the next generation of players .
with a proper system in place , it could take another 10-15 years before indian players in the top 100 are common place .
suraj , uk let sania win a major title .
then i will accept her to be genuine .
so much of hype -lrb- just for facing serena and losing to her -rrb- is only going to weigh her down .
anybody can face serena in the first round and lose .
let her play .
media please settle down .
the hype created by u guys is greater than the hype created for hingis .
sanjay mupparapu , usa for a country and culture that does not value athletics , miss mirza has done extremely well .
fida awadia , canada as a native hyderabadi , i 'm especially overjoyed by the emergence of a new sports star from my city which has produced two of the most elegant batsmen ever ... md azharuddin and v v s laxman .
though what sania has achieved is tremendous , there is still a lot for the young pro to look forward to and strive for .
she seems to have the right temperament but she needs to work on her movement and her serve if she is to break into the elite top 20 .
arobind velagapudi , san diego , usa it requires guts to play at centre court of any grand slam for the first time whether it is an indian girl or any other country .
though another girl of indian origin playing in her first grand slam at flushing meadows , new york against another williams sister , shikha uberoi in her very first set gave a tough fight to venus but then ran out of gas in second set .
rohit is right , what sania needs is to have mental toughness while playing big matches. spmalik , usa sania mirza certainly has the natural talent & power for the top 20 - as her second set display against serena in australia proved , but her future achievements will largely depend on her ability to handle the expectation of a nation .
not sure about the writers comment about her weight though , she looked pretty good to me .
good luck !
ben stevens , uk hey , i think that media is spoiling her career .
she just made to the third round and she has a long way to go .
but the article is wonderful and should encourage the new talent .
the parents should also learn from sania 's parents and realise that there is also something else called sports not only eduation which will earn you money anand kumar , united states it was a real pleasure to watch serena play sania , both wore yellow and the fashion designer could take lessons in the simple , clean cut appearance of sania 's outfit .
sania 's tennis was enjoyable too ! , but congratulations to serena for winning .
michael rowe , canada yes , sania could do wonders .
i wish her all the best !
rajesh v r , kerala , india the story on sania by brijnath is very interesting and inspiring story .
she is a real hero .
brijnath has covered many factors responsible in the rise of sania , and also the people who stood by her .
rajendra , india good to see that in population of over a billion , india is actually coming up with a few who accomplished right to the top in many different sports .
other asian countries must also realise the need to encourage the upbringing of talents which are concealed by so many off-putting factors and take these young players as an inspiration .
imran khan , united kingdom a lot has being written about mirza .
she is no doubt talented and has made india proud .
but i am afraid the media will now spoil her .
please leave her alone and let her win a title .
buroshiva dasgupta , india this hype about sania mirza is just that : hype .
for heaven sake , all she did was reach the second round .
plus there is even a bit of political correctness and pseudo secularism displayed by indian media .
after all , she is a muslim and indian media celebrating her no end is their way off showing off their ' secular ' credentials .
she is just a flash in the pan .
ram , usa well done , mr brijnath !
an apt article offering an unbiased point of view .
it is indeed heartening to see india 's recognition and success at sports other than cricket .
sania mirza has definitely made an impression with her performance at the australian open .
and like the writer mentions , she has what it takes to get better .
my only concern is the publicity and hype that has been generated by the indian media , and the effect that this might have on the young woman .
not to take anything away from sania , but all one has to notice is a competitor like maria sharapova , and sania fades in comparison .
sania will do well not to be swept away by all the adulation she is getting back home .
this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .
yes it is great to say that the women of south asia are also coming on the top of the world , specially in tennis which is very not familiar in that region .
altaf hussain , australia our hearts swelled with pride to see fellow indian reach the 3rd round of a grand slam .
she will go far .
basu srinivasan , usa i have watched her game when she played against williams .

i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .

sania 's tennis was enjoyable too ! , but congratulations to serena for winning .
michael rowe , canada yes , sania could do wonders .
i wish her all the best !
rajesh v r , kerala , india the story on sania by brijnath is very interesting and inspiring story .
she is a real hero .
brijnath has covered many factors responsible in the rise of sania , and also the people who stood by her .
rajendra , india good to see that in population of over a billion , india is actually coming up with a few who accomplished right to the top in many different sports .
other asian countries must also realise the need to encourage the upbringing of talents which are concealed by so many off-putting factors and take these young players as an inspiration .
imran khan , united kingdom a lot has being written about mirza .
she is no doubt talented and has made india proud .
but i am afraid the media will now spoil her .
please leave her alone and let her win a title .
buroshiva dasgupta , india this hype about sania mirza is just that : hype .
for heaven sake , all she did was reach the second round .
plus there is even a bit of political correctness and pseudo secularism displayed by indian media .
after all , she is a muslim and indian media celebrating her no end is their way off showing off their ' secular ' credentials .
she is just a flash in the pan .
ram , usa well done , mr brijnath !
an apt article offering an unbiased point of view .
it is indeed heartening to see india 's recognition and success at sports other than cricket .
sania mirza has definitely made an impression with her performance at the australian open .
and like the writer mentions , she has what it takes to get better .
my only concern is the publicity and hype that has been generated by the indian media , and the effect that this might have on the young woman .
not to take anything away from sania , but all one has to notice is a competitor like maria sharapova , and sania fades in comparison .
sania will do well not to be swept away by all the adulation she is getting back home .
this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .
yes it is great to say that the women of south asia are also coming on the top of the world , specially in tennis which is very not familiar in that region .
altaf hussain , australia our hearts swelled with pride to see fellow indian reach the 3rd round of a grand slam .
she will go far .
basu srinivasan , usa i have watched her game when she played against williams .
sania has got some short swing forehand , but she definitely needs great work on her serve .
i am not sure if she can be in top 10 , but she should break into top 50 in next 12 months .
she -lrb- sania -rrb- also has to work on her fitness , movement on court and her physique .
she looked a bit chubby , but as writer mentioned she can probably has to work on it and that too quickly .
i am a great tennis fan , i would definitely want to see more and more indians break into international tennis and do respectably well .
i do not have high expectations on sania as i do not want to put pressure ; but for now she has to win some matches and reach quarters / semis in some tournaments in circuit .
good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.
best of luck to her .
dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .
its her confidence and hard work which can prove herself and make us proud .
i hope if she play with the same enthusiasm the day is not too far when we can see her playing final at the next grand slam ehtesham , uk a wonderfully written article .
let 's hope that the media wo n't derail mirza or any of the atheletic stars of the new generation with overinflated hype .
let 's hope that the people around mirza give her the balance , perspective and confidence she 'll need to go far and achieve her fullest potential .
my best wishes to her and to all the new hopefuls .

sania mirza 's serve wo n't win any awards for design and her toss is so high you can have a cigarette waiting for it to come down .
she is a few biryanis -lrb- flavoured rice -rrb- heavier that an elite athlete can afford to be and her acceleration on court is more ford than ferrari .
but no big deal ; this you can teach an 18-year-old .
what you ca n't is chutzpah , and toughness , and sania mirza has both .
though when i first saw her , it was hard to believe .
for a while at the australian open , and only that , sania mirza froze .
you could see it in her awkwardness when matches began , as if the enormity of the moment had short-circuited her brain , as if nerves had locked her elbow and anxiety shackled her feet .
so everyone feels suffocated under pressure , everyone chokes .
even australian open champion marat safin , he said so himself .
bolder generation mirza , who was turned away by her first coach when six , was now playing in the main draw of a grand slam singles for the first time ; a teenager out of hyderabad was rubbing shoulders with a muscular , glittering serena williams .
hell , a choke made sense .
when the next indian girl prepares for her second round tennis match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i your views on this column indian athletes anyway , at least in the past , were known to go a little weak-kneed when confronted by an alien environment .
raised amid inadequate facilities , poorly travelled , physically out-matched , assisted by inferior coaches , awe followed them on a leash .
but this is a bolder generation , more likely to shrug off the cloak of intimidation , and it is somewhat apparent in virender sehwag 's audacity , in irfan pathan 's cool debut in australia , in anju george 's resolve in the long jump arena .
these athletes , and they are a growing tribe , believe they belong .
it 's not something learnt from a coach or found in a textbook , but a self-belief that swirls in an individual athletes ' mind .
and it is what mirza has .
quite simply , mirza thawed at the australian open after the odd hesitant set , she folded her nerves as she does her spectacles , put them aside and embraced the moment .
she let her forehand sing , and her small fist pump , and her mouth grimace ; there was a sense she enjoyed this metallic taste of battle and could do with some more .
' confidence is the key ' her body language was n't rude but it was clear : bring it on .
it is no coincidence that when i asked mahesh bhupathi , whose company globosport manages mirza , what strikes him most about his charge , he said : " her confidence is the key and her belief in herself will take her a long way . "
nirupama vaidyanathan , once the highest-ranked women 's player -lrb- no.134 -rrb- prior to mirza -lrb- now no.131 -rrb- , was his echo : " she believed in herself even before the results arrived .
some people may call it cockiness , but it 's very essential in international tennis . "
sania lost to serena williams in the third round mirza is going to need that nerve , because even though she 's just entered a new world , india expects the world of her .
there has been much celebration of her at home , and while some of it has been overdone , it is also understandable .
sporting success is not a familiar friend , and praise accumulates and is then heaped on any sudden achievement .
mirza has done well to replicate quickly what leander paes did just once in his grand slam singles career -lrb- a third round placing -rrb- , yet she remains an apprentice .
it was blurted out in india that she has top 10 potential , and irrespective of whether it is an exaggeration , it is an unnecessary burden for a player only finding her tennis feet .
the fact is she hits a powerful ball , but to watch maria sharapova 's ferocious duel with serena , and lindsay davenport exchange body blows with alicia molik , is to be quickly educated on the distance mirza has yet to go .
we need to keep our perspective , and she hers .
cosmic lottery the fact is mirza has journeyed remarkably from somewhere in the 400s last year to no.131 , yet each small journey up the rankings becomes increasingly harder .
as vaidyanathan says : " no one -lrb- in india -rrb- has any clue as to the amount of hard work it actually takes to get even to top 100 . "
leander paes -lrb- left -rrb- is among indian tennis stars the process will be slow , but expectation will hound mirza , not only by virtue of her performance , but because of her unique position .
through the years , more through some cosmic lottery than design , india has found a player of international standing every generation .
from ramanathan krishan , to jaideep mukerjee and premjit lall , to the amritraj brothers , to ramesh krishanan , to leander paes , the cycle has continued .
then , post-paes , who arrived in the early 1990s , it seemed to stop .
where was the next player ?
she was there , except we were looking in the wrong draw .
the highest ranked indian , male or female , mirza has sponsors , she has a specialist adviser bob brett -lrb- once boris becker 's coach -rrb- , she has the experience of bhupathi to lean on .
once she gets a travelling coach , a priority , the pieces will be in place .
then she will need her chutzpah .
breaking barriers but irrespective of where mirza ends up , she has forged a path .
vaidyanathan was the first indian woman to get to the second round of a grand slam .
now mirza is the first to get to the third .
both women , in their small , distinctive ways have broken barriers , their wins investing future generations with a certain courage .
after all , when the next indian girl prepares for her second round match at a grand slam , you know what she 'll be thinking : hey , sania made it through , so can i. here is a selection if your comments on rohit brijnath 's article way to go sania .
she has not only shown positive results but her way of playing shows definite potential for the future .
i hope to see her ranked in the top ten sometime soon .
sajjad haider , pakistan i think the article is interesting most because tells about a girl who is doing a great job rigth now ...
i like it ! congrats sania ! ! !
god bless you and good luck !
noelia , perú i wish sania all the best .
however i do n't feel she has the tools to trouble the top 25 players in the world .
her greatest achievements could come off the court , as she could inspire the next generation of players .
with a proper system in place , it could take another 10-15 years before indian players in the top 100 are common place .
suraj , uk let sania win a major title .
then i will accept her to be genuine .
so much of hype -lrb- just for facing serena and losing to her -rrb- is only going to weigh her down .
anybody can face serena in the first round and lose .
let her play .
media please settle down .
the hype created by u guys is greater than the hype created for hingis .
sanjay mupparapu , usa for a country and culture that does not value athletics , miss mirza has done extremely well .
fida awadia , canada as a native hyderabadi , i 'm especially overjoyed by the emergence of a new sports star from my city which has produced two of the most elegant batsmen ever ... md azharuddin and v v s laxman .
though what sania has achieved is tremendous , there is still a lot for the young pro to look forward to and strive for .
she seems to have the right temperament but she needs to work on her movement and her serve if she is to break into the elite top 20 .
arobind velagapudi , san diego , usa it requires guts to play at centre court of any grand slam for the first time whether it is an indian girl or any other country .
though another girl of indian origin playing in her first grand slam at flushing meadows , new york against another williams sister , shikha uberoi in her very first set gave a tough fight to venus but then ran out of gas in second set .
rohit is right , what sania needs is to have mental toughness while playing big matches. spmalik , usa sania mirza certainly has the natural talent & power for the top 20 - as her second set display against serena in australia proved , but her future achievements will largely depend on her ability to handle the expectation of a nation .
not sure about the writers comment about her weight though , she looked pretty good to me .
good luck !
ben stevens , uk hey , i think that media is spoiling her career .
she just made to the third round and she has a long way to go .
but the article is wonderful and should encourage the new talent .
the parents should also learn from sania 's parents and realise that there is also something else called sports not only eduation which will earn you money anand kumar , united states it was a real pleasure to watch serena play sania , both wore yellow and the fashion designer could take lessons in the simple , clean cut appearance of sania 's outfit .
sania 's tennis was enjoyable too ! , but congratulations to serena for winning .
michael rowe , canada yes , sania could do wonders .
i wish her all the best !
rajesh v r , kerala , india the story on sania by brijnath is very interesting and inspiring story .
she is a real hero .
brijnath has covered many factors responsible in the rise of sania , and also the people who stood by her .
rajendra , india good to see that in population of over a billion , india is actually coming up with a few who accomplished right to the top in many different sports .
other asian countries must also realise the need to encourage the upbringing of talents which are concealed by so many off-putting factors and take these young players as an inspiration .
imran khan , united kingdom a lot has being written about mirza .
she is no doubt talented and has made india proud .
but i am afraid the media will now spoil her .
please leave her alone and let her win a title .
buroshiva dasgupta , india this hype about sania mirza is just that : hype .
for heaven sake , all she did was reach the second round .
plus there is even a bit of political correctness and pseudo secularism displayed by indian media .
after all , she is a muslim and indian media celebrating her no end is their way off showing off their ' secular ' credentials .
she is just a flash in the pan .
ram , usa well done , mr brijnath !
an apt article offering an unbiased point of view .
it is indeed heartening to see india 's recognition and success at sports other than cricket .
sania mirza has definitely made an impression with her performance at the australian open .
and like the writer mentions , she has what it takes to get better .
my only concern is the publicity and hype that has been generated by the indian media , and the effect that this might have on the young woman .
not to take anything away from sania , but all one has to notice is a competitor like maria sharapova , and sania fades in comparison .
sania will do well not to be swept away by all the adulation she is getting back home .
this is only the beginning ; sania needs to realise that public memory tends to be short and she will constantly need to raise the bar .
santosh kumar , usa it 's good to see an indian star shine .
i feel making it to the semi finals is something that can be praise worthy , not the third round .
anand , india rohit is pretty much on spot .
mere look of the photo of sania shaking hands with serena will show you the difference between a champion and the ones below 100 , as sania herself admitted in her comments .
now look back how was serena looking like at the age 18 .
the q i have is why sania has not already been trained to take care of her physique , the girth and a proper service style .
the right type of physical fitness has been the bane of indian athletes , be it in any form of sport .
-lrb- look what difference it made to the indian cricket team with top class professional help -rrb- .
hopefully sania will also improve as bajinath says .
but surely it was a somewhat disappointing to see sania a bit on plumpier side for her height .
surely the girl possesses immense grit as can be seen from the number of matches she has won in 3 setters and from the brink .
she definitely has the potential .
wish her well. tilak , currently in usa this is a nice column and it highlights the successes of sania mirza who really has done something which can be done by a very few women in indian subcontinent .

good luck to her .
srinivas , usa like many countries with only a few professional tennis players , there will be a great weight thrusted on her shoulders in expectation of winning in the future .
she seems to have the mental strength and sensible advisors to grow in her game rather than fold under the pressure .
it will take a great deal of hard physical and mental work to reach the heights of the game , but she can look upon the likes of martina hingis or justine henin-hardenne to show that sheer physical size or huge muscles are not a prerequisite to being no.1.

dr amit arora , london the article is excellent i think sania has done the great job for the country and specially for the city hyderabad where i belong .

more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags , which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses .
some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases .
the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low .
the survey of consumers in the uk , france , germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini .
the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology .
the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number .
product purchases more than half -lrb- 55 % -rrb- of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases .
fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties .
ard jan vetham , capgemini 's principal consultant on rfid , said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology .
" acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns .
" with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers , the industry can reach this point . "
he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items .
the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items .
they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands , in the uk .
mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed -lrb- 52 % -rrb- believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance .
he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology .
at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering -lrb- caspian -rrb- - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing .
all kinds of personal belongings , including clothes , could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners , it warned .

more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags , which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses .
some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases .
the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low .
the survey of consumers in the uk , france , germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini .
the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology .
the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number .
product purchases more than half -lrb- 55 % -rrb- of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases .
fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties .
ard jan vetham , capgemini 's principal consultant on rfid , said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology .
" acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns .
" with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers , the industry can reach this point . "
he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items .
the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items .
they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands , in the uk .
mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed -lrb- 52 % -rrb- believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance .

more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags , which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses .
some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases .
the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low .
the survey of consumers in the uk , france , germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini .
the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology .
the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number .
product purchases more than half -lrb- 55 % -rrb- of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases .
fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties .
ard jan vetham , capgemini 's principal consultant on rfid , said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology .
" acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns .
" with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers , the industry can reach this point . "
he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items .
the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items .
they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands , in the uk .
mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed -lrb- 52 % -rrb- believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance .
he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology .
at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering -lrb- caspian -rrb- - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing .
all kinds of personal belongings , including clothes , could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners , it warned .
