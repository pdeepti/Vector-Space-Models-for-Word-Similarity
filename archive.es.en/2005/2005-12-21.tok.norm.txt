but germany has called for imposing a " purity law " to protect european wines from us vintners ' practices . german agriculture minister horst seehofer said a new european union code is necessary to assure the quality of european wines .
us practices such as adding water to dilute the alcohol and ageing wine with woodchips to improve flavor are unacceptable in europe , he said . " it 's absolutely unclear why we bother having rules for the production and labeling of wine in europe if they are not applied to agreements with other countries , " he said . numerous european lawmakers have long accused the us industry of cheapening wine by using the new methods .
adding water and sugar to wine is permitted in the united states but not the eu , as are so-called designer wines , which are separated into their various components in laboratories before being rebuilt for a more consistent taste . but under the deal reached by eu and us negotiators , which only germany , austria and portugal opposed , the two sides will mutually recognize each other 's winemaking practices .
they will also open more detailed talks on protecting geographical indications and the status of low alcohol wines .
europea n culture or artificial product ?
faced with the new agreement , italy has asked for a change in eu law to allow the use of wood chips .
the eu has already allowed scientific testing but it is still banned commercially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu winemakers are more restricted than us producers the president of the association of german prädikat wine estates , michael prinz zu salm-salm , said he is hopeful it will stay that way . " we are wine growers , not winemakers , " he said .
" we take what nature gives us to carefully craft the best wines we can .
i 'm worried that customers wo n't be able to recognize whether they 're buying a part of european culture or an artificial product . " but many eu member states said they supported the 2.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- deal because it avoids burdensome certification procedures that might further slow sluggish sales outside of europe . they were also eager to see the us administration move on limiting the use of 17 european names on american wines such as burgundy , champagne and chianti that until now have been considered " semi-generic " in the united states . sam edmonds -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .
it is almost certain to resist this pressure . dw staff -lrb- jb , nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants un to censure iran over president 's remarks germany plans to ask the un security council to punish iran for remarks made by its president questioning the reality of the holocaust , a senior government official says in an interview to be published sunday .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .
the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann . " we will encourage him to stay , regardless of the personal hardship he would be put through -lrb- by a retrial -rrb- , " rolf breuer , the bank 's supervisory board chairman , told the ft . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss could be back in the dock germany 's highest court will decide wednesday whether to re-open the controversial mannesmann case - a decision that may see the head of germany 's largest bank , josef ackermann , in court again .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder .

the old agreement with premiere as the main pay-tv partner was worth 300 million euros .
the contract includes the introduction of a live friday night bundesliga game . cable consortium dwarfs premiere offer to secure rights reports that the german soccer league could expect to reap more than 400 million euros for the rights were proved to be correct as the cable consortium proved too powerful in the bidding stakes for the likes of premiere and german telecommunication giant deutsche telekom .
the dfl is set to pocket a staggering 1.26 billion euros from the rights in the three-year period . premiere , which had been seen as front-runner to secure the deal with an increased bid of more than 250 million euros , will continue to transmit live bundesliga matches during the rest of the current season . premiere also has the rights to show live all 64 matches of soccer 's 2006 world cup and in august bought the german rights to the uefa champions league soccer competition . " sportschau " retains prime slot despite pay-tv demands earlier this year , the pay-tv company demanded a bigger time gap between its live matches and ard 's " sportschau , " proposing that the free tv summary show be moved to a slot at 10 p.m.
the highlights show will now stay where it is in the schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere shares crashed on the news of it failed bid things went from bad to worse for premiere as its shares plunged 39 percent to 14.50 euros on the news and analysts projected a possible 33 percent drop in subscribers over the next few years on the back of its failure to secure the rights to german soccer . the dfl also awarded the rights to the two sunday bundesliga matches to german sports broadcaster dsf during the meeting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de broadcasters in bidding war over soccer coverage might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .

" you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2005 germany sour over us-eu wine deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's wine shops may soon be flooded by american drink the eu has approved a transatlantic deal opening the glutted european wine market to imports from the us .
but germany has called for imposing a " purity law " to protect european wines from us vintners ' practices . german agriculture minister horst seehofer said a new european union code is necessary to assure the quality of european wines .
us practices such as adding water to dilute the alcohol and ageing wine with woodchips to improve flavor are unacceptable in europe , he said . " it 's absolutely unclear why we bother having rules for the production and labeling of wine in europe if they are not applied to agreements with other countries , " he said . numerous european lawmakers have long accused the us industry of cheapening wine by using the new methods .
adding water and sugar to wine is permitted in the united states but not the eu , as are so-called designer wines , which are separated into their various components in laboratories before being rebuilt for a more consistent taste . but under the deal reached by eu and us negotiators , which only germany , austria and portugal opposed , the two sides will mutually recognize each other 's winemaking practices .
they will also open more detailed talks on protecting geographical indications and the status of low alcohol wines .
europea n culture or artificial product ?
faced with the new agreement , italy has asked for a change in eu law to allow the use of wood chips .
the eu has already allowed scientific testing but it is still banned commercially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu winemakers are more restricted than us producers the president of the association of german prädikat wine estates , michael prinz zu salm-salm , said he is hopeful it will stay that way . " we are wine growers , not winemakers , " he said .
" we take what nature gives us to carefully craft the best wines we can .
i 'm worried that customers wo n't be able to recognize whether they 're buying a part of european culture or an artificial product . " but many eu member states said they supported the 2.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- deal because it avoids burdensome certification procedures that might further slow sluggish sales outside of europe . they were also eager to see the us administration move on limiting the use of 17 european names on american wines such as burgundy , champagne and chianti that until now have been considered " semi-generic " in the united states . sam edmonds -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

" berlin asked us to take special care to avoid that seyam is not apprehended in the transit zone of singapore airport , " a german police source is quoted as telling die zeit , according to an advance extract of the report published on tuesday .
" it does not matter to the americans that somebody is german or whether sovereignty is violated .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .

" berlin asked us to take special care to avoid that seyam is not apprehended in the transit zone of singapore airport , " a german police source is quoted as telling die zeit , according to an advance extract of the report published on tuesday .
" it does not matter to the americans that somebody is german or whether sovereignty is violated .
they are like rabid dogs , " the source added .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- denied the weekly 's description of the operation . " this measure did take place , but not for the purpose of protecting seyam from a third party - rather to ensure the realization of further investigations , " the bka said tuesday .

but germany has called for imposing a " purity law " to protect european wines from us vintners ' practices . german agriculture minister horst seehofer said a new european union code is necessary to assure the quality of european wines .
us practices such as adding water to dilute the alcohol and ageing wine with woodchips to improve flavor are unacceptable in europe , he said . " it 's absolutely unclear why we bother having rules for the production and labeling of wine in europe if they are not applied to agreements with other countries , " he said . numerous european lawmakers have long accused the us industry of cheapening wine by using the new methods .
adding water and sugar to wine is permitted in the united states but not the eu , as are so-called designer wines , which are separated into their various components in laboratories before being rebuilt for a more consistent taste . but under the deal reached by eu and us negotiators , which only germany , austria and portugal opposed , the two sides will mutually recognize each other 's winemaking practices .
they will also open more detailed talks on protecting geographical indications and the status of low alcohol wines .

the eu has already allowed scientific testing but it is still banned commercially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu winemakers are more restricted than us producers the president of the association of german prädikat wine estates , michael prinz zu salm-salm , said he is hopeful it will stay that way .

" we take what nature gives us to carefully craft the best wines we can .
i 'm worried that customers wo n't be able to recognize whether they 're buying a part of european culture or an artificial product . " but many eu member states said they supported the 2.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- deal because it avoids burdensome certification procedures that might further slow sluggish sales outside of europe . they were also eager to see the us administration move on limiting the use of 17 european names on american wines such as burgundy , champagne and chianti that until now have been considered " semi-generic " in the united states . sam edmonds -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue .

of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .

the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .

" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann .

the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.12.2005 pressure mounts on deutsche bank chief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann 's future is in doubt after the court ruling defendants in the long-running mannesmann case go back to court after germany 's highest court threw out a previous acquittal , reopening the trial .
the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .
the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .
the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann . " we will encourage him to stay , regardless of the personal hardship he would be put through -lrb- by a retrial -rrb- , " rolf breuer , the bank 's supervisory board chairman , told the ft . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss could be back in the dock germany 's highest court will decide wednesday whether to re-open the controversial mannesmann case - a decision that may see the head of germany 's largest bank , josef ackermann , in court again .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .
the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

" when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .

the old agreement with premiere as the main pay-tv partner was worth 300 million euros .
the contract includes the introduction of a live friday night bundesliga game . cable consortium dwarfs premiere offer to secure rights reports that the german soccer league could expect to reap more than 400 million euros for the rights were proved to be correct as the cable consortium proved too powerful in the bidding stakes for the likes of premiere and german telecommunication giant deutsche telekom .
the dfl is set to pocket a staggering 1.26 billion euros from the rights in the three-year period . premiere , which had been seen as front-runner to secure the deal with an increased bid of more than 250 million euros , will continue to transmit live bundesliga matches during the rest of the current season . premiere also has the rights to show live all 64 matches of soccer 's 2006 world cup and in august bought the german rights to the uefa champions league soccer competition . " sportschau " retains prime slot despite pay-tv demands earlier this year , the pay-tv company demanded a bigger time gap between its live matches and ard 's " sportschau , " proposing that the free tv summary show be moved to a slot at 10 p.m.
the highlights show will now stay where it is in the schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere shares crashed on the news of it failed bid things went from bad to worse for premiere as its shares plunged 39 percent to 14.50 euros on the news and analysts projected a possible 33 percent drop in subscribers over the next few years on the back of its failure to secure the rights to german soccer . the dfl also awarded the rights to the two sunday bundesliga matches to german sports broadcaster dsf during the meeting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de broadcasters in bidding war over soccer coverage might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .

a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id .

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .

" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . " from iran 's point of view the subject of the talks is to remove the suspension of the uranium processing facilities and this must happen within a clear timetable , " hossein entezami , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told iranian state radio . iran will insist on the right to enrich uranium on its own soil during the talks , iran 's foreign minister manuchehr mottaki said in tehran .
" we do n't want talks just for the sake of talks , " mottaki told reporters . iran has rejected a russian idea to do some fuel cycle work at home while enriching uranium only on russian soil , which would keep this sensitive activity out of the country . " when we talk about -lrb- wanting -rrb- nuclear technology it means that enrichment to produce fuel for our reactors should be done inside iran and it means having the complete nuclear fuel cycle , " mottaki said . iran : isfahan " a done deal " and enrichment will resume bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enrichment at the isfahan plant will not be stopped again , says iran he added that uranium ore processing would not be suspended at the isfahan plant and that iran intended to restart preliminary work on enrichment technology .
" isfahan is a done deal , " he said .
" the research and building parts for -lrb- enrichment -rrb- centrifuges are not the same as enriching uranium .
when the time comes we will announce the resumption of these activities . " but mottaki said iran would give guarantees that enriched uranium would not be diverted for military ends .
however , such statements failed to inspire much hope in western diplomats . " the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

" the problem is , iran 's hardliners were encouraged to believe they could inch forward towards enrichment when they managed to restart uranium processing without provoking a referral to the u.n. security council , " one diplomat said . ahmadinejad 's stance makes progress difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president 's comments have made matters worse the tough stance comes at a time when iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad has raised an international outcry through a series of statements against israel , notably his remark in october that the jewish state should be wiped off the map . " it wo n't be easy , " a diplomat from one of the so-called eu-3 states told afp , saying the chances of getting iran to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons by agreeing to give up enrichment were " not very bright " . the diplomat noted that the two sides have not actually sat down together since april and that the iranian government has changed since then .
" there is a complete new set of people on the iranian side , so it 's going to be interesting , and a little bit unpredictable , " the diplomat said . an iranian diplomat said the talks were " just preliminary , setting the platform for the next round . " europe " realistic " about what 's possible in talks the eu-3 diplomat said the europeans are ready to be " realistic and distinguish between what is desirable and what is possible , " namely accepting some fuel cycle work but drawing the line at enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear is that iran is pursuing a nuclear warhead for its missiles the meeting was scheduled to be " talks about talks " to set the stage for a resumption of formal negotiations for a guarantee tehran will not make nuclear weapons . a breakdown at this stage could spark a push by the europeans and the united states , which backs the eu-3 initiative but is not attending the negotiations , to send the issue to the un security council for possible sanctions against iran . the united states argues that iran can not be trusted to carry out enrichment since this process gives nations a " break-out capacity " to make nuclear weapons . iran wants to at least be allowed to do research on centrifuges that carry out enrichment . russian involvement complicates un route " the real diplomatic work at the moment is trying to bring the russians on board so we can take this to the security council , " an eu-3 diplomat said . russia , which has a veto on the council , is building iran 's first nuclear power reactor and says there is no sign iran seeks atomic weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.12.2005 premiere loses live german soccer rights to cable group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live german soccer will move from premiere to a new home from the 2006/07 season the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- has dropped longtime partner , pay-tv company premiere , as the provider of live bundesliga games and has ruled in favor of a consortium of cable television operators . the new distribution of tv rights for german soccer will also see public broadcaster ard retain its immensely popular highlights show " sportschau " at its prime time slot of 6:30 p.m. the consortium , headed by germany 's biggest cable provider kabel deutschland and the unity media company , will host live games from the 2006/07 season after the dfl met with representatives of the bundesliga 's 32 clubs in frankfurt on wednesday . the new three-year contract is valid from the start of next season and is worth 420 million euros -lrb- $ 495 million -rrb- .
the old agreement with premiere as the main pay-tv partner was worth 300 million euros .
the contract includes the introduction of a live friday night bundesliga game . cable consortium dwarfs premiere offer to secure rights reports that the german soccer league could expect to reap more than 400 million euros for the rights were proved to be correct as the cable consortium proved too powerful in the bidding stakes for the likes of premiere and german telecommunication giant deutsche telekom .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .

farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the contract includes the introduction of a live friday night bundesliga game . cable consortium dwarfs premiere offer to secure rights reports that the german soccer league could expect to reap more than 400 million euros for the rights were proved to be correct as the cable consortium proved too powerful in the bidding stakes for the likes of premiere and german telecommunication giant deutsche telekom .

" sportschau " retains prime slot despite pay-tv demands earlier this year , the pay-tv company demanded a bigger time gap between its live matches and ard 's " sportschau , " proposing that the free tv summary show be moved to a slot at 10 p.m.

the move threatens to end the career of deutsche bank ceo ackermann . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann and his co-defendants - former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost - will now face further examination of their roles in the mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . the six men were accused of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fiercely contested takeover . in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . addressing the packed courtroom on wednesday , judge klaus tolksdorf said , " such a bonus is nothing other than a waste of money and that runs against their fiduciary duty , " " there was no incentive to management as a result of the payments . " " punishable behavior will not go unpunished just because some parties set themselves above the law , " tolksdorf said . a court in düsseldorf ruled last year that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences with or without probation for the defendants . but already at the end of october , judge tolksdorf expressed skepticism about the original acquittal .
the federal court of justice is germany 's highest appeals court for cases of civil and criminal law . ackerma n n 's positio n i n doubt after court ruli n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mannesmann trial part ii : ackermann and co. may not be so lucky this time the court 's decision to reopen the case and overturn the düsseldorf court 's acquittal will throw ackermann 's future as head of deutsche bank into doubt . having survived in his job during the original trial , where he was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , ackermann then managed to remain in his post despite coming under sustained fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and committing a series of damaging public relations blunders . ackermann 's lawyer said the ruling sent the case " back to square one " and insiders at deutsche bank admitted that it was a disappointment . financial experts see deutsche bank chief on borrowed time observers have said that ackermann 's return to court would be " unsupportable " for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing and that the highly unpopular swiss banker 's days could well be numbered . a german shareholders ' protection group suggested in the wake of the ruling that ackermann should resign .
" deutsche bank is stumbling from one image problem to the next .
this can not continue , " said jürgen kurz , a representative of the dsw organization in an interview with associated press .
he added that the bank needed to find a solution , " but i do n't think one is possible with ackermann . " " deutsche bank actually can not afford to have a boss who will again be in the dock for months , " said ulrich hocker , dsw 's managing director .
" mr ackermann is increasingly becoming a problem for the company . " wolfgang gerke , a banking professor at the university of erlangen-nuremberg , told reuters that he expected ackermann to step down at the beginning of next year . germany 's financial watchdog bafin said it would not push for ackermann to resign following the ruling , but agreed that the retrial is likely to increase pressure on him to step down . deutsche ba n k supports chief despite successio n pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank already has a contingency plan in case ackermann quits a fi n a n cial times report wednesday said that the bank has already put a succession plan into action to find a replacement for ackermann if he chooses to resign his post . ackermann knows that a retrial could further tarnish the reputation of the bank he has led for just three years and may quit if a retrial drags on , a senior deutsche bank official had said before the judgment . rainer neske , the head of the bank 's retail banking operations is emerging as the most likely candidate if ackerman quits , senior officials at deutsche bank told the paper . deutsche bank , however , has maintained that ackermann 's job is secure and reiterated its stance that he did the " right thing " at mannesmann . " we will encourage him to stay , regardless of the personal hardship he would be put through -lrb- by a retrial -rrb- , " rolf breuer , the bank 's supervisory board chairman , told the ft . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank boss could be back in the dock germany 's highest court will decide wednesday whether to re-open the controversial mannesmann case - a decision that may see the head of germany 's largest bank , josef ackermann , in court again .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .

of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

the german cabinet has approved plans to use the nation 's swollen ranks of unemployed as seasonal laborers rather than relying on temporary foreign workers from central and eastern europe . the aim , as set out by german labor minister franz müntefering , is to replace 10 percent of the 325,000 foreign farm laborers who were granted temporary leave to help with the harvest in 2005 , with jobless german nationals in 2006 and 2007 . under the new regulations , each farm will be eligible to employ 80 percent of the number of foreign workers it hired in 2005 .
a further ten percent could be added to a farm 's harvest payroll on condition that there are no german laborers available to do the work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much farm work is still done by hand germany 's employment agency has praised the proposals as sensible .
spokesman john-philip hammersen said it was the right thing to do , to grant what work there is in germany to those on the dole . he said he was not convinced that this was the time to be bringing foreign workers to germany . but the association of german farmers has criticized the plans , which they say will not promote labor market growth because the jobs would only be temporary .
farmers say their own experience of temporary german workers is that they are often put off by the tough physical nature of the work , and are prone to running to the doctor for a sick note . hammersen says that although unemployment benefit recipients are obliged to take what work they are offered , they are often prepared to forego a slice of their unemployment money rather than take on agricultural work . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controlling eu farming subsidies eu member states pay millions into the european union each year .

" but western diplomats earlier warned that hopes were slim for getting tehran to abandon its plans to enrich uranium it says is purely to make fuel for nuclear power reactors . the talks between foreign ministry officials from britain , france and germany and the iranian delegation headed by vaidi are the first contact between the two sides since talks broke off in august , when iran resumed uranium conversion . conversion is the first step in making enriched uranium , and while tehran has so far gone no further it made clear wednesday it would not back down on the right to do so , which it claims is guaranteed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .
geology and life sciences have made enormous progress , and this can not simply be ignored .

" berlin asked us to take special care to avoid that seyam is not apprehended in the transit zone of singapore airport , " a german police source is quoted as telling die zeit , according to an advance extract of the report published on tuesday .
" it does not matter to the americans that somebody is german or whether sovereignty is violated .
they are like rabid dogs , " the source added .
germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- denied the weekly 's description of the operation . " this measure did take place , but not for the purpose of protecting seyam from a third party - rather to ensure the realization of further investigations , " the bka said tuesday .

according to the report , the german government , then headed by former chancellor gerhard schröder , was informed of the case .
after 10 months in prison , seyam was then reportedly handed over to the german police who accompanied him back to the western german city of frankfurt , despite indications by the cia that they wished to question him again .
germany 's attorney general is reportedly investigating seyam for suspected links to terrorism . according to the associated press , seyman was an acquaintance of khaled el-masri , the german-lebanese man who is suing the united states for kidnapping him on dec .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .
" a literal interpretation of biblical creationist myths no longer suit our times .

while a us court this week ruled that evolution must be taught as a fact in pennsylvania schools , a small group in germany is trying to advocate alternatives .
it believes that an " intelligent designer " created life . did god create mankind or are we derived from apes ?
this question has caused a stir ever since charles darwin published his theory of evolution in " the origin of species " in 1859 .
for scientists , the answer is simple : our planet is the result of billions of years of evolution . " evolution is a documented fact , " said ulrich kutschera , a professor at the university of kassel and one of germany 's leading evolutionary biologists .
but a small group of skeptics is claiming that evolution is not the scientific explanation for our planet 's existence . intelligent design -lrb- id -rrb- is a movement that has become considerably popular in the united states in the past several years and is now gaining ground in germany , too .
id supporters believe that an " intelligent force " played a role in the development of the universe , as opposed to it being the result of random natural selection as argued by darwin . the id theory states that nature could not have developed in such a complex manner without the work of a designer - who is unnamed - or higher being .
it differs from creationism in that it does not advocate taking the bible literally . " neo-creatio n ist propaga n da " the leading id proponent in germany is wort und wissen -lrb- or word and knowledge -rrb- .
the society , based in the small town baiersbronn in the black forest , organizes lectures and publishes evolution-critical books and pamphlets for adults and children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : id theorists see a connection to creationist beliefs the munich microbiologist siegfried scherer , who heads wort und wissen , said that it was " not entirely unthinkable " from a biologist 's perspective that all humans derived from adam and eve . " you could consider that there were tiny populations in the distant past , which spread out to become humanity , " scherer told german public television zdf . scherer and fellow wort und wissen secretary reinhard junker are the authors of the controversial work , " evolution - a critical textbook " .
using pseudo-scientific terminology , they outline a model in which organisms developed from basic types created by an intelligent being . scientists , though , strongly criticize the theory .
" if perfectly created species existed , then the perfect human would n't get slipped discs , or die of cancer and dinosaurs would n't have become extinct , " said biologist kutschera .
he added that the book was " a successful piece of german neo-creationist propaganda " , which conveyed a biased view of evolution . id supporters wa n t alter n atives taught although wort und wissen has existed since the early 1980s , public and media interest in its work has only developed recently .
kutschera said it is because people have only now " woken up " to the problem . " the internet is infested with this creationist rubbish , " kutschera said .
books such as scherer and junker 's are donated to school libraries across the country . according to wort und wissen , though , the book is solely " additional informational material for teachers and students , who want to deal with scientific arguments critical of evolution or alternative interpretations of biological data " .
wort und wissen said that it did not seek to introduce creationist theories into biology lessons and that these should remain in religious education . " however , the society wants scientific criticism of evolutionary teachings to be adequately explored , " it said in a statement .
this also belonged in biology class , it said . germa n schools will stick to evolutio n wort und wissen said it would not take legal steps to force id or creationist theory in schools , as is the case in the united states .
last month , the kansas board of education approved new public school science standards that cast doubt on the theory of evolution .
on tuesday , though , a us court in pennsylvania ruled it was unconstitutional to teach schoolchildren the intelligent design theory of life as an alternative to evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darwin 's work still causes controversy today german education officials said they did n't expect the debate to become a major issue . " this development will not reach germany , " said sylvia schill , spokeswoman for the kultusmi n isterko n fere n z , the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the german länder . " evolution is taught in biology class in all german schools , " schill said .
references to creationism , on the other hand , are made in religious instruction at school . " there are no endeavors to change this , nor will there be in the foreseeable future , " she said . better educatio n about evolutio n n ecessary but , id theories , it seems , are likely to find a willing audience in germany . a recent survey by the research group weltanschauung in germany fowid showed that 38 percent of the population disputed evolution .
of this , 13 percent believed god created life as written in the bible .
a further 25 percent were convinced that life was created by a higher being , and then followed a process guided by this being . in comparison , a gallup poll released last month in the united states showed that 53 percent of american adults agreed with the statement that god created humans in their present form exactly the way the bible describes it .
thirty-one percent stood by the id stance , while only 12 percent said humans evolved from other forms of life and " god has no part " . according to kutschera , education is the best tool to counteract movements such as id . " more emphasis is necessary on biology in german schools in order to counteract the lack of knowledge about evolution , " he said .

as it enters into its fifth year , trying to measure success , failure or even just progress remains stubbornly difficult .
and the record for 2005 provides few easy answers .
the us administration used to talk about how it had killed or captured two-thirds of al-qaeda 's pre-9/11 leaders .
president bush has been on tv defending the us role in iraq but that statistic looks increasingly irrelevant when al-qaeda has itself evolved and mutated , with a new generation of militants and leaders over the past few years - as well as the problem that the best known al-qaeda leaders remain at large .
the battle is now increasingly being recognised as an ideological one rather than a manhunt .
but if that is true , how do you measure recruitment , radicalisation and the broader factors which might help judge the state of play in the ideological struggle ?
some of the brutal tactics from al-qaeda-related groups in iraq , as well as the body count of innocent muslims in attacks in places like amman , may have dented some of the appeal of al-qaeda 's ideology to moderate muslims .
however , reports of us abuses of detainees in iraq and elsewhere have done the us no favours in trying to win people to its cause .
the furore over the alleged " rendition " and torture of suspects that has arisen in europe at the end of 2005 also risks undermining the kind of international co-operation that is vital in defeating terrorism and fracturing crucial alliances .
differing strategies european governments are also looking inwards at their own problems in trying to work out how to increase security whilst not alienating their own muslim communities , who are often angry over what is happening in iraq .
zarqawi 's rise highlights how central iraq is to the " war on terror " different strategies between europe and the us are becoming increasingly evident , although it is not clear which strategies are more effective .
differences in approach are growing even between the closest of allies .
parts of the uk government are thought to be quite uncomfortable with some aspects of us counter-terrorist strategy , including the widespread use of mass detention as a policy in iraq , as well as the use of so-called " extraordinary rendition " in individual cases which the uk has tried to keep at arms length from .
from al-qaeda 's side , osama bin laden has not been heard from since a broadcast on the eve of the us elections in november 2004 , and in the eyes of many observers , the past year has seen him eclipsed by the rise of abu musab al-zarqawi .
although zarqawi officially put himself under al-qaeda 's banner , his precise relationship with the al-qaeda leadership is the subject of considerable debate , with many analysts believing that relations are as much competitive as they are co-operative .
jordan 's king called for a war on extremists after amman attacks zarqawi 's rise to prominence is an indication of just how central iraq has become to the war on terror .
it may not have been before the war , but it is certainly now the central front .
it is also a " black hole " in the words of french anti-terrorism judge jean-louis bruguiere , drawing in jihadists from around the world to fight , including increasing numbers from europe - december saw the first female european muslim convert take part in a suicide attack .
the question will be : what happens next ?
how many of these people will take the skills , militancy and networks of relationships they have developed in iraq back to their home countries ?
will iraq thereby play the same role that afghanistan did in the 1980s as the breeding ground for a new generation of militants ?
iraq 's neighbours are likely to be the first to see any signs of this , and saudi arabia will be especially closely watched for signs of iraq returnees causing trouble .
future threat the london bombings on 7 july killed 52 people al-qaeda may have evolved , but the ability of the core leadership to plan and direct attacks remains a fundamental unanswered question .
the investigation continues into london 's 7 july bombings , with the trail still leading into pakistan .
here it is suspected - but not yet confirmed - that evidence will be found to show that there was some form of international direction or support for the attacks .
but whether such attacks are planned directly by al-qaeda 's leadership or not , 2005 has shown that the danger from terrorism remains global , with serious attacks across a wide geographical spread from london to amman to bali .
next year is unlikely to be any different .

as it enters into its fifth year , trying to measure success , failure or even just progress remains stubbornly difficult .
and the record for 2005 provides few easy answers .
the us administration used to talk about how it had killed or captured two-thirds of al-qaeda 's pre-9/11 leaders .
president bush has been on tv defending the us role in iraq but that statistic looks increasingly irrelevant when al-qaeda has itself evolved and mutated , with a new generation of militants and leaders over the past few years - as well as the problem that the best known al-qaeda leaders remain at large .
the battle is now increasingly being recognised as an ideological one rather than a manhunt .
but if that is true , how do you measure recruitment , radicalisation and the broader factors which might help judge the state of play in the ideological struggle ?
some of the brutal tactics from al-qaeda-related groups in iraq , as well as the body count of innocent muslims in attacks in places like amman , may have dented some of the appeal of al-qaeda 's ideology to moderate muslims .
however , reports of us abuses of detainees in iraq and elsewhere have done the us no favours in trying to win people to its cause .
the furore over the alleged " rendition " and torture of suspects that has arisen in europe at the end of 2005 also risks undermining the kind of international co-operation that is vital in defeating terrorism and fracturing crucial alliances .
differing strategies european governments are also looking inwards at their own problems in trying to work out how to increase security whilst not alienating their own muslim communities , who are often angry over what is happening in iraq .
zarqawi 's rise highlights how central iraq is to the " war on terror " different strategies between europe and the us are becoming increasingly evident , although it is not clear which strategies are more effective .
differences in approach are growing even between the closest of allies .
parts of the uk government are thought to be quite uncomfortable with some aspects of us counter-terrorist strategy , including the widespread use of mass detention as a policy in iraq , as well as the use of so-called " extraordinary rendition " in individual cases which the uk has tried to keep at arms length from .
from al-qaeda 's side , osama bin laden has not been heard from since a broadcast on the eve of the us elections in november 2004 , and in the eyes of many observers , the past year has seen him eclipsed by the rise of abu musab al-zarqawi .
although zarqawi officially put himself under al-qaeda 's banner , his precise relationship with the al-qaeda leadership is the subject of considerable debate , with many analysts believing that relations are as much competitive as they are co-operative .
jordan 's king called for a war on extremists after amman attacks zarqawi 's rise to prominence is an indication of just how central iraq has become to the war on terror .
it may not have been before the war , but it is certainly now the central front .
it is also a " black hole " in the words of french anti-terrorism judge jean-louis bruguiere , drawing in jihadists from around the world to fight , including increasing numbers from europe - december saw the first female european muslim convert take part in a suicide attack .

popular striker pham van quyen and mid-fielder le quoc vuong were detained near hanoi late on tuesday .
the arrests are the latest in a series of bribery and gambling scandals to hit vietnamese football .
more than 20 referees , coaches and officials are currently facing charges of match-fixing in the past year .
the problem has become so common that when told about the latest arrests , sports minister nguyen danh thai said he was not surprised .
" i was not shocked by the news that some players fixed matches , " he was quoted as telling the state newspaper thanh nien .
gambling is widespread in vietnam , despite being banned , and millions of dollars often change hands during football matches .
the two footballers were arrested for " indulging in betting on games and organising betting , " according to vietnam football federation president nguyen trong hy .
" if it is true that my son has participated in game-fixing , i will be very sad and disappointed , " ho thi niem , van quyen 's mother , told the bbc vietnamese service .
" i still do n't believe that my son has done anything wrong , but i do n't know .
the investigation authorities have n't told me anything .
i 'm very saddened by the whole affair . "
at least five members of vietnam 's team are under suspicion for fixing matches during this month 's south east asian games .
matches with burma and malaysia are among those being investigated .

the government is trying to counter a string of deadly bombings , assumed to be the work of islamic militants .
" the existing laws are not enough to deal with this type of violence .
we need a new anti-terrorism law , " said law minister moudud ahmed .
nearly 30 people have died in a series of suicide bombings since august .
the attacks have targeted judges , lawyers , police and journalists .
faster trials police have arrested almost 800 suspects , many of them members of the militant jamaat-ul-mujahideen , which is demanding hardline islamic law in secular bangladesh .
they include the group 's suspected operations commander , ataur rahman sunny , who was held during a raid in the capital , dhaka , last wednesday .
" what we are planning is a comprehensive law to tackle terrorism , " mr ahmed told a bangladesh tv station .
he said the legislation would cover everyone from those who " encourage , motivate , provide training and money to those who are involved in the terrorist acts " .
he promised that the maximum sentence would be boosted from 10 years to death , and that special tribunals would speed up trials .
' anyone a target ' meanwhile christian leaders in bangladesh said they were planning special precautions to guard against the threat of violence over the christmas period .
churches have not been the target of the recent attacks , but senior priests said they would be taking measures , such as checking churchgoers and closing church car parks , to protect congregations .
" while terrorists resort to bombings in the name of religion , anyone can be a target , " said father benjamin de costa , principal of dhaka 's notre dame college .
" in the present circumstances , nothing can be ruled out . "

" when i look at my parents , i remember my grandparents ' laugh and feel sad .
" but i have to keep moving on , and helping other people who suffered more than i have .
" for the community , it 's time to be optimistic , to rebuild for a better life . "
those are the hopes of lenawati , a red cross volunteer and counselling student who lost her grandparents when the tsunami hit her home in banda aceh , indonesia .
she was at sea when the wave struck land , killing hundreds of thousands of people and causing the absolute devastation seen in pictures shown around the world .
record totals one year on , she is working for the charity , whose projects in the region are funded in part by donations from the uk tsunami appeal .
the red cross livelihoods programme rebuilds homes and helps the community - its farmers , fishermen and traders - put their lives back together .
the other 28 members of his family had been killed by the tsunami .
that 's the scale of it brendan cox oxfam one year on : your comments the charity raised £ 85.9m in tsunami relief donations .
of that , £ 23.1m came from the british red cross appeal , £ 3.5m from the government 's department for international development and £ 59.3m from the disasters emergency committee -lrb- dec -rrb- .
it is one of the 13 charities that share the dec 's unprecedented pot of £ 372m donated by the british public .
a further £ 50m was given directly to the charities themselves .
more than a third of donations - £ 128m - has been spent so far .
but where and how ?
the cash has funded emergency relief , medium-term projects and / or long-term planning for the future in affected countries .
" the money has saved and protected lives and given people better conditions to live in after the tsunami , " says alastair burnett , of the british red cross .
the charity received one of the largest amounts from the set dec percentage allocations .
in the first 3-4 months it spent £ 12.3m on emergency relief - tents , tarpaulins , clothing , kitchen equipment , body bags and transportation .
it sent teams to sri lanka and banda aceh to clear the relief goods through quickly and dispatched an operational team to help in banda .
tsunami-resilient homes now and during the next three years , £ 59.4m will go on rebuilding homes and lives and protecting against future disasters .
indonesia is the biggest beneficiary at £ 40m .
sri lanka will receive £ 5m .
in indonesia , for example , some of that will be used to upgrade temporary living centres to get people out of tents and into steel-framed wooden-walled shelters .
on six islands in the maldives , 744 tsunami-resilient homes for 4,600 people are being rebuilt .
a £ 14.2m contingency fund is being set aside for longer term funding , into 2007/8 and beyond .
we had to ask the question , ' do we just give the rich guy the boat back ? '
alastair burnett british red cross despite the initial fears people had about returning to tsunami-hit areas , says alastair , they now want to return " home " .
in some places , the first signs of long-term recovery are apparent - houses going up and small businesses being established .
the next challenge is to re-establish a community .
" responsible recovery takes time , " he says .
" we are committed to putting people back into functioning communities that are going to be safe , rather than a quick fix . "
lives rebuilt at the micro level , a 1m rupiah - or £ 58 - grant from oxfam has enabled the man running the port cafe in banda aceh to rebuild and restock .
the charity 's emergency specialist brendan cox visited the newly-named cafe oxfam in november .
it has taken months to clear some wells of salination " i talked to him about where he was living , " he says .
" he said ' it 's just me and my son living here ' , because the other 28 members of his family had been killed by the tsunami .
and that 's the scale of it .
" but the fact that this guy has taken just a little bit of money is not just testament to the generosity of the british people , but to the amazing resilience of people who have rebuilt their lives despite the personal tragedy they have been through . "
oxfam uk raised £ 86m , including dec money .
it helped with emergency food , utensils , clothes and plastic shelter sheeting in india and sri lanka a couple of hours after the disaster hit .
scale of problem by march and april , it was still working to clear bodies .
cash for work programmes to stimulate the local economies got under way .
brendan talks about the clear-up work completed in galle and matara , sri lanka , where 95 % of people are out of tented camps and into transitional shelters and people have returned to work - even at sea .
there is also the " massive building site " in banda aceh , where a quarter of the required houses will be built this year .
but spending the uk aid has not always been straightforward .
charity , agency and government reports have been critical of some of the disaster response .
there were major problems brought on by the scale of the disaster through to challenges in treading carefully with local custom .
oxfam was stretched by the disaster hitting 10 countries spread across a wide area ; the one container port in aceh and infrastructure was destroyed .
rebuilding in indonesia , sri lanka and india is on the scale of constructing birmingham and glasgow combined .
flooding left coastal communities landless , buffer zones were drawn and redrawn , and the threat of expulsion hung over charities in indonesia until march 2005 .
culture consideration in replacing fishermen 's boats in sri lanka , the red cross had to tread carefully .
boats were owned by richer mudalalis - local business people - and crewed by poorer workers .
" we had to ask the question , ' do we just give the rich guy the boat back ? " ' says alastair .
after initial fears , fishermen have returned to the sea with new boats " we had to negotiate with the mudalalis over types of ownership and profit margins to make sure that the workers get a more equitable share . "
challenges in scale and custom combined for care international in sri lanka .
annually 7-8,000 homes are built in the country .
but the tsunami destroyed 80,000 .
the charity has built 54,000 temporary houses , according to the rules of bastu shastra - the local form of feng shui .
and save the children uk raised £ 71.7m to deal with the particular problems faced by children in the disaster and child protection .
back to school in sri lanka , almost 1,000 children lost both parents ; 4,000 lost one .
it reunited thousands of children with their families , fostered others and is working on mid-to-long-term projects to set up children 's centres , safe play areas , schools and provide teachers .
thousands of homes have been built in aceh province the scale is huge but , as oxfam points out , there is plenty of recovery funding .
for lenawati in indonesia , that should mean her aims will be realised .
" i hope that after the programmes , acehenese people can not depend solely on international aid , " she says .
" we can rebuild ourselves and be independent .
hopefully , with all my heart . "

the relatives of some of his victims also insisted he did not deserve a commuted sentence because he had not owned up to his crimes and refused to inform on fellow gang members .
