program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .

only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .

it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .

the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .

but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .

friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .

" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .

brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .

there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man who sparked the orange revolution deserves better ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . it 's strange - just a few weeks ago , the waves of elation were at their peak .
in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .

but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

on sunday , felix magath 's team faces their nearest rival , schalke 04 . the final 10 games of the bundesliga season begin saturday , but the highlight match is on sunday when league-leader bayern munich travels to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 , who are even on points .
there has been lots of talk coming from both sides before this match - mind games to psyche out the opponent .
munich 's vice president , karl-heinz rummenigge , told sport-bild that bayern will always be better than schalke 04 .
and comments like those from schalke manager rudi assauer , that schalke would be the richest german team in 15 years , are cannon fodder for rummenigge .
" as long as schalke is standing in the line for bank loans and bayern is in line to withdraw deposits , " the legendary bayern striker said , " i can only grin about such statements . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 's manager rudi assauer , -lrb- right , with former coach jupp heynckes -rrb- has ambitious plans for the ruhr valley club - wanting even to overtake bayern munich as germany 's wealthiest those are strong words coming from a side that has n't won in gelsenkirchen since 1998 .
schalke striker ebbe sand knows that no matter the outcome on sunday , the royal blues will finish the season on top .
" bayern definitely have the better players , " the danish international told kicker magazine , " but we have the better team . "
and may the better team , or better group of players if you 're a munich fan , win .
saturday offers a helping of desperation before the bundesliga 's best two teams clash on sunday , saturday sees the league 's worst teams scrambling to improve their slim chances to remain in the top division .
the bottom four clubs face each other when cellar-dweller freiburg -lrb- 16 points -rrb- take on nuremberg -lrb- 15th place , 25 points -rrb- and bochum -lrb- 16th , 19 points -rrb- travel to rostock -lrb- 17th , 17 points -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nuremberg 's marek mintal -lrb- left -rrb- continue to carry his team against freiburg ?
nuremberg still stand close to the relegation zone , but coach wolfgang wolf has the league 's top scorer in marek mintal -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- who single-handedly has outscored freiburg -lrb- 18 goals total -rrb- .
freiburg 's punchless attack is complemented by a defense that can best be compared to a sieve .
volker finke 's team has let in a league-high 50 goals .
bochum have a little more oomph up front -lrb- 29 goals -rrb- but their defense has let them down also , having given up 50 goals as well .
rostock won their first game under coach jörg berger last week .
now , berger believes his team can make up the ground necessary to avoid relegation .
board chairman manfred wimmer was more realistic after the victory : " it was a sign of life , nothing more . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 tackling sour eu-asean relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's infineon already produces silcon wafers in singapore the european union believes trade with the countries in south east asia has a promising future .
human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .

only one point separates the two sides .
hertha lie in fifth , leverkusen in seventh .
leverkusen are now out of the champions league and can concentrate on league play .
they have been particularly good against berlin , having won eight of 10 home matches .
berlin might be pleased with one point , something they are quite good at , with 10 draws , tops in the league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's sylvain wiltord -lrb- middle -rrb- scored four goals against bremen in the champions league round of 16 match-up bremen return to bundesliga play after their 7-2 drubbing at the hands of french champions olympique lyon in the champions league .
the task looks easy - a home game against 14th-place mainz .
yet , in the first leg , when jürgen klopp 's boys stood for spassfussball , or fun soccer , mainz beat the reigning champions 2-1 .
after last week 's loss at bayern , thomas schaaf 's side may only be playing for third-place , which they are currently holding onto by one point ahead of stuttgart .
another uefa contender are hamburger sv .
bielefeld present no threat to hamburg in the table , but uwe rapolder 's side is strong at home .
the most impressive win was the comprehensive 3-1 over bayern munich on feb .
13 .
hsv , on the other hand , have won five of seven matches in the second leg .
former high-flyers meet after the 13th match day , wolfsburg -lrb- 8th place , 34 points -rrb- and hanover -lrb- 10th , 32 -rrb- were sitting pretty in the standings .
wolfsburg were in first , hanover fifth .
since then , the high-flyers have plummeted back to earth - and reality .
the dreams of extra revenue from international play are long past , but the early success has taken the two teams far away from the relegation fight .
many of the players on both sides are competing for spots in the next season .
wolfsburg 's team manager , thomas strunz , plans to part ways with eight players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals from strikers , like this one from ioannis amanatidis against schalke 04 , have been in short supply for fc kaiserslautern in the second leg .
only two of 10 have come from the fck 's men up front kaiserslautern rest in ninth place and have been playing inspired soccer since a miserable start .
one of the bitterest early losses was to this weekend 's opponent , borussia mönchengladbach .
lautern lost 2-0 , but one of the goals was an intentional handball strike by gladbach striker oliver neuville .
kurt jara 's squad probably has n't forgotten that piece of injustice .
finally , on sunday , stuttgart play at bvb dortmund .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer gave up his coaching duties at bvb after last season but still commands a great deal respect from the dortmund fans .
stuttgart could increase the pressure on bremen with a win .
dortmund have experienced a renaissance of late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man who sparked the orange revolution deserves better ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . it 's strange - just a few weeks ago , the waves of elation were at their peak .
in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , warsaw to boost ukrainian democracy germany and poland plan to step up efforts to strengthen ukraine 's fledgling democracy .
but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .

only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .

immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man who sparked the orange revolution deserves better ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . it 's strange - just a few weeks ago , the waves of elation were at their peak .
in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , warsaw to boost ukrainian democracy germany and poland plan to step up efforts to strengthen ukraine 's fledgling democracy .
but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 tackling sour eu-asean relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's infineon already produces silcon wafers in singapore the european union believes trade with the countries in south east asia has a promising future .
human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

only one point separates the two sides .
hertha lie in fifth , leverkusen in seventh .
leverkusen are now out of the champions league and can concentrate on league play .
they have been particularly good against berlin , having won eight of 10 home matches .
berlin might be pleased with one point , something they are quite good at , with 10 draws , tops in the league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's sylvain wiltord -lrb- middle -rrb- scored four goals against bremen in the champions league round of 16 match-up bremen return to bundesliga play after their 7-2 drubbing at the hands of french champions olympique lyon in the champions league .
the task looks easy - a home game against 14th-place mainz .
yet , in the first leg , when jürgen klopp 's boys stood for spassfussball , or fun soccer , mainz beat the reigning champions 2-1 .
after last week 's loss at bayern , thomas schaaf 's side may only be playing for third-place , which they are currently holding onto by one point ahead of stuttgart .
another uefa contender are hamburger sv .
bielefeld present no threat to hamburg in the table , but uwe rapolder 's side is strong at home .
the most impressive win was the comprehensive 3-1 over bayern munich on feb .
13 .
hsv , on the other hand , have won five of seven matches in the second leg .
former high-flyers meet after the 13th match day , wolfsburg -lrb- 8th place , 34 points -rrb- and hanover -lrb- 10th , 32 -rrb- were sitting pretty in the standings .
wolfsburg were in first , hanover fifth .
since then , the high-flyers have plummeted back to earth - and reality .
the dreams of extra revenue from international play are long past , but the early success has taken the two teams far away from the relegation fight .
many of the players on both sides are competing for spots in the next season .
wolfsburg 's team manager , thomas strunz , plans to part ways with eight players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals from strikers , like this one from ioannis amanatidis against schalke 04 , have been in short supply for fc kaiserslautern in the second leg .
only two of 10 have come from the fck 's men up front kaiserslautern rest in ninth place and have been playing inspired soccer since a miserable start .
one of the bitterest early losses was to this weekend 's opponent , borussia mönchengladbach .
lautern lost 2-0 , but one of the goals was an intentional handball strike by gladbach striker oliver neuville .
kurt jara 's squad probably has n't forgotten that piece of injustice .
finally , on sunday , stuttgart play at bvb dortmund .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer gave up his coaching duties at bvb after last season but still commands a great deal respect from the dortmund fans .
stuttgart could increase the pressure on bremen with a win .
dortmund have experienced a renaissance of late .
the crisis-ridden first leg is more or less forgotten .
still hanging over the club management 's head like a black cloud is the miserable financial situation that threatens to cost them their soccer license dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win sets up two-horse title race bayern munich 's 1-0 win over reigning champions werder bremen on saturday kept the bavarian giants on top of the bundesliga .

" the information and communication industry has become an important growth engine for germany and the global economy , " schröder said .
he has hinted that his government could introduce new measures to boost the economy , but has so far not named specific project .
according to news reports , all cabinet members have been asked to come up with suggestions . it as germany 's saving grace ? the recovery of the it sector could be an important card in schröder 's hand as he attempts to pacify and convince conservative opposition leaders next week that his agenda 2010 reform plan is on track and will bring dividends in the future . after a dismal three years prompted by the collapse of the so-called new economy , the german computer , telecommunications and new media association bitkom revealed ahead of the cebit trade fair that the worst appeared to be over . " the information and communication sector is showing healthy economic growth and creating new jobs , " bitkom chief willi berchtold told reporters .

cebit is expected to draw 500,000 visitors and help trigger renewed excitement for the high-tech sector after the lengthy slump . chancellor to push growth-inducing measures schröder assured the executives at the cebit that everything would be done to maintain an atmosphere in which the industry could continue to prosper . " we will improve the growth dynamic with additional measures , " he said .

in a debate in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , both sides again expressed their willingness to continue reforming the german economy and to attend next week 's " job summit " with an open mind .
but the agreement basically ends there . the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected the ten-point program by the conservatives aimed at reducing unemployment that is part of the opposition 's so-called " pact for germany . "

she said germany need far-reaching reforms . " what we definitely wo n't support is a stop-gap program aimed at stimulating the economy by making new debts , " merkel said .
" what we really need are the types of structural changes proposed in our pact for germany . " the spd and greens , however , called the so-called pact pure party politics and said its proposals were nothing but " stale recipes .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

according to news reports , all cabinet members have been asked to come up with suggestions . it as germany 's saving grace ? the recovery of the it sector could be an important card in schröder 's hand as he attempts to pacify and convince conservative opposition leaders next week that his agenda 2010 reform plan is on track and will bring dividends in the future . after a dismal three years prompted by the collapse of the so-called new economy , the german computer , telecommunications and new media association bitkom revealed ahead of the cebit trade fair that the worst appeared to be over . " the information and communication sector is showing healthy economic growth and creating new jobs , " bitkom chief willi berchtold told reporters .

in a debate in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , both sides again expressed their willingness to continue reforming the german economy and to attend next week 's " job summit " with an open mind .
but the agreement basically ends there . the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected the ten-point program by the conservatives aimed at reducing unemployment that is part of the opposition 's so-called " pact for germany . "

she said germany need far-reaching reforms . " what we definitely wo n't support is a stop-gap program aimed at stimulating the economy by making new debts , " merkel said .
" what we really need are the types of structural changes proposed in our pact for germany . " the spd and greens , however , called the so-called pact pure party politics and said its proposals were nothing but " stale recipes .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .

myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .

" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

on sunday , felix magath 's team faces their nearest rival , schalke 04 . the final 10 games of the bundesliga season begin saturday , but the highlight match is on sunday when league-leader bayern munich travels to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 , who are even on points .
there has been lots of talk coming from both sides before this match - mind games to psyche out the opponent .
munich 's vice president , karl-heinz rummenigge , told sport-bild that bayern will always be better than schalke 04 .
and comments like those from schalke manager rudi assauer , that schalke would be the richest german team in 15 years , are cannon fodder for rummenigge .
" as long as schalke is standing in the line for bank loans and bayern is in line to withdraw deposits , " the legendary bayern striker said , " i can only grin about such statements . "

schalke striker ebbe sand knows that no matter the outcome on sunday , the royal blues will finish the season on top .
" bayern definitely have the better players , " the danish international told kicker magazine , " but we have the better team . "
and may the better team , or better group of players if you 're a munich fan , win .
saturday offers a helping of desperation before the bundesliga 's best two teams clash on sunday , saturday sees the league 's worst teams scrambling to improve their slim chances to remain in the top division .
the bottom four clubs face each other when cellar-dweller freiburg -lrb- 16 points -rrb- take on nuremberg -lrb- 15th place , 25 points -rrb- and bochum -lrb- 16th , 19 points -rrb- travel to rostock -lrb- 17th , 17 points -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nuremberg 's marek mintal -lrb- left -rrb- continue to carry his team against freiburg ?
nuremberg still stand close to the relegation zone , but coach wolfgang wolf has the league 's top scorer in marek mintal -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- who single-handedly has outscored freiburg -lrb- 18 goals total -rrb- .
freiburg 's punchless attack is complemented by a defense that can best be compared to a sieve .
volker finke 's team has let in a league-high 50 goals .
bochum have a little more oomph up front -lrb- 29 goals -rrb- but their defense has let them down also , having given up 50 goals as well .
rostock won their first game under coach jörg berger last week .
now , berger believes his team can make up the ground necessary to avoid relegation .
board chairman manfred wimmer was more realistic after the victory : " it was a sign of life , nothing more . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just do n't ask for id an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the man who sparked the orange revolution deserves better ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . it 's strange - just a few weeks ago , the waves of elation were at their peak .
in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .
ukraine needs the solidarity of the west ; it ca n't be left alone now . cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .

" we are reaping the benefits of the up-front expenditure previously incurred to launch new products and to expand the international sales organization , " said chairman helmut panke .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .

at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .
get the bastard , madam , get the bastard .

but underlying profits were up as a result of higher electricity and gas prices .
the düsseldorf based company said in a statement that it had earned a total € 4.339 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 billion -rrb- at the bottom line in 2004 .
that 's 6.6 percent less than the year-earlier figure .
nevertheless , operating profit , as measured by earnings before interest and tax -lrb- ebit -rrb- , was up 11 percent at € 7.361 billion due to higher electricity and gas prices .
as a result , e.on planned to pay an increased dividend to shareholders of € 2.35 per share , up from € 2.0 for 2003 . for the current year , the group was forecasting a " slight rise " in earnings compared with 2004 levels .

bmw said in a statement it planned to pay an increased dividend of € 0.62 -lrb- $ 0.83 -rrb- per ordinary share for 2004 , compared with € 0.58 for 2003 .
and the dividend for preference shareholders would be upped to € 0.64 euros per share from € 0.60 euros .
the increased dividend was made possible after bottom-line profits sped ahead by 14.1 percent to € 2.22 billion -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- last year , making 2004 the " most successful year " in bmw 's history , the car maker said .
the figure was higher than analysts had been expecting .
operating profit was up by 10.9 percent at € 3.55 billion on a 6.8-percent rise in sales to € 44.335 billion .
" we are reaping the benefits of the up-front expenditure previously incurred to launch new products and to expand the international sales organization , " said chairman helmut panke .
bmw also said it would ask shareholders at the upcoming annual meeting for permission to buy back up to 10 percent of its share capital . dw-world.de remembering bmw 's " smooch ball " the bmw isetta is a german legend .
along with the vw bug and the goggomobil , the car stood out on the streets of mid-1950s west germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .
what happened there is a historic example , but also a thorn in the side for other nations living under russia 's sphere of influence .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .
it seemed that german politicians put more effort into dampening ukraine 's hopes of a speedy entry into the eu - hopes that the west stirred into being a few weeks ago with alluring insinuations when the ukrainian people took to the streets to demand democracy . eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian president viktor yushchenko addresses the members of the german parliament in berlin viktor yushchenko has been steadfastly pursuing his biggest foreign policy goal , which was clear from his speech in the bundestag - ukrainian membership in the eu .
and the president is linking this with a domestic policy strategy .
the path of reforms leading to europe is meant to increase the pressure within ukraine to act , allowing the president to realize social , political and economic changes . ukrainian membership in the eu is , for the medium term , illusory .
it would be too big a challenge for the eu , and ukraine is not ready yet .
yushchenko is certainly aware of this .
immense effort will be needed to modernize his country .
the success of democracy also depends on improving quality of life for its citizens .
hundreds of thousands of ukrainians have already left their country to move westward . ukraine is a desperately poor country .
president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .

on sunday , felix magath 's team faces their nearest rival , schalke 04 . the final 10 games of the bundesliga season begin saturday , but the highlight match is on sunday when league-leader bayern munich travels to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 , who are even on points .
there has been lots of talk coming from both sides before this match - mind games to psyche out the opponent .
munich 's vice president , karl-heinz rummenigge , told sport-bild that bayern will always be better than schalke 04 .
and comments like those from schalke manager rudi assauer , that schalke would be the richest german team in 15 years , are cannon fodder for rummenigge .
" as long as schalke is standing in the line for bank loans and bayern is in line to withdraw deposits , " the legendary bayern striker said , " i can only grin about such statements . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 04 's manager rudi assauer , -lrb- right , with former coach jupp heynckes -rrb- has ambitious plans for the ruhr valley club - wanting even to overtake bayern munich as germany 's wealthiest those are strong words coming from a side that has n't won in gelsenkirchen since 1998 .
schalke striker ebbe sand knows that no matter the outcome on sunday , the royal blues will finish the season on top .
" bayern definitely have the better players , " the danish international told kicker magazine , " but we have the better team . "

only one point separates the two sides .
hertha lie in fifth , leverkusen in seventh .
leverkusen are now out of the champions league and can concentrate on league play .
they have been particularly good against berlin , having won eight of 10 home matches .
berlin might be pleased with one point , something they are quite good at , with 10 draws , tops in the league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's sylvain wiltord -lrb- middle -rrb- scored four goals against bremen in the champions league round of 16 match-up bremen return to bundesliga play after their 7-2 drubbing at the hands of french champions olympique lyon in the champions league .
the task looks easy - a home game against 14th-place mainz .
yet , in the first leg , when jürgen klopp 's boys stood for spassfussball , or fun soccer , mainz beat the reigning champions 2-1 .
after last week 's loss at bayern , thomas schaaf 's side may only be playing for third-place , which they are currently holding onto by one point ahead of stuttgart .
another uefa contender are hamburger sv .
bielefeld present no threat to hamburg in the table , but uwe rapolder 's side is strong at home .
the most impressive win was the comprehensive 3-1 over bayern munich on feb .

hsv , on the other hand , have won five of seven matches in the second leg .
former high-flyers meet after the 13th match day , wolfsburg -lrb- 8th place , 34 points -rrb- and hanover -lrb- 10th , 32 -rrb- were sitting pretty in the standings .
wolfsburg were in first , hanover fifth .
since then , the high-flyers have plummeted back to earth - and reality .
the dreams of extra revenue from international play are long past , but the early success has taken the two teams far away from the relegation fight .
many of the players on both sides are competing for spots in the next season .
wolfsburg 's team manager , thomas strunz , plans to part ways with eight players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goals from strikers , like this one from ioannis amanatidis against schalke 04 , have been in short supply for fc kaiserslautern in the second leg .
only two of 10 have come from the fck 's men up front kaiserslautern rest in ninth place and have been playing inspired soccer since a miserable start .
one of the bitterest early losses was to this weekend 's opponent , borussia mönchengladbach .
lautern lost 2-0 , but one of the goals was an intentional handball strike by gladbach striker oliver neuville .
kurt jara 's squad probably has n't forgotten that piece of injustice .
finally , on sunday , stuttgart play at bvb dortmund .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer gave up his coaching duties at bvb after last season but still commands a great deal respect from the dortmund fans .
stuttgart could increase the pressure on bremen with a win .
dortmund have experienced a renaissance of late .
the crisis-ridden first leg is more or less forgotten .

the task looks easy - a home game against 14th-place mainz .
yet , in the first leg , when jürgen klopp 's boys stood for spassfussball , or fun soccer , mainz beat the reigning champions 2-1 .
after last week 's loss at bayern , thomas schaaf 's side may only be playing for third-place , which they are currently holding onto by one point ahead of stuttgart .
another uefa contender are hamburger sv .

wolfsburg were in first , hanover fifth .
since then , the high-flyers have plummeted back to earth - and reality .
the dreams of extra revenue from international play are long past , but the early success has taken the two teams far away from the relegation fight .
many of the players on both sides are competing for spots in the next season .
wolfsburg 's team manager , thomas strunz , plans to part ways with eight players .

only two of 10 have come from the fck 's men up front kaiserslautern rest in ninth place and have been playing inspired soccer since a miserable start .
one of the bitterest early losses was to this weekend 's opponent , borussia mönchengladbach .
lautern lost 2-0 , but one of the goals was an intentional handball strike by gladbach striker oliver neuville .
kurt jara 's squad probably has n't forgotten that piece of injustice .
finally , on sunday , stuttgart play at bvb dortmund .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy .

they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

" the information and communication industry has become an important growth engine for germany and the global economy , " schröder said .
he has hinted that his government could introduce new measures to boost the economy , but has so far not named specific project .
according to news reports , all cabinet members have been asked to come up with suggestions . it as germany 's saving grace ? the recovery of the it sector could be an important card in schröder 's hand as he attempts to pacify and convince conservative opposition leaders next week that his agenda 2010 reform plan is on track and will bring dividends in the future . after a dismal three years prompted by the collapse of the so-called new economy , the german computer , telecommunications and new media association bitkom revealed ahead of the cebit trade fair that the worst appeared to be over . " the information and communication sector is showing healthy economic growth and creating new jobs , " bitkom chief willi berchtold told reporters .
" people are delighted with modern technology again .
they are thrilled with new devices that are useful and fun . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german high-tech sales are set to rise 3.4 percent in 2005 to € 135.2 billion -lrb- $ 180.7 billion -rrb- and another 3.1 percent in 2006 , according to the group .
cebit is expected to draw 500,000 visitors and help trigger renewed excitement for the high-tech sector after the lengthy slump . chancellor to push growth-inducing measures schröder assured the executives at the cebit that everything would be done to maintain an atmosphere in which the industry could continue to prosper . " we will improve the growth dynamic with additional measures , " he said .
" i will present the concrete proposals in the german bundestag next week . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber schröder will meet with angela merkel , the leader of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on march 17 for a " job summit " to talk about strategies to tackle the nation 's record-high unemployment rate .
foreign minister joschka fischer , schröder 's vice-chancellor , will also attend the talks . " we will then see whether the opposition is ready to take up its responsibility , " schröder told the trade fair audience . disagreement going in but signs of compromise between the government and the opposition are hard to find .
in a debate in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , both sides again expressed their willingness to continue reforming the german economy and to attend next week 's " job summit " with an open mind .
but the agreement basically ends there . the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected the ten-point program by the conservatives aimed at reducing unemployment that is part of the opposition 's so-called " pact for germany . "
it would cut unemployment insurance premiums , make firing employees easier , cut bureaucracy and loosen some rules around industry-wide wage contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of the bundestag on thursday in the bundestag on thursday , christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader angela merkel said that with the plan , germany could be " could be lead out of its numbness " and that with 5.2 million unemployed and an expected growth rate of one percent , there was no question of simply continuing on the present course .
she said germany need far-reaching reforms . " what we definitely wo n't support is a stop-gap program aimed at stimulating the economy by making new debts , " merkel said .
" what we really need are the types of structural changes proposed in our pact for germany . " the spd and greens , however , called the so-called pact pure party politics and said its proposals were nothing but " stale recipes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering schröder is said to be willing to go some way towards conservative plan regarding tax cuts for companies , but social democratic leader franz müntefering said he wants labor rights left alone . the chancellor 's meeting with the opposition comes two years on from the launch of the agenda 2010 package of reforms to germany 's welfare , pension and health care systems and labor market . popularity boost needed ahead of election schröder 's speech is also intended to boost the waning popularity of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- ahead of the key regional election in one on germany 's key industrial areas , north rhine-westphalia , in may and a general election in 2006 . the chancellor and the spd have both taken a battering in terms of popularity of late , particularly after the introduction of labor market reforms at the start of the year which cut benefit for the long-term unemployed and made it harder for them to turn down available work . the changes have swelled the unemployment total by some 370,000 by including in the statistics people previously not counted even though they were out of work . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just do n't ask for id an initiative in germany wants to secure the basic rights of its around one million illegal immigrants .
but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .
get the bastard , madam , get the bastard .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .

he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .

" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .

bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .

over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp .
-lrb- march 10 , 2004 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

bochum have a little more oomph up front -lrb- 29 goals -rrb- but their defense has let them down also , having given up 50 goals as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.03.2005 tackling sour eu-asean relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's infineon already produces silcon wafers in singapore the european union believes trade with the countries in south east asia has a promising future .
human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .
and not just for the individual countries .
environmental matters have become cross-boundary matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smog has lain thick over indonesian cities , here jakarta , in the past as forest fires have ravaged the country " southeast asia is losing its natural forests at the fastest pace .
the negative consequences are of global dimensions , which means they affect us , " reads the german foreign office 's assessment of the situation , which goes on to say that the country with the most forestland , indonesia , must pay particular attention to the issue .
but the eu can not put the cart in front of the horse .
in order to have any influence over the environmental policies of asean members , it must first create a friendly political climate .
otherwise , " made in asia " may not only be a symbol for the economic boom of the continent , but also for environmental disasters . martin schrader -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asem summit starts amid myanmar discord topics such as terrorism and trade are high on the agenda during the two-day asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- in hanoi .

" the information and communication industry has become an important growth engine for germany and the global economy , " schröder said .
he has hinted that his government could introduce new measures to boost the economy , but has so far not named specific project .
according to news reports , all cabinet members have been asked to come up with suggestions . it as germany 's saving grace ? the recovery of the it sector could be an important card in schröder 's hand as he attempts to pacify and convince conservative opposition leaders next week that his agenda 2010 reform plan is on track and will bring dividends in the future . after a dismal three years prompted by the collapse of the so-called new economy , the german computer , telecommunications and new media association bitkom revealed ahead of the cebit trade fair that the worst appeared to be over . " the information and communication sector is showing healthy economic growth and creating new jobs , " bitkom chief willi berchtold told reporters .
" people are delighted with modern technology again .
they are thrilled with new devices that are useful and fun . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german high-tech sales are set to rise 3.4 percent in 2005 to € 135.2 billion -lrb- $ 180.7 billion -rrb- and another 3.1 percent in 2006 , according to the group .
cebit is expected to draw 500,000 visitors and help trigger renewed excitement for the high-tech sector after the lengthy slump . chancellor to push growth-inducing measures schröder assured the executives at the cebit that everything would be done to maintain an atmosphere in which the industry could continue to prosper . " we will improve the growth dynamic with additional measures , " he said .
" i will present the concrete proposals in the german bundestag next week . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber schröder will meet with angela merkel , the leader of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on march 17 for a " job summit " to talk about strategies to tackle the nation 's record-high unemployment rate .
foreign minister joschka fischer , schröder 's vice-chancellor , will also attend the talks . " we will then see whether the opposition is ready to take up its responsibility , " schröder told the trade fair audience . disagreement going in but signs of compromise between the government and the opposition are hard to find .
in a debate in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , both sides again expressed their willingness to continue reforming the german economy and to attend next week 's " job summit " with an open mind .
but the agreement basically ends there . the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected the ten-point program by the conservatives aimed at reducing unemployment that is part of the opposition 's so-called " pact for germany . "
it would cut unemployment insurance premiums , make firing employees easier , cut bureaucracy and loosen some rules around industry-wide wage contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of the bundestag on thursday in the bundestag on thursday , christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader angela merkel said that with the plan , germany could be " could be lead out of its numbness " and that with 5.2 million unemployed and an expected growth rate of one percent , there was no question of simply continuing on the present course .
she said germany need far-reaching reforms . " what we definitely wo n't support is a stop-gap program aimed at stimulating the economy by making new debts , " merkel said .
" what we really need are the types of structural changes proposed in our pact for germany . " the spd and greens , however , called the so-called pact pure party politics and said its proposals were nothing but " stale recipes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering schröder is said to be willing to go some way towards conservative plan regarding tax cuts for companies , but social democratic leader franz müntefering said he wants labor rights left alone . the chancellor 's meeting with the opposition comes two years on from the launch of the agenda 2010 package of reforms to germany 's welfare , pension and health care systems and labor market . popularity boost needed ahead of election schröder 's speech is also intended to boost the waning popularity of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- ahead of the key regional election in one on germany 's key industrial areas , north rhine-westphalia , in may and a general election in 2006 . the chancellor and the spd have both taken a battering in terms of popularity of late , particularly after the introduction of labor market reforms at the start of the year which cut benefit for the long-term unemployed and made it harder for them to turn down available work . the changes have swelled the unemployment total by some 370,000 by including in the statistics people previously not counted even though they were out of work . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .

" the information and communication industry has become an important growth engine for germany and the global economy , " schröder said .
he has hinted that his government could introduce new measures to boost the economy , but has so far not named specific project .
according to news reports , all cabinet members have been asked to come up with suggestions . it as germany 's saving grace ? the recovery of the it sector could be an important card in schröder 's hand as he attempts to pacify and convince conservative opposition leaders next week that his agenda 2010 reform plan is on track and will bring dividends in the future . after a dismal three years prompted by the collapse of the so-called new economy , the german computer , telecommunications and new media association bitkom revealed ahead of the cebit trade fair that the worst appeared to be over . " the information and communication sector is showing healthy economic growth and creating new jobs , " bitkom chief willi berchtold told reporters .
" people are delighted with modern technology again .
they are thrilled with new devices that are useful and fun . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german high-tech sales are set to rise 3.4 percent in 2005 to € 135.2 billion -lrb- $ 180.7 billion -rrb- and another 3.1 percent in 2006 , according to the group .
cebit is expected to draw 500,000 visitors and help trigger renewed excitement for the high-tech sector after the lengthy slump . chancellor to push growth-inducing measures schröder assured the executives at the cebit that everything would be done to maintain an atmosphere in which the industry could continue to prosper . " we will improve the growth dynamic with additional measures , " he said .
" i will present the concrete proposals in the german bundestag next week . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber schröder will meet with angela merkel , the leader of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , and edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on march 17 for a " job summit " to talk about strategies to tackle the nation 's record-high unemployment rate .
foreign minister joschka fischer , schröder 's vice-chancellor , will also attend the talks . " we will then see whether the opposition is ready to take up its responsibility , " schröder told the trade fair audience . disagreement going in but signs of compromise between the government and the opposition are hard to find .
in a debate in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , on thursday , both sides again expressed their willingness to continue reforming the german economy and to attend next week 's " job summit " with an open mind .
but the agreement basically ends there . the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected the ten-point program by the conservatives aimed at reducing unemployment that is part of the opposition 's so-called " pact for germany . "
it would cut unemployment insurance premiums , make firing employees easier , cut bureaucracy and loosen some rules around industry-wide wage contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of the bundestag on thursday in the bundestag on thursday , christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader angela merkel said that with the plan , germany could be " could be lead out of its numbness " and that with 5.2 million unemployed and an expected growth rate of one percent , there was no question of simply continuing on the present course .
she said germany need far-reaching reforms . " what we definitely wo n't support is a stop-gap program aimed at stimulating the economy by making new debts , " merkel said .
" what we really need are the types of structural changes proposed in our pact for germany . " the spd and greens , however , called the so-called pact pure party politics and said its proposals were nothing but " stale recipes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering schröder is said to be willing to go some way towards conservative plan regarding tax cuts for companies , but social democratic leader franz müntefering said he wants labor rights left alone . the chancellor 's meeting with the opposition comes two years on from the launch of the agenda 2010 package of reforms to germany 's welfare , pension and health care systems and labor market . popularity boost needed ahead of election schröder 's speech is also intended to boost the waning popularity of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- ahead of the key regional election in one on germany 's key industrial areas , north rhine-westphalia , in may and a general election in 2006 . the chancellor and the spd have both taken a battering in terms of popularity of late , particularly after the introduction of labor market reforms at the start of the year which cut benefit for the long-term unemployed and made it harder for them to turn down available work . the changes have swelled the unemployment total by some 370,000 by including in the statistics people previously not counted even though they were out of work . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .
the minister has so far yet to yield but docking continues to hope for a quick and unbureaucratic solution . heike zeigler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawyers of bremen taliban go to u.s. supreme court the american lawyers of murat kurnaz , a turkish national from bremen who is being held by the us in guantanamo bay as an alleged taliban fighter , have appealed to the u.s. supreme court . -lrb- april 7 , 2004 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .

there has been lots of talk coming from both sides before this match - mind games to psyche out the opponent .
munich 's vice president , karl-heinz rummenigge , told sport-bild that bayern will always be better than schalke 04 .
and comments like those from schalke manager rudi assauer , that schalke would be the richest german team in 15 years , are cannon fodder for rummenigge .

schalke striker ebbe sand knows that no matter the outcome on sunday , the royal blues will finish the season on top .
" bayern definitely have the better players , " the danish international told kicker magazine , " but we have the better team . "
and may the better team , or better group of players if you 're a munich fan , win .

in western europe , germany included , the ukrainian revolution was receiving high praise .
the color orange had attained cult status .
but this week , the man at the center of this democratic transformation , viktor yushchenko , was received in berlin with guarded enthusiasm . petty party bickering preceded yushchenko 's appearance before the bundestag , and the domestic dispute over the visa affair cast a shadow over his visit .
friendly and well-meaning , the german government limited itself to signaling support for yushchenko 's expressed wish to form closer ties to europe .

president yushchenko has to create jobs and dependable frameworks for investors ; he has to stem the widespread corruption , and open the social perspective for the population - including the skeptics in the russian-influenced eastern part of the country .
it wo n't be easy for him .
his efforts need to be accompanied by a common european procedure and a series of sensible steps along the way . after his visit to germany , the question remains : does n't a country that so bravely rejected a corrupt government and so decisively fought for democracy deserve a more concrete offer ? relations with russia whoever is prepared to negotiate with turkey over eu membership should not , given a background of diverse historical and cultural ties , rule out a country such as ukraine .
kiev needs more than a few checks from brussels .
it needs a stable partnership and concrete help . yushchenko has already said that he will continue to regard russia as an important partner .
but he will no longer let moscow be the dominant partner .
europe can help ukraine and still maintain positive relations with the russian federation . the ukrainian people fought for freedom .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

now , one school is forging a path toward a new export : the country 's impressive classical music legacy . the franz liszt conservatory in weimar has decided to benefit from germany 's reputation as the cradle of classical music by exporting it .
german music conservatories are so well respected abroad that a good chunk of their student body is young asian musicians looking to get an education stamped " made in germany . "

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

according to the conservatory , it is the first permanent german music conservatory abroad .
starting last week , students were able to embark upon an eight semester course with a focus on piano , violin , cello , flute , clarinet , singing or directing , the conservatory said .

student fees are € 3,300 -lrb- $ 4,427 -rrb- per semester .

most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first .

student fees are € 3,300 -lrb- $ 4,427 -rrb- per semester .

" that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .

it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.03.2005 new evidence may clear bremen taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has been a prisoner in guantanamo bay since 2002 lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough . bremen resident murat kurnaz had been studying the koran at a school in pakistan when , in early 2002 , the turkish-born apprentice ship worker was snatched by pakistani special forces . the man who was soon to become known as the " bremen taliban " was arrested under anti-terrorism laws and taken from his home .
the 21 year-old 's life took a very different and harrowing direction on that day . kurnaz was handed over to the americans as part of the agreement between the united states and pakistan in their collaboration in the war on terror .
since his arrest , he has been held at the notorious camp delta in cuba 's guantanamo bay along with many other so-called enemy combatants . no evidence of terror links , says lawyer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but recently acquired evidence may help the efforts to release kurnaz .
the american lawyer baher azmy revealed to the german press on wednesday that previously confidential papers relating to the case show that the united states government has kept kurnaz imprisoned despite knowing for the best part of three years that he had no connections with any terrorist group . " these -lrb- papers -rrb- point to the fact that the us government , for many years , has known that kurnaz has neither connections with al-qaeda or the taliban or with terrorism in general , " azmy told reporters in bremen . these revelations back up a similar judgment made by the federal high court judge joyce hens green in january of this year .
out of the 50 cases she has been dealing with , the kurnaz case has stood out . hens green said at the time that there was presently no evidence that linked kurnaz with any terrorist organization or proved that he had any intent to commit a terrorist act .
she concluded that there was no judicial basis for holding kurnaz in custody without end . mistreatment claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baher azmy has visited kurnaz twice during the last few months and has described him as a peaceful and pensive person who , in azmy 's opinion , has had nothing to do with terrorism . however , despite the american legal professor 's assessment of the imprisoned bremen taliban , kurnaz is still suffering from the conditions enforced on him in guantanamo bay .
after refusing to cooperate with the military personnel in the camp , kurnaz had his food rations stopped .
he also claims that he has been sexually humiliated in interrogation rooms by female officers . " on two occasions , women in bikinis have tried to touch and excite him , " azmy told the reporters .
when he tried to protect himself , soldiers came and beat him in his cell , the lawyer added . german government called on for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hall , bremen .
azmy is just one of the lawyers who have called on the german government to take over the responsibility for the kurnaz case .
so far , nothing has been done on the grounds that , while kurnaz was brought up in bremen , he holds turkish nationality . " the intervention by the german government in the case of murat kurnaz is not only necessary but should be considered under the law of human rights , " says bremen lawyer bernhard docking , a supporter of federal involvement .
" the german government is not obliged to do anything but they could .
and it this we call for . " the governments of britain and france have successfully lobbied for their guantanamo prisoners to be returned to home soil .
only a few days ago , three french detainees were given the green light to leave camp delta for france . but docking fears that even if kurnaz is released , he may not be allowed back to bremen .
the lawyer has been in contact with bremen interior minister thomas röbekamp about the possibility of letting kurnaz return to the city if he is released .

now , one school is forging a path toward a new export : the country 's impressive classical music legacy . the franz liszt conservatory in weimar has decided to benefit from germany 's reputation as the cradle of classical music by exporting it .
german music conservatories are so well respected abroad that a good chunk of their student body is young asian musicians looking to get an education stamped " made in germany . "
" german music is very highly valued in south korea , " christian thimme , the department chair for german technical colleges at the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad , -rrb- told ap news service . high demand some 30 to 40 percent of students at german conservatories are from countries other than germany .
each year , around 7,000 young musicians from south korea apply to study in germany , but only 6 percent of them are accepted , the daad said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian pianist and composer franz von liszt given these figures , the franz liszt music conservatory in weimar came up with the idea to open a branch of its music school in south korea .
this week , it signed a contract with kangnam university in seoul .
according to the conservatory , it is the first permanent german music conservatory abroad .
starting last week , students were able to embark upon an eight semester course with a focus on piano , violin , cello , flute , clarinet , singing or directing , the conservatory said .
result : bachelor 's degree classes will be taught in german and korean , with teachers from both countries .
upon completing the course , students will be awarded a bachelor 's degree with a major in music , which will be recognized in korea and germany .
student fees are € 3,300 -lrb- $ 4,427 -rrb- per semester .
a spokesman for the liszt conservatory in weimar said he expects high demand from within korea .
the project was initially funded with contributions equalling € 530,000 -lrb- $ 707,000 -rrb- from the daad , the german ministry for education and research , the ministry of culture of the state of thuringia , and the franz liszt conservatory in weimar .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .

human rights questions , however , are throwing a wrench in attempts to improve political and economic relations . the 21st century was to be the asian century , one in which the countries ranging from india to the southeastern asian states and lastly to china , were to dominate .
this is an assessment that marco bünte from hamburg 's institute for asian affairs still holds to be true .
" asia is the largest growing region in the world and it will remain this way , " he said .
" plus it has the largest population .
that 's why it will be the asian century . "
china naturally leads the way economically , but the association of south east asian states , asean , also plays a large role in the far east .
over 500 million people live in the ten member states : brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand , vietnam , laos , myanmar and cambodia .
companies from the eu are increasing their presence there .
according to statistics from the german foreign office , asean is the eu 's second-largest market and third-largest trading partner in asia .
in addition , the eu is the second-largest investor in asean .
eu seeks stronger ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president of the eu council jean asselborn is in jakarta to patch up strained ties between the eu and asean strengthening ties to the tiger states and the newly industrializing countries that make up asean will be one of the more daunting tasks of jean asselborn , foreign minister of luxembourg , which currently holds the eu presidency , during his current trip to the region .
he is in jakarta to participate in an asean ministers meeting that began thursday .
official ministerial relations between the eu and the association exist since 1978 , the oldest regional partner the eu has , but a number of issues have strained ties recently .
bünte said the largest problem can be summed up in one word : myanmar .
myanmar entered asean in 1997 and ever since then " there has been constant criticism from the eu . "
brussels is critical of rangoon because the military leaders have done all within their means to suppress the opposition and supporters of democracy .
most importantly , myanmar 's regime continues to keep the opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner , aung san suu kyi , in custody .
" those are things that the eu , which also considers itself a community of values , can not accept , " bünte said .
how can progress be made ?
brussels firm stance on human rights questions is damaging contacts to asean .
the association makes it clear that the domestic affairs of individual states are just that and that no member state will meddle in another state 's internal affairs .
hence , the eu is constantly rebuked by the association for its criticism .
in return , brussels covers it ears .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the detention of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi is a bone of contention between the eu and asean the matter may reach a head in 2006 , however , when myanmar assumes the presidency of asean .
bünte said he thinks that then communications between the two may break down completely .
" the eu , in my opinion , will not sit at the same table as myanmar , " he said .
european companies are looking for a political thaw between the eu and asean to improve their position in the southeastern asian market .
in the recent past , countries like thailand , the philippines , and indonesia have signed free-trade agreements .
while countries like the usa and japan , even new zealand and china have benefited , the eu has been left out in the cold .
bünte said the ink has dried to a whole series of trade agreements but no eu country is amongst the signatories .
in turn , opening the door to this booming market is more difficult .
environment issues also a concern as asean economies grow , damage to the environment takes on a wider scope .

on sunday , felix magath 's team faces their nearest rival , schalke 04 . the final 10 games of the bundesliga season begin saturday , but the highlight match is on sunday when league-leader bayern munich travels to gelsenkirchen to play schalke 04 , who are even on points .
there has been lots of talk coming from both sides before this match - mind games to psyche out the opponent .
munich 's vice president , karl-heinz rummenigge , told sport-bild that bayern will always be better than schalke 04 .
and comments like those from schalke manager rudi assauer , that schalke would be the richest german team in 15 years , are cannon fodder for rummenigge .
" as long as schalke is standing in the line for bank loans and bayern is in line to withdraw deposits , " the legendary bayern striker said , " i can only grin about such statements . "

schalke striker ebbe sand knows that no matter the outcome on sunday , the royal blues will finish the season on top .
" bayern definitely have the better players , " the danish international told kicker magazine , " but we have the better team . "
and may the better team , or better group of players if you 're a munich fan , win .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nuremberg 's marek mintal -lrb- left -rrb- continue to carry his team against freiburg ?
nuremberg still stand close to the relegation zone , but coach wolfgang wolf has the league 's top scorer in marek mintal -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- who single-handedly has outscored freiburg -lrb- 18 goals total -rrb- .
freiburg 's punchless attack is complemented by a defense that can best be compared to a sieve .
volker finke 's team has let in a league-high 50 goals .
bochum have a little more oomph up front -lrb- 29 goals -rrb- but their defense has let them down also , having given up 50 goals as well .
rostock won their first game under coach jörg berger last week .
now , berger believes his team can make up the ground necessary to avoid relegation .
board chairman manfred wimmer was more realistic after the victory : " it was a sign of life , nothing more . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .

now , one school is forging a path toward a new export : the country 's impressive classical music legacy . the franz liszt conservatory in weimar has decided to benefit from germany 's reputation as the cradle of classical music by exporting it .
german music conservatories are so well respected abroad that a good chunk of their student body is young asian musicians looking to get an education stamped " made in germany . "
" german music is very highly valued in south korea , " christian thimme , the department chair for german technical colleges at the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad , -rrb- told ap news service . high demand some 30 to 40 percent of students at german conservatories are from countries other than germany .

the project was initially funded with contributions equalling € 530,000 -lrb- $ 707,000 -rrb- from the daad , the german ministry for education and research , the ministry of culture of the state of thuringia , and the franz liszt conservatory in weimar .

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue . romanian-born maria came to germany 12 years ago on a normal tourist visa .
a trained technician , who was 20 at the time , she dreamed of a better life in germany .
her visa expired , but maria stayed on - without health insurance and family .
today she works clandestinely as a caretaker for elderly people in private households and lives with the fear of being discovered and deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her story , documented by the protestant missionary association in germany , is far from being an isolated one .
up to a million people in germany are estimated to be living illegally in the country .
they are people who overstay their visas , visit relatives and never return , or asylum seekers who go underground after their applications have been rejected .
they come from the balkans , russia , asia , latin america and west africa . the problem was largely ignored during the political wrangling that marked germany ’ s drafting of its first ever immigration law that came into force on jan .
1 this year .
but , now that the furor over immigration has subsided , the catholic church , which has long championed the cause of illegal immigrants , has drawn new attention to the issue . last week during its annual conference in berlin , it issued a statement , signed by more than 370 prominent personalities in germany , saying it wanted to raise public awareness of the problem . “ illegal migration is simply not a public topic in this country .
until now it ’ s only been debated behind closed doors and among fringe groups of social workers and church organizations .
that has to change , ” said jörg alt , sociologist , migration expert and head of the catholic forum on illegal immigration . a more human approach but getting more people , especially policy makers , interested in the topic is only part of the problem .
without documents and registration papers , most immigrants are cut off from even the most basic of services such as health care or education for their children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of foreign origin learn german in a frankfurt school the problem is exacerbated in germany because of a clause in the immigration law which makes it mandatory for public institutions such as schools and hospitals to pass on information about illegal immigrants to social affairs offices .
doctors , priests or social workers who helped undocumented persons access basic services risk penalization . " that 's a huge hurdle for illegal immigrants who might need urgent medical care but are held back for fear of being detected and deported , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , former justice minister and parliamentarian for the opposition liberal democrats and one of the signatories to the manifesto on illegal immigration . the group is now demanding an unambiguously worded addition to the immigration law that would strike the punishment clause for those offering humanitarian aid to illegal immigrants and secure them access to medical care , education for their children and protection from exploitation . legalization common in eu while the debate on illegal immigration in germany still centers on stressing basic rights for illegal workers , other european countries grappling with the same problem have made rapid progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police control a queue of immigrants outside the moroccan consulate in valencia , spain .
most recently , spain - a country that has overtaken germany in the past few years in attracting the largest number of immigrants to its shores - has begun offering its illegal immigrants the prospect of legalizing their status if they can show a six-month work contract or one of three months if they work in the agricultural sector . experts say that the move does n't just make life easier for those working clandestinely , but also hold obvious benefits for the host country . " countries like spain are much more pragmatic in their approach to illegal immigrants , " said karl kopp , an expert on european migration at proasyl , a group working for the rights of asylum seekers .
" the immigrants in turn pay into social and tax coffers , fill in jobs that are n't usually taken up by locals and contribute towards stemming falling birth rates . " kopp pointed out that countries like italy , greece and portugal have periodically legalized their illegal immigrants . fears about jobs but such ideas face a great deal of resistance in germany , since many people fear that an amnesty would lead a large influx of foreigners who would take away jobs from germans , no small issue in a country with an unemployment rate of over 12 percent . despite the benefits that legalization of illegal workers could bring , experts say it would n't stand a chance in germany .
" while countries like spain are already talking about legalization , in germany we first need to start a debate , " said alt . while german law forbids an amnesty for illegal workers of any kind , it 's deeply entrenched attitudes that would need changing first . " we need to do some serious catch up with our neighbors , " admitted leuthheusser-schnarrenberger . karl kopp of proasyl said germany , as a modern country , should be able to carry on a debate on immigration , but so far has not really tackled the issue .
" it 's a pity because we know that in today 's world there can be no dynamism in a society without immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2005 dealing a blow to holocaust deniers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deborah lipstadt : " the book is my voice at long last coming out " deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .
now , five years on , the us historian tells the story of her six-year legal battle in a new book . in " history on trial : my day in court with david irving , " emory university professor deborah lipstadt recounts her legal battle with david irving , the widely-read world war ii writer , and a man she called " one of the most dangerous spokespersons for holocaust denial " in her acclaimed 1993 book , " denying the holocaust : the growing assault on truth and memory . "
following the book 's publication , irving accused lipstadt of damaging his reputation as a historian .
but by the end of the ensuing libel trial - in which irving defended himself - his reputation was thoroughly skewered .
justice charles gray condemned irving , saying that he had " persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence , " and called him an " active holocaust denier … anti-semitic and racist . "
while in berlin to present her latest book , lipstadt spoke about her court victory in a dw-world interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david irving dw-world : six years of your life , a lot of effort , expense and emotion went into this libel case brought against you by david irving -lrb- photo -rrb- .
was it worth it ? deborah lipstadt : i think it was .
first of all , i had no choice .
british libel law places the onus on the defendant , so that you 're essentially , from an american perspective , guilty until proven innocent .
if i had n't fought , he would 've won by default .
he could have said that his version of the holocaust - which is that there was no central program to kill the jews , no hitler involvement , no gas chambers and in which the survivors are all liars and psychopaths - was telling the truth .
if you look back now , any time david irving is mentioned , his name is followed by some version of the adjectives " holocaust denier , " " racist " or " anti-semite . "
he 's no longer reviewed in the new york review of books , the new york times , or the times literary supplement , for example , so i think in that sense it was " worth it . " a lot of people might be tempted to label holocaust deniers as extremists that do n't need to be taken seriously .
your trial showed that this is n't the case , as irving was well-respected in some circles .
how prevalent is the threat posed to history by holocaust deniers now ? it 's a little hard to judge because with the internet , geographical borders become amorphous or porous .
i do n't think the threat is really prevalent .
i think the deniers have been dealt a very serious blow .
the main source for holocaust denial today is in the arab world , where it is very prevalent , and is almost gross in its lack of sophistication .
but i do n't think in europe it 's a major issue , because essentially , as a result of the trial , we laid waste to virtually every holocaust denial argument as they stood through 2001/2002 . in germany though , there is a debate going on , not about outright denial , perhaps , but about revisionism as we saw recently with the 60th anniversary of the bombing of dresden .
in the run-up to that anniversary , the far-right npd party tried to cast that event as a " bombing holocaust " against germans .
are you at all worried about the situation in germany ? i am worried , not about denial , but about relativism .
i 'm worried about things like the flick collection being brought to berlin , i 'm worried about dresden .
ironically , it 's david irving who is responsible for the feeling that dresden was such a crime , because his book was one of the first books on the topic early in the 1960s .
in the trial , we found that he tremendously exaggerated the number of victims .
there were even germans who were writing to him back then , trying to correct him and saying that his numbers were way out of whack .
he just ignored their comments .
dresden was a tragedy .
it 's a tragedy anytime people die , particularly civilians in a war , but inflating the horror of it was in order to make what i call immoral equivalencies .
it was in order for him to say , " well yes , maybe 80,000 people died at auschwitz from war-related privations " - which is not true , they were murdered and it was more than 80,000 - " but a quarter of a million people died in one day and one night of bombing in dresden , now that 's a real tragedy . " david irving defended himself in court , so you heard plenty from him .
you did not take the stand - why was that ? first of all , i was n't obligated to take the stand .
i offered to .
i continuously told my lawyers that i was more than willing to take the stand , that i could hold my own against this guy .
but the standard operating procedure in libel trials is not to put the author on the stand .
the author is being sued for what they wrote .
so my book was at issue .
we had to prove that what i wrote in my book was correct , and there was nothing i could add by taking the stand .
though i do have to say that for me , someone for whom keeping quiet is an unnatural act , it was terribly difficult to restrain myself and listen to a man who was spewing anti-semitism and racism . that 's where your latest book comes in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : history on trial von deborahe e. lipstadt the book is my voice at long last coming out , and it really follows three strands .
it follows our legal strategy , the historical issues - how does this man twist the truth , how does he play with the documents , and so on - and the third strand is the personal .
there was a very heavy personal element , first of all in terms of the disruption to my life , but that 's the least of it .
the most striking personal element was the encounter with survivors and children of survivors and veterans .
people would stop me as i walked into the courtroom in the morning and put pieces of paper in my hand with lists of victims ' names , and they would say , this is my evidence .
there was a day when irving was trying to argue that the allies were responsible for the people who were found in the concentration camps in germany who looked like cadavers at the end of the war , because the allies had bombed the pharmaceuticals factories and the infrastructure so the germans could n't get food and medicine to the camps .
at the end of that day , an older man walked up to me .
he had a cane , but he still had a sort of military bearing , very ramrod straight .
he said , " madam , i was in the british forces that liberated the camps .
it 's awful to hear that man blame it on us .
get the bastard , madam , get the bastard .

omar deghayes , whose family fled libya after his father was killed almost 20 years ago , has been in detention at the us military base in cuba since 2002 .
he was arrested in afghanistan on suspicion of terrorist links .
a protest is taking place outside brighton town hall where councillors are being asked to back a motion calling on the us to act on his case .
the motion in support of mr deghayes has been proposed by the green party , which wants americans to either charge him or release him back to the uk .
investigators have claimed he helped recruit young men in brighton for extremist groups , and that he was involved in the madrid bombings and the september 11 terror attacks .
mr deghayes was educated in the uk , read law at university , and later visited afghanistan and settled there .
campaigners said he moved to pakistan after the new york terror attacks to ensure his family 's safety , but was arrested .
the student 's family maintain he was peace-loving and that he used to help police by visiting muslim prisoners in local jails .

slough in berkshire has been mocked by bbc comedy the office and poet laureate john betjeman , who urged " friendly bombs " to fall on the town .
now the town centre is to get a £ 4m facelift , with works by 11 contemporary artists to adorn the high street .
the public is also being asked to judge from three plans , chosen in a national contest , to redesign the street .
' vibrant and exciting ' residents are also getting the chance to choose if funding to revitalise the town centre should be spent building a 750-seat performance space or a hi-tech library .
roger kirkham , who is managing the council 's art at the centre project , said : " over the next six weeks , we want as many people as possible to come forward and give their views on the three designs .
" it is then hoped we will be able to achieve a high street that is vibrant and exciting , and one which the people of slough will own and be proud of . "
the plans will be on show from 15 march at three locations : slough estates on buckingham avenue , slough library and queensmere shopping centre .

sixth form provision at ysgol ruabon , ysgol morgan llwyd and the maelor school may also be reduced , they said .
wrexham council has blamed the problem on a lack of understanding of previous budget allocations made to schools .
elwa said its budget increases had been above average year on year , but its new process would help " equalise funding " .
the council said the problem has been compounded by elwa requesting the repayment of £ 191,000 made to wrexham 's local education authority -lrb- lea -rrb- last year due to an accounting error . "
it 's like being pushed over a cliff without parachute " head teacher peter shaw ysgol ruabon head teacher peter shaw called the situation " a mess and very worrying " .
" there 's a big gap between the council and elwa over the way we should be funded , " he said .
" the council believes we should be getting £ 3,500 per pupil , but elwa says we only need £ 2,272 .
" unless we get more money we 're potentially facing a very serious situation .
it 's like being pushed over a cliff without parachute . "
an elwa spokesman said : " elwa is in discussions with wrexham lea about securing the repayment of funding following their over claim .
" we will , of course , ensure that we secure this reclaim in a way that safeguards the interests of learners .
" since elwa inherited the responsibility for lea funding in 2002 , it has given significant and above inflation increases year on year .
" elwa is currently implementing a new national planning and funding system -lrb- npfs -rrb- which is designed to eradicate the post code lottery for sixth form funding in wales .
" wrexham is traditionally one of the lowest funded lea 's in wales - a situation that elwa inherited .
" the npfs will start the process of equalising the funding and , by 2010 , elwa will have delivered a level playing field to sixth form funding throughout wales . "
wrexham council and head teachers are due to meet elwa 's chief executive , elizabeth raikes , at the end of april to discuss the funding problem .
