but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .

other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .
" in seven days we got more money in response to the tsunami crisis than we did for all the humanitarian appeals we issued in 2004 , " he told a us network . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid to have little economic impact several nations have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid to countries struck by the asian tsunami .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .

" that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

" i regret that it has got to this pitch , " the roman catholic cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , said , stressing that he would never have made such a comparison if he had thought it could have been open to misinterpretation . during a sermon in the city 's cathedral on thursday , the cardinal declared : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . " on friday , the co-president of the greens party , which is in coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , demanded an apology from meisner . " he must apologize to those he has offended , " said claudia roth . jewish leaders mull legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel the president of the central council for jews in germany , paul spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the cardinal had insulted the millions of victims of the holocaust and that he was considering taking the matter to court . spiegel told friday 's edition of the newspaper saarbrücker zeitung he " can not in any way understand " how anyone could compare abortion and euthanasia to the crimes of the nazis . the ecumenical movement initiative kirche was also dumbfounded . " meisner has completely lost his authority as a bishop and has publicly done a great wrong to the catholic church and to dialogue between jews and christians , " it said .
earlier the pastor of st michaelis church in hamburg , christian rüß caused outrage when he compared the children who were killed or left orphaned in the tsunami , with the victims of abortion in germany .
" people ask how god could allow this flood , " rüß said in his sermon for the flood victims , " but maybe the catholic church is right when it says ' what are you complaining about ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .
" in seven days we got more money in response to the tsunami crisis than we did for all the humanitarian appeals we issued in 2004 , " he told a us network . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid to have little economic impact several nations have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid to countries struck by the asian tsunami .

eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .

other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .

" i regret that it has got to this pitch , " the roman catholic cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , said , stressing that he would never have made such a comparison if he had thought it could have been open to misinterpretation . during a sermon in the city 's cathedral on thursday , the cardinal declared : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . " on friday , the co-president of the greens party , which is in coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , demanded an apology from meisner .

" meisner has completely lost his authority as a bishop and has publicly done a great wrong to the catholic church and to dialogue between jews and christians , " it said .
earlier the pastor of st michaelis church in hamburg , christian rüß caused outrage when he compared the children who were killed or left orphaned in the tsunami , with the victims of abortion in germany .
" people ask how god could allow this flood , " rüß said in his sermon for the flood victims , " but maybe the catholic church is right when it says ' what are you complaining about ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .

however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .

" i regret that it has got to this pitch , " the roman catholic cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , said , stressing that he would never have made such a comparison if he had thought it could have been open to misinterpretation . during a sermon in the city 's cathedral on thursday , the cardinal declared : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions .

" meisner has completely lost his authority as a bishop and has publicly done a great wrong to the catholic church and to dialogue between jews and christians , " it said .
earlier the pastor of st michaelis church in hamburg , christian rüß caused outrage when he compared the children who were killed or left orphaned in the tsunami , with the victims of abortion in germany .
" people ask how god could allow this flood , " rüß said in his sermon for the flood victims , " but maybe the catholic church is right when it says ' what are you complaining about ?

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

" i regret that it has got to this pitch , " the roman catholic cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , said , stressing that he would never have made such a comparison if he had thought it could have been open to misinterpretation . during a sermon in the city 's cathedral on thursday , the cardinal declared : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . " on friday , the co-president of the greens party , which is in coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , demanded an apology from meisner .

" meisner has completely lost his authority as a bishop and has publicly done a great wrong to the catholic church and to dialogue between jews and christians , " it said .
earlier the pastor of st michaelis church in hamburg , christian rüß caused outrage when he compared the children who were killed or left orphaned in the tsunami , with the victims of abortion in germany .
" people ask how god could allow this flood , " rüß said in his sermon for the flood victims , " but maybe the catholic church is right when it says ' what are you complaining about ?

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .
" in seven days we got more money in response to the tsunami crisis than we did for all the humanitarian appeals we issued in 2004 , " he told a us network . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid to have little economic impact several nations have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid to countries struck by the asian tsunami .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .

with the tsunami fresh in everyone 's minds , it may not take place this year either . unwilling to cancel the festivities , the cologne carnival committee has suggested staging benefit events during carnival season to raise money for victims .
member sigrid krebs rejects accusations that public partying is possibly inappropriate in the wake of the southeast-asian floods . " i do n't feel it 's a contradiction , " she said .
" our charity initiative is based on the principle that if you can party , you can donate .
if everyone donates just one euro , then we 'll raise quite a lot . " the unstoppable flow of philanthropy if they really do start reaching for their wallets , the cologne revelers will be joining the ever-expanding ranks of germany 's philanthropists . over € 60 million -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- have already been raised , with television stations competing against one another to raise as much money as possible with celebrity-studded charity galas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , a cooperation between public broadcaster zdf and the mass-circulation bild zeitung -lrb- pictured -rrb- has raised the highest figure - a staggering € 40 million , making it the most successful charity appeal on german television of all time . the down-side but as the public congratulates itself on its generosity and world leaders outbid each other with aid pledges that may or may not come good , aid organizations have warned that the media response to the tsunami might end up overshadowing other crises . while most german charities framed their aid requests so that they were not legally tied to providing specific assistance in one country , " medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- " has urged donors to stop sending money for asian tsunami victims , saying it has collected enough funds to manage its relief effort there . it now tells anyone making a donation that its tsunami program is already financed and that they can make a donation for a different crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 've asked people to send us non-specific donations because then we can plan more flexibly and invest the funds where they 're most needed , which currently includes darfur , congo and west africa , " said chairperson of its german branch ulrike von pilar , referring to ongoing crises which have left millions dead and regions ravaged - but which have attracted far less media attention . criticism it 's a position that 's facing angry criticism .
other aid organizations feel it could put the brakes on the extraordinary wave of private charity . but in fact , msf provides emergency aid rather than long-term relief .
its aid workers visit crisis regions for a limited period only .
other organizations focused on long-term development assistance stay on to help in reconstructions efforts - and these welcome the sudden increase in public and private donations . forgotten disasters every year , the german central institute for social issues -lrb- dzi -rrb- awards aid organizations seals of approval .
in an interview with deutsche welle , ceo burkhard wilke stressed the need for the public to donate to crisis regions all over the world . " i 've talked to a number of donors who are deeply concerned that africa and latin america have been put on the backburner , so they want to make sure their money goes there , " he said . " that makes sense , and does n't mean no one should donate to southeast asia .
in cases like that , there 's never enough money , " he pointed out .
" the worst thing one could do is to compare urgency at the expense of other causes . " un emergency relief coordinator jan egeland -lrb- photo -rrb- has also called on the world not to forget those in need in other parts of the world . un general secretary kofi annan agrees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

" i regret that it has got to this pitch , " the roman catholic cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , said , stressing that he would never have made such a comparison if he had thought it could have been open to misinterpretation . during a sermon in the city 's cathedral on thursday , the cardinal declared : " first there was herod , who ordered the children of bethlehem to be killed , then there was hitler and stalin among others , and today unborn children are being killed in their millions . " on friday , the co-president of the greens party , which is in coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , demanded an apology from meisner . " he must apologize to those he has offended , " said claudia roth . jewish leaders mull legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel the president of the central council for jews in germany , paul spiegel -lrb- photo -rrb- , said the cardinal had insulted the millions of victims of the holocaust and that he was considering taking the matter to court . spiegel told friday 's edition of the newspaper saarbrücker zeitung he " can not in any way understand " how anyone could compare abortion and euthanasia to the crimes of the nazis . the ecumenical movement initiative kirche was also dumbfounded . " meisner has completely lost his authority as a bishop and has publicly done a great wrong to the catholic church and to dialogue between jews and christians , " it said .
earlier the pastor of st michaelis church in hamburg , christian rüß caused outrage when he compared the children who were killed or left orphaned in the tsunami , with the victims of abortion in germany .
" people ask how god could allow this flood , " rüß said in his sermon for the flood victims , " but maybe the catholic church is right when it says ' what are you complaining about ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.01.2005 france tests " chemical castration " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment is expected to keep offenders from repeating their crime in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward . all the men undergoing the treatment are volunteers who served prison terms for sex crimes .
the government hopes that medical treatment will help stem a sharp increase in the number of sex crimes , particularly child rape . the number of people sent to prison in france for sexual offenses has multiplied dramatically over the past 20 years .
in 2004 , there were 8,200 sex offenders in prison - or 22 percent of the jail population - compared to 1,100 or five percent in 1980 .
almost a quarter of male detainees in french jails are sex offenders , and nearly three quarters of them have raped children . french justice minister dominic perben recently told french radio that experimenting with chemical treatment to curb sex crime had never been tried in france before , but if it worked , it could be something sex offenders are forced to undergo in the future , like psychological treatment . according to the minister , injections of the prostate cancer drug leuproreline and the breast cancer tablet cyproterone dampen the sex drive and inhibit erections .
but the effect wears off when the treatment stops - so this is not " chemical castration " but rather , to use the minister 's phrase , " a chemical straightjacket . " " in prison i felt free " madelaine perret is vice-president of the paris section of the prisoner help organization farapej .
she 's met a number of sex offenders during her 15 years as a prison visitor and is n't surprised that some might volunteer for treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sexual abuse scars children for life " one prisoner i used to visit told me , ' you ca n't imagine the strength of the impulse some of us feel to get close to little boys and commit acts that are completely forbidden , " ' she said .
" he said he was glad to have been arrested , and happy to be in prison .
because there were no young boys , there was no temptation and so it was in prison that he felt free . " perret stressed that many of the offenders feel helpless . " he was down for a long sentence but was frightened about offending again when he was finally released , " she said .
" he said , ' i want treatment !
i want them to put a stop to these impulses that push me , in spite of myself , to commit what i know are crimes ! " ' diminished responsibility ?
some psychologists worry that the availability of chemical treatment might make offenders feel less responsible for their behavior - after all , if it 's possible to take drugs to stop sexually assaulting children , many might feel the crime is therefore less morally reprehensible and more the result of a medical condition . psychologist and catholic prison chaplain isabelle le bourgeois has another objection .
she says more emphasis should be placed on trying to understand and treat the psychological disorder behind pedophile crime .
" until , say , 20 years ago , it was almost rather beautiful to ' love ' children -lsb- as people put it -rsb- , " she pointed out .
" it only became an offense a very short time ago .
victims dared speak about the damage it caused them and people woke up to how serious it was . " according to le bourgeois , treating sex offenders is only just beginning to prove effective . " because it 's so recent , there has n't been proper psychological analysis of the mechanisms at work , " she said .
" we 'll only really start to make progress against sex crime when we find out what 's going on in the heads of different categories of sex offender . "
the past few months have seen a series of pedophile rape trials in france .
these crimes have outraged public opinion and left it eager for action .
but while chemicals might succeed in stopping pedophiles re-offending , nothing is being done to reform the pedophile imprisoned in his own mind . john laurenson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.01.2005 the euro 's slow way east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be a while before new eu members adopt the euro the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .
eu membership does n't mean automatic euro . many europeans these days , simply take the euro for granted .
whether in paris , lisbon or berlin , purchases can be paid for with the same coins and bills .
however , somewhat less clear is how many countries actually use the common currency .
is it a . -rrb- 12 , b . -rrb- 16 or c . -rrb- 18 ? the answer : all of the above .
strange , but true . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first answer seems obvious , since there are 12 eu states which are official members of the european currency union .
but , in addition , there are four smaller states that also use the euro : andorra , monaco , san marino and vatican city .
they already used the former currencies of their bigger neighbors , like the franc or the lira , and so indirectly became members of the euro zone .
all except andorra even have permission to mint their own euro coins .
so b . -rrb- 16 is also correct . but answer c . -rrb- 18 is also perfectly acceptable .
there are two additional regions in europe , which are n't actually countries in their own right .
in one of them , kosovo , the deutsche mark was introduced by international administrators .
the other , montenegro , opted for the deutsche mark on its own .
when the deutsche mark ceased to exist , the euro automatically became the de facto currency in these areas as well . opt outs since the maastricht treaty was signed in 1992 , currency union has been one of the pillars of the european project .
a common currency is meant to aid in the free exchange of goods and services , making , for example price , comparisons easier across borders and eliminating currency risks . in theory , the member states of the eu are meant to join the currency union when they fulfill the criteria .
but three of the 15 old members have not done so , much to the dismay of the former president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , wim duisenberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg " that message is to denmark , to sweden , to the united kingdom : come and join us ! " he said on new year 's eve 2001 when presenting the new euro currency . but so far his entreaty has fallen on deaf ears .
denmark and great britain ensured that a clause was inserted in the maastricht treaty enabling them to opt out of the currency union .
a referendum in sweden showed the populace there is not interested in deserting the swedish crown .
the government found a way to " disqualify " itself from euro acceptance . chances for the newcomers ? the ten new members of the eu also " must " adopt the euro when they fulfill the maastricht criteria .
but so far , none of them has , according to a sober assessment made in october by ecb head jean-claude trichet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet " let me also use this occasion to stress again that there is no preset timetable for the enlargement of the euro area , " he said .
" in order to adapt the euro , non-participating eu member states have to achieve - and it is a necessary condition - a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence . " among the new eu states , there are large gaps between their preparedness for the euro - estonia , lithuania and slovenia riding at the front of the pack , poland , the czech republic and hungary pulling up the rear . over- and underachievers for example , estonia 's finances could make about every third eu politician from the 15 old member states green with envy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the estonians have a lot to sing about .
the estonians achieved a budgetary surplus in 2003 of more than three percent of gdp , without a deficit in sight .
the entire national debt , at 5 percent , is so low that it was n't even possible for the ecb to calculate long-term interest rates for securities . the estonian crown has been pegged to the euro for several years and , since july , the country has been a member of the european exchange rate mechanism ii , which aims to reduce exchange-rate variability and achieve monetary stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the two-year mandatory wait and without large currency fluctuations , estonia should be ready to join the euro club at the end of 2006 . those countries pulling up the rear , the czech republic , poland and hungary , have less to brag about and their finances have raised concerns at the ecb .
their budget deficits are well over the maastricht limit of 3 percent .
in fact , the czech deficit reached 12 percent in 2003 . it will be quite a while , central bankers say , until the three can start dealing in euros .
but then again , much the same was said about portugal and spain in the mid-1990s when few thought they could get their households in order . but in these cases , the desire to be early members of the euro club brought about the kind of political pressure needed to do some budgetary weightlifting and get in shape for the new common currency . johannes beck -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

stone masons have begun work to repair the 15th century window - a painstaking project in which every pane must be individually removed and restored .
as one of the largest areas of medieval stained glass in europe , the window could be worked on for up to 10 years .
the repair bill is expected to run into millions of pounds .
huge area project leader stephen mills said : " a lot of that masonary at the top is actually 600-years-old so it has done very well indeed .
" it has fallen to us - our generation - to handle this massive project .
it is very , very complicated . "
mr mills said the stone masons would be starting at the top of the window , which covers 1,680 sq ft , and working their way down .
" the whole of the front will slowly be uncovered as the project carries on , " he added , " so it will not be as you see it now for the whole eight to 10 years - if that 's how long it takes . "
the east window cost £ 58 when it was built between 1405 and 1408 , paid by the then bishop of durham , walter skirlaw .

the lake district national park authority has announced it wants to axe free guided walks .
it said the move was because they were not attracting people from all walks of life , but " middle-aged , middle-class white people " .
cumbria tourist board criticised the proposals and called on the authority to abandon them .
in a letter , tourist board chairman eric robson said : " we feel this is a short-sighted measure given that we 're about to embark on an extended open access system which it 's hoped will attract a new generation of inexperienced walkers to places like the lake district .
' everyone welcome ' " the way the proposal was presented has offended regular users of the lakeland hills and some people from ethnic and religious communities . "
the authority said it wanted to spend the money it saves on attracting ethnic minorities , disabled people and more children to meet government targets .
mr robson said the tourist board was already working with hindu , sikh and muslim community leaders in the north west about how to encourage more ethnic minorities to visit the county .
he said he wanted to emphasise that everyone was welcome in the lake district .
on tuesday , following the opposition to the proposals , the authority said it had decided to hold a special meeting next month to discuss the proposal .

environment president philip ozouf says he favours the swiss model of having all recyclable waste collected but anything else put in a pre-paid bag .
he thinks it is a good system that gives people an incentive to recycle and helps meet the costs of waste .
senator philip ozouf visited an incinerator which serves a population of 200,000 , about the same size as jersey and guernsey .
in the next few months jersey 's politicians will be asked to decide on the best way of dealing with the island 's waste , including a replacement for the incinerator at bellozanne .

on bbc radio 4 's today programme on saturday , he added : " the ira is not an isolated body , it is part of the republican movement .
the implications are essentially lack of trust and confidence between political parties paul murphy northern ireland secretary paul murphy interview on newsnight " irrespective of who knew what , irrespective of the fact that sinn fein has gone down this political road - and i believe their leaders are genuine in that - the fact that the ira has been blamed now by the chief constable for this robbery does have serious implications for the peace process .

" why should the whole of democratic society be held back because one party is so tied to criminality and terrorism that it is n't prepared to move forward , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- ira raid claims : what happens now ?

by mark devenport bbc northern ireland political editor northern ireland 's chief constable had been accused by unionists of staying silent because of political pressure .
now that hugh orde has broken his silence , he stands accused by republicans of politically biased policing .
the chief constable could not have been any clearer in pinning the blame for last month 's £ 26.5m northern bank raid on the provisional ira .
so far , the kind of hard evidence admissible in court is lacking .
as mr orde gave his opinion , his officers had no-one under arrest and no charges pending .
this has enabled republicans to repeat the ira 's denials of involvement and demand to see the police 's proof .
however , almost every other part of the local political spectrum , from the sdlp to the unionists , appears ready to concur with the chief constable 's judgement .
given that there is no shadow assembly in existence and no restoration of the executive in prospect , it is hard to know what immediate consequences will follow .
if sinn fein were in government , they could be thrown out , but it is hard to exclude someone from an institution which does not exist .
the body which monitors paramilitary activity is due to produce its next report in april .
perhaps the independent monitoring commission -lrb- imc -rrb- will be asked to make an early report concentrating on the bank raid .
last april , the imc fined sinn fein , removing £ 120,000 of the party 's annual allowances .
they would have to maintain those fines for 220 years to make up the £ 26.5m shortfall .
so perhaps we can look forward to a restored executive in the year 2224 .
obstacles unionists have called on the government to move ahead without republicans , but there are two immediate obstacles .
it is impossible to conceive london and dublin supporting a government without nationalist participation , and the sdlp have shown no great appetite for becoming nationalist " uncle toms " in a unionist-dominated executive .
moreover , the government still seems fixated on a solution which would include sinn fein and thereby deliver on the promises of complete ira disarmament and an end to ira activity .
the likeliest scenario appears to be a period in which sinn fein might - in relative terms - be cold shouldered , followed by some desultory discussions before the westminster election .
a new push might begin again in the autumn , but the prospects for progress later this year or even next spring seem bleaker than they did before christmas .
the peace process has been derailed before by controversies over colombia , castlereagh police station and the stormont spying allegations .
however , this crisis is different as it will have a direct impact on the shoppers and retailers , workers and employers , spenders and savers who will have to exchange their old northern bank currency for the new notes which are soon to be printed .
will the people who have to change their notes in the spring change their votes when it comes to the election expected in may ?
i would n't bet on it - not unless , of course , you have £ 26.5m to spare .

by mark devenport bbc northern ireland political editor northern ireland 's chief constable had been accused by unionists of staying silent because of political pressure .
chief constable hugh orde blamed the ira for the raid now that hugh orde has broken his silence , he stands accused by republicans of politically biased policing .
the chief constable could not have been any clearer in pinning the blame for last month 's £ 26.5m northern bank raid on the provisional ira .
so far , the kind of hard evidence admissible in court is lacking .
as mr orde gave his opinion , his officers had no-one under arrest and no charges pending .
this has enabled republicans to repeat the ira 's denials of involvement and demand to see the police 's proof .
however , almost every other part of the local political spectrum , from the sdlp to the unionists , appears ready to concur with the chief constable 's judgement .
given that there is no shadow assembly in existence and no restoration of the executive in prospect , it is hard to know what immediate consequences will follow .
