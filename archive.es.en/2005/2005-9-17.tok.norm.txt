according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .

turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .

" there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 german campaigning - american-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a debate turned the tide campaign theme songs , bus tours through the country , campaign call centers - if these things sound familiar , it 's because they are .
welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance .

" believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

" messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last .

as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .

lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .

oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .

the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .

midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .

although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .

according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance . " frankreich über alles " - " france above all " - reads on inscription with biting irony , a play on words transforming the title of the german national anthem . " believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

" messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 . " there are even expressions of optimism - " we will be free by christmas 1944 " - and philosophical resignation : " life is beautiful .

as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance . " frankreich über alles " - " france above all " - reads on inscription with biting irony , a play on words transforming the title of the german national anthem . " believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

goodbye forever to france and my loved one , " it says , using a common epithet for germans during the war . some inscriptions are like diary entries : " marcel is thinking of simone and kiki ; " " guillaume loves marianne ; " " i can not sleep for thinking about by parents and my beloved louisette . " messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 . " there are even expressions of optimism - " we will be free by christmas 1944 " - and philosophical resignation : " life is beautiful . " the walls were also common ground for the barely literate and the highly cultivated , such as yvette marie-jo wilbort who dared not to imagine that she would live to see the war 's end .
she quoted from memory , an epitaph for herself , a verse from a poem by alfred de vigny . " wailing , pleading , crying - these are the coward 's call , " she wrote .
" assume your heavy and onerous burden , the one that fate has cast your way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 tapping immigrants ' educational potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hertie funds afford immigrant students a chance to succeed based on the principle that lack of money should never stand in the way of education , a german foundation offers children from struggling immigrant families financial aid to help them make the academic grade . germany 's federal commissioner for integration , marie-luise beck , never wastes an opportunity to lament the disappointing educational performance of young people from immigrant backgrounds . it 's a problem numerous studies can attest to .
according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 thousands of turks barred from voting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks will be disenfranchised this time round more than 20,000 turks who have become german citizens will not be able to vote in sunday 's general election because they still have a turkish passport , officials said , even as parties scrambled to woo the community . under german law , citizens may only carry a german passport .
holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance . " frankreich über alles " - " france above all " - reads on inscription with biting irony , a play on words transforming the title of the german national anthem . " believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

and yet another : " honored to be condemned by the bosh .
goodbye forever to france and my loved one , " it says , using a common epithet for germans during the war . some inscriptions are like diary entries : " marcel is thinking of simone and kiki ; " " guillaume loves marianne ; " " i can not sleep for thinking about by parents and my beloved louisette . " messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 . " there are even expressions of optimism - " we will be free by christmas 1944 " - and philosophical resignation : " life is beautiful . " the walls were also common ground for the barely literate and the highly cultivated , such as yvette marie-jo wilbort who dared not to imagine that she would live to see the war 's end .
she quoted from memory , an epitaph for herself , a verse from a poem by alfred de vigny . " wailing , pleading , crying - these are the coward 's call , " she wrote .
" assume your heavy and onerous burden , the one that fate has cast your way .
and then , like me , suffer and die in silence .

fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.
cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .

midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .

although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .

oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 tapping immigrants ' educational potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hertie funds afford immigrant students a chance to succeed based on the principle that lack of money should never stand in the way of education , a german foundation offers children from struggling immigrant families financial aid to help them make the academic grade . germany 's federal commissioner for integration , marie-luise beck , never wastes an opportunity to lament the disappointing educational performance of young people from immigrant backgrounds . it 's a problem numerous studies can attest to .
according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down but not out : bremen strikers ivan klasnic -lrb- l -rrb- und miroslav klose are disappointed in this photo but each scored against dortmund munich 's nearest challenger , werder bremen , won 3-2 in an exciting match against borussia dortmund that saw coach thomas schaaf 's side overcome two goals by dortmund 's ebi smolarek .
midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean du-ri cha of frankfurt -lrb- ctr -rrb- celebrates his last-minute equalizer against hamburg du-ri cha put a dent in the title aspirations of coach thomas doll by scoring the equalizer in the 90th minute , making up for a lapse in the 85th minute that put hamburg in the lead .
although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .
mainz still without a point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's thomas scherz wins the headball duel but did n't score last season 's biggest surprise , mainz , are now officially in crisis after losing 2-1 to stuttgart at home .
coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .
in the final saturday match in the bundesliga , arminia bielefeld and kaiserslautern treated a sparse crowd of 16,500 to a dismal match , playing a 0-0 draw . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last gasp goals as stars fight off minnows the champions league got off to a dramatic start wednesday as barcelona beat werder bremen 2-0 , while european heavyweights arsenal , ajax and benfica clinched vital late goals .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance . " frankreich über alles " - " france above all " - reads on inscription with biting irony , a play on words transforming the title of the german national anthem . " believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

and yet another : " honored to be condemned by the bosh .
goodbye forever to france and my loved one , " it says , using a common epithet for germans during the war . some inscriptions are like diary entries : " marcel is thinking of simone and kiki ; " " guillaume loves marianne ; " " i can not sleep for thinking about by parents and my beloved louisette . " messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 . " there are even expressions of optimism - " we will be free by christmas 1944 " - and philosophical resignation : " life is beautiful . " the walls were also common ground for the barely literate and the highly cultivated , such as yvette marie-jo wilbort who dared not to imagine that she would live to see the war 's end .
she quoted from memory , an epitaph for herself , a verse from a poem by alfred de vigny . " wailing , pleading , crying - these are the coward 's call , " she wrote .
" assume your heavy and onerous burden , the one that fate has cast your way .
and then , like me , suffer and die in silence .

if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness . " annan opened the three-day summit with a frank assessment of the un reform document .
" we have not yet achieved the sweeping and fundamental reform that i and many others believe is required , " annan said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 a us perspective on the german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have a better handle on the issues , says harvard 's ziblatt harvard professor daniel ziblatt compares election methods in germany and the united states and discusses attitudes on both sides of the atlantic toward the sept .
18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness . " annan opened the three-day summit with a frank assessment of the un reform document .
" we have not yet achieved the sweeping and fundamental reform that i and many others believe is required , " annan said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .
megan harris interviewed daniel ziblatt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gaging germany 's voters a mere 10 days before the german election , dw-world called voters in all corners of the country to find out how they feel about the future .

i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 a fight to the finish in cliffhanger vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no time to rest and await the result this time breaking with tradition , german chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , merkel , are frenetically canvassing for every vote , right up to the last minute before sunday 's general elections . campaigning in german elections usually winds down by friday night , allowing candidates a day to rest and voters a chance to reflect before election day on sunday . but with opinion polls indicating a tight race between the main parties this time , both chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel are zigzagging across the country , attending rallies and events and mobilizing supporters in the final hours . on saturday , both candidates headed to germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , to address crowds .
fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.
cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots . " we 're counting on a high turnout , " edgar piel of allensbach polling institute told stuttgarter nachrichten daily .

although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .

" we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.
cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots . " we 're counting on a high turnout , " edgar piel of allensbach polling institute told stuttgarter nachrichten daily .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .

the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 a fight to the finish in cliffhanger vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no time to rest and await the result this time breaking with tradition , german chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , merkel , are frenetically canvassing for every vote , right up to the last minute before sunday 's general elections . campaigning in german elections usually winds down by friday night , allowing candidates a day to rest and voters a chance to reflect before election day on sunday . but with opinion polls indicating a tight race between the main parties this time , both chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel are zigzagging across the country , attending rallies and events and mobilizing supporters in the final hours . on saturday , both candidates headed to germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , to address crowds .
fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.
cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots . " we 're counting on a high turnout , " edgar piel of allensbach polling institute told stuttgarter nachrichten daily .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .

" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance . " frankreich über alles " - " france above all " - reads on inscription with biting irony , a play on words transforming the title of the german national anthem . " believing in yourself gives one the power to resist despite the bathtub and all the rest , " reads another , a dark allusion to a preferred technique of torture practiced by the gestapo .
" do n't talk , " commands another , as if to give courage . most of the unfortunates interrogated and tortured here were later executed or deported to camps , historians say . few illusio n s the few rooms that remain from that era have been left intact : the ceiling lamp that still casts a wan , sinister light over the room ; the thick metal ring attached to the wall , to which prisoners were chained ; the barred window with a view of the interrogation chambers on the other side of the courtyard . the prisoner graffiti - written with bits of lead or pencils hidden in shirt collars , or simply carved with any sharp object at hand - is today protected by glass barriers . many of those detained here had no illusions as to their destiny . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few survived to liberation " julien .

for liberty of for death ? " reads another , still daring to hope .
and yet another : " honored to be condemned by the bosh .
goodbye forever to france and my loved one , " it says , using a common epithet for germans during the war . some inscriptions are like diary entries : " marcel is thinking of simone and kiki ; " " guillaume loves marianne ; " " i can not sleep for thinking about by parents and my beloved louisette . " messages of goodbye other parts of the walls are like bulletin boards , with messages the authors hoped would , somehow , find their way to intended recipients .
" roger : your father , your cousin and colette 's father came through here 24-5-44 . " there are even expressions of optimism - " we will be free by christmas 1944 " - and philosophical resignation : " life is beautiful . " the walls were also common ground for the barely literate and the highly cultivated , such as yvette marie-jo wilbort who dared not to imagine that she would live to see the war 's end .
she quoted from memory , an epitaph for herself , a verse from a poem by alfred de vigny . " wailing , pleading , crying - these are the coward 's call , " she wrote .
" assume your heavy and onerous burden , the one that fate has cast your way .
and then , like me , suffer and die in silence .

schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 thousands of turks barred from voting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks will be disenfranchised this time round more than 20,000 turks who have become german citizens will not be able to vote in sunday 's general election because they still have a turkish passport , officials said , even as parties scrambled to woo the community . under german law , citizens may only carry a german passport .
holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .

midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .

another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .

oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .

" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean du-ri cha of frankfurt -lrb- ctr -rrb- celebrates his last-minute equalizer against hamburg du-ri cha put a dent in the title aspirations of coach thomas doll by scoring the equalizer in the 90th minute , making up for a lapse in the 85th minute that put hamburg in the lead .
although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 tapping immigrants ' educational potential großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hertie funds afford immigrant students a chance to succeed based on the principle that lack of money should never stand in the way of education , a german foundation offers children from struggling immigrant families financial aid to help them make the academic grade . germany 's federal commissioner for integration , marie-luise beck , never wastes an opportunity to lament the disappointing educational performance of young people from immigrant backgrounds . it 's a problem numerous studies can attest to .
according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .
we 're like a big family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 german campaigning - american-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a debate turned the tide campaign theme songs , bus tours through the country , campaign call centers - if these things sound familiar , it 's because they are .
welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?
newly promoted cologne switched divisions but after three weeks they have n't left their place near the top of the first division table .
now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?
newly promoted cologne switched divisions but after three weeks they have n't left their place near the top of the first division table .
now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .

issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness .

fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .

but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots .

according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .
" germany 's long been home to young immigrants just waiting for a chance to tap their potential .
all we have to do is identify who they are and encourage them to apply to the program . " the scheme is n't restricted to pupils at high schools , known in germany as " gymnasium . " pupils at the lower-level secondary schools that are known as " hauptschule " and attended by those who did n't make the gymnasium cut , are also eligible for the funds . simple , but effective roland kaehlbrandt , who manages the hertie foundation , said he is confident the program can change lives . " this is a very simple and modest bursary but it can have major effects , " he said .
" it improves pupils ' confidence and it shows german society just how much potential the immigrant community is harboring .
it also proves to the immigrant community itself that it 's possible to be successful here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bursary is worth 5000 euros -lrb- $ 6000 -rrb- , paid to the recipients in installments of 100 euros a month .
the pupils can spend the money on learning aids such as language courses , books and newspaper subscriptions - all they have to do is submit regular evidence that it 's being invested in educational purposes . vera was also given a new computer , complete with internet access - luxuries she could never have otherwise afforded . even so , she does n't describe them as the best part of the bursary . " the best thing is the intellectual stimulation , " she said .
" i can attend seminars , and there 's an annual meeting we all get to go to .
there 's a nationwide network of grant-holders and we could n't be more different .
but that 's what makes it so special - everyone has something special to add .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

" more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last .

" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries .

more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2005 german campaigning - american-style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a debate turned the tide campaign theme songs , bus tours through the country , campaign call centers - if these things sound familiar , it 's because they are .
welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .

and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness .

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness . " annan opened the three-day summit with a frank assessment of the un reform document .

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down but not out : bremen strikers ivan klasnic -lrb- l -rrb- und miroslav klose are disappointed in this photo but each scored against dortmund munich 's nearest challenger , werder bremen , won 3-2 in an exciting match against borussia dortmund that saw coach thomas schaaf 's side overcome two goals by dortmund 's ebi smolarek .
midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean du-ri cha of frankfurt -lrb- ctr -rrb- celebrates his last-minute equalizer against hamburg du-ri cha put a dent in the title aspirations of coach thomas doll by scoring the equalizer in the 90th minute , making up for a lapse in the 85th minute that put hamburg in the lead .
although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .
mainz still without a point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's thomas scherz wins the headball duel but did n't score last season 's biggest surprise , mainz , are now officially in crisis after losing 2-1 to stuttgart at home .
coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .
in the final saturday match in the bundesliga , arminia bielefeld and kaiserslautern treated a sparse crowd of 16,500 to a dismal match , playing a 0-0 draw . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last gasp goals as stars fight off minnows the champions league got off to a dramatic start wednesday as barcelona beat werder bremen 2-0 , while european heavyweights arsenal , ajax and benfica clinched vital late goals .

both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .

ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down but not out : bremen strikers ivan klasnic -lrb- l -rrb- und miroslav klose are disappointed in this photo but each scored against dortmund munich 's nearest challenger , werder bremen , won 3-2 in an exciting match against borussia dortmund that saw coach thomas schaaf 's side overcome two goals by dortmund 's ebi smolarek .
midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .

although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .

" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 17.09.2005 a fight to the finish in cliffhanger vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no time to rest and await the result this time breaking with tradition , german chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , merkel , are frenetically canvassing for every vote , right up to the last minute before sunday 's general elections . campaigning in german elections usually winds down by friday night , allowing candidates a day to rest and voters a chance to reflect before election day on sunday . but with opinion polls indicating a tight race between the main parties this time , both chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel are zigzagging across the country , attending rallies and events and mobilizing supporters in the final hours . on saturday , both candidates headed to germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , to address crowds .
fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.
cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots . " we 're counting on a high turnout , " edgar piel of allensbach polling institute told stuttgarter nachrichten daily .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness .

" i am afraid , " one prisoner awaiting interrogation and almost certain death at the hands of the gestapo scrawled on the walls of his paris prison cell .
" never confess , " reads another defiant message etched into the plaster nearby . heart-rending words transformed by history into epitaphs , these and other messages on long-forgotten walls in the gestapo 's world war ii paris headquarters will go on exhibit for the first time ever this weekend , part of france 's annual heritage day festivities . more than 15,000 sites normally closed to the public , ranging from the national archives to the finance ministry , will open their doors to some 10 million visitors on saturday and sunday . house of horrors most of the rooms were renovated after the french interior ministry took possession of this notorious building , where hundreds , if not thousands , of resistance fighters and other hapless victims of the nazi occupation were tortured and condemned to die . it was as if france 's post-war leaders were eager to turn a page . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french victims of nazis remembered at new memorial but a few prison cells were left untouched , and the plaintiff expressions of fear and foreboding , patriotism and pride , preserved on their walls stand today as a moving testament of gestapo cruelty and human defiance .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down but not out : bremen strikers ivan klasnic -lrb- l -rrb- und miroslav klose are disappointed in this photo but each scored against dortmund munich 's nearest challenger , werder bremen , won 3-2 in an exciting match against borussia dortmund that saw coach thomas schaaf 's side overcome two goals by dortmund 's ebi smolarek .
midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean du-ri cha of frankfurt -lrb- ctr -rrb- celebrates his last-minute equalizer against hamburg du-ri cha put a dent in the title aspirations of coach thomas doll by scoring the equalizer in the 90th minute , making up for a lapse in the 85th minute that put hamburg in the lead .
although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .
mainz still without a point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's thomas scherz wins the headball duel but did n't score last season 's biggest surprise , mainz , are now officially in crisis after losing 2-1 to stuttgart at home .
coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .
in the final saturday match in the bundesliga , arminia bielefeld and kaiserslautern treated a sparse crowd of 16,500 to a dismal match , playing a 0-0 draw . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last gasp goals as stars fight off minnows the champions league got off to a dramatic start wednesday as barcelona beat werder bremen 2-0 , while european heavyweights arsenal , ajax and benfica clinched vital late goals .

fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .

midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .

although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .

coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .

fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .
polls will open at 8 a.m.

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed . " the document denounced terrorism in all forms , promoted development , backed reform of un management , called for establishment of a peace-building commission and a more effective human rights council . germany disappointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer addressed the un general assembly on thursday but critics said it was vague on many key points and left out key issues such as disarmament altogether , reflecting persistent divisions within the world body between rich and poor nations . german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed harsh criticism of the declaration ahead of the plenary session .
" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan the agreed document was a diluted version of un chief kofi annan 's ambitious plan to make the 60-year organization more representative and better able to meet 21st-century challenges .
more than 150 heads of state and government addressed the gathering but much of the real business was conducted away from the podium spotlight in sideline meetings to thrash out solutions to old disputes and fresh challenges .
issue of iran 's nuclear program undecided the pressing issue of iran 's nuclear ambitions was set to extend beyond the summit into the un general assembly , with a much anticipated speech on saturday by iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .
" we in indonesia believe that interfaith dialogue and empowering the moderates can reduce radicalism , " said the leader of the world 's most populous muslim nation . that message was echoed by jordan 's king abdullah ii who made an impassioned plea for " zero tolerance " toward those who promote islamic extremism .
" jordan wants true , moderate , traditional islam to replace fundamentalist , radical and militant islam , everywhere in the world , for every single muslim , " abdullah said .
terrorism left undefined australian prime minister john howard noted that the pervasive shadow of terrorism had become " a grim but inescapable fact " and voiced disappointment that the reform document , adopted by the general assembly on tuesday , had fallen short in addressing the terrorist threat .
the text of the document failed to establish an agreed definition of terrorism and left out a chapter on disarmament altogether - an omission branded a " real disgrace " by kofi annan . " there has been understandable criticism at the lack of language on disarmament and non-proliferation , particularly given the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists , " howard said . terrorism was put at the top of the summit 's agenda from the very first day with annan 's opening speech and then by us president george w. bush .
" the terrorists must know the world stands united against them , " bush said .
" the lesson is clear - there can be no safety in looking away or seeking the quiet life by ignoring the hardship and oppression of others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president jalal talabani the most impassioned plea came thursday from iraqi president jalal talabani -lrb- photo -rrb- who said his country was in desperate need of help to confront terrorist " forces of darkness .

according to a survey commissioned by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , some 15 percent of immigrant teenagers leave school without qualifications , compared to a drop-out rate of just 7 percent among mother-tongue germans . meanwhile , another survey - conducted by the center for political education - reveals that while over 30 percent of children with german parents graduate from high school , only a mere 15 percent of immigrant teenagers do so with them . the discrepancy frequently boils down to money .
language courses and private tuition do n't come cheap , and in 2002 , the non-profit hertie foundation set up a bursary program co-funded by local authorities , businesses and associations designed to help out families who 'd like to see their children performing better in school but who lack the funds to pay for some support . first launched in hesse , " start " is now available to 14-19-year-old pupils in 13 states , and there 's certainly no shortage of applicants . helpi n g pupils help themselves vera grebe is only 18-years old , but her life 's been far from sheltered .
after a childhood in kazakhstan , her family moved to germany when she was 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " my father died four years after we moved here , " she said .
" my mother has also had a lot of health problems , and has n't always been able to work . they both had cancer .
it was hard .
and neither of them spoke german , so i always had to go with them whenever they needed to fill out forms at city hall . " as a child , vera herself learned german with relative ease .
as she 's grown older , she 's done well in school , and attributes much of her success to the start program . today , a total of 130 pupils per year across the country get to benefit from the grant scheme , and the figure is set to rise to 350 . high sta n dards the program 's stated aim is to encourage more immigrant children to attain a high school diploma .
the sole conditions are that the applicants hail from immigrant families with proven financial difficulties , have a sturdy academic record , and a demonstrated awareness of social issues . claudia schlingermann , who coordinates the program in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , said she 's well aware how stringent the application criteria can seem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " but enough pupils can meet these criteria , " she said .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

welcome to germany 's american-influenced election campaigns . american involvement just might be the reason chancellor gerhard schröder even has a sliver of a chance in sunday 's election . his social democrats were tailing angela merkel 's christian democratic union by as many as 15 points in the months after he called for new elections last may . then schröder and merkel squared off in a tv debate , imported from across the atlantic for the first time in 2002 , and the incumbent came away the clear winner .
the spd soon climbed from just under 30 percent of the vote to 35 percent in a matter of days . the television debate , an american campaign mainstay since kennedy and nixon squared off in 1960 , has arrived in germany and been quickly mastered by schröder .
but it 's by no means the only change in german campaigning . american , and more professional cross-country bus tours , rousing party congresses , highly professionalized campaign headquarters : in shaping their candidates and message , the country 's major parties are increasingly borrowing methods fashioned and perfected in the united states , say former media advisors and analysts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , center , the main event at the green party convention " the americanization of german campaigning is , above all , a professionalization of the campaigns , " said michael spreng . in 2002 , spreng managed the conservative candidate edmund stoiber 's failed campaign bid to unseat gerhard schröder as chancellor .
the election marked the first time in germany candidates held televised debates with one another .
spreng -lrb- photo -rrb- sent an assistant to the us to research debate rules and watch videotapes of past debates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael spreng said his team watched videotapes of past us presidential debates the 2005 campaign has seen even more borrowed elements from the us .
merkel 's campaign team has set up a professional call center to handle queries from voters , and a so-called " rapid response " team that contradicts inaccuracies made by schröder in speeches or attacks on his opponent , says a cdu campaign official . going crazy for " angie " the conservatives ' party convention , held on august 21 , featured a one and a half hour performance by singers from the musical " queen " and the arrival of merkel to raucous cheers and a sea of orange placards bearing the name " angie , " a very un-german nickname given the candidate by her campaign and likely designed to broaden her appeal . " it was completely new in the party 's history , " says the official .
" almost the entire party convention was designed with show and television in mind … it was pretty modern for a conservative , white-bread party like ours . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ almost the entire party congress was designed with show and television in mind " like the party 's use of the rolling stones song " angie " at campaign stump speeches , the convention was designed to lend a little flash to a candidate who voters think of as capable , but uninspiring , says the official . " we wanted to stir up some emotions , " he says . spd gets personal the spd offered a toned-down version of their party convention last week in order to serve as a contrast to the conservatives .
campaign manager kajo wasserhoevel said the party would use grassroots methods like canvassing - that the spd first learned by watching john f. kennedy 's campaign in 1960 - in the final weeks .
but the party would continue to personalize the campaign , building on schröder 's high popularity ratings in an effort to sway voters over to his party . " we want to show his strengths , his courage in reforming the country and his work for peace , " said wasserhoevel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has built its campaign around the chancellor 's personality some critics say this type of personalization is strange in a political system where the party , not the individual , is the focal point , and they worry about a campaign future based on style , not substance . but campaign veterans like radunski say it 's the natural development in the age of television , and with a candidate as telegenic and accomplished in front of the camera as schröder . " you could call it americanization , but you could also call it a modernization , " says radunski .
" if there 's television , then you should use it . " germans more skeptical than american voters there are some things german strategists will never be able to copy .
broadcast rules restrict campaign ads to being shown only on selected channels in the evening time , sparing voters from an avalanche of campaign spots . german campaigns will also never be able to match the money shelled out by democrats and republicans .
germans typically do n't contribute to campaigns , and the 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- the spd is planning to spend and the 23 million the cdu will spend , pale in comparison to the figures spent on the other side of the atlantic . even if they had such cash , spreng says a complete adoption of american campaign tactics would be a waste of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans understand it 's part of a show " it 's never going to be as showy as in america , " says spreng .
" the voters understand it 's part of a show ... but they know not to mix more politics and show business .
the germans are more fact-based and skeptical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 17.09.2005 podolski 's problem in the bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski has had little reason to cheer with cologne bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .
now the 20-year old has a problem . lukas podolski plays with passion for the club he grew up with , fc cologne .
he wore his loyalty to the team on his sleeve by sticking with it when the side was relegated after the 2003/04 season .
he could easily have jumped ship and moved to a contender in the first league , and no one would have held it against him .
but he stayed on and - thanks primarily to his 24 goals - one year later , cologne was back in the top division .
podolski wanted to show that the team on the rhine could return to its glory days of the 1970s and 1980s .
the problem he has is that he alone must carry the team .
that might be possible in the second division but not in the top flight of german soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken -lrb- l -rrb- was also a player with great expectations borussia dortmund midfielder lars ricken -lrb- photo -rrb- , also a player with plenty of promise at the start of his career , has shown sympathy for ' prince poldi . '
after cologne lost last sunday 2-1 in dortmund , a game in which ricken found the net twice and podoloski failed to score , the 29-year-old ricken stood by the cologne striker .
" he 's the first person who has to defend himself when cologne loses .
it was a lot easier for me because i could hide behind the numerous international players on our squad , " ricken said .
too large a burden on a young man 's back expectations are high for a young standout , like ricken in the 1990s and podolski now .
ricken played on dortmund squads that shined with stars like matthias sammer , michael zorc , stefan reuter and jürgen köhler .
he scored the spectacular goal , a 30-meter -lrb- 33-yard -rrb- lob against juventus turin , that sealed dortmund 's only champions league title in 1997 and secured ricken the goal of the year award . ricken was under heavy pressure to succeed .
he never panned out and was relegated to the b-squad .
but he managed to make it back into the borussia starting squad this season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' prince poldi ' could hold court anytime with german soccer supporters lukas podolski 's success , in contrast to a midfielder like ricken , has been measured strictly by goal production .
on the german national squad , poldi has scored 10 goals in 15 matches , the best goal per game average on the team .
but in four bundesliga encounters , he has kicked just one goal .
" it does n't matter if i shoot three goals for the national team or not , the pressure is always great , " he said after the dortmund loss and in reference to his gala performance against south africa just four days before .
is success all that counts ?
on the national squad , podolski bubbles over with enthusiasm on the pitch .
but cologne coach uwe rapolder -lrb- photo , below -rrb- has expressed puzzlement over why his striker sometimes disappears from the action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe rapolder is dependent on podolski for success in cologne " i want to talk with poldi in detail about it .
if he has some kind of mental block , then he has to be frank about it .
it does n't matter what it is , it wo n't be a problem for me .
i 'll do all that i can to help .
but it will only work if he accepts help , " rapolder told kicker sports magazine .
podolski 's teammates may be part of the problem .
the squad simply does not possess the ability or character of the national team or of germany 's elite club , bayern munich .
but cologne has been adamant that podolski is best off at home .
" he is in good hands in cologne .
he plays permanently there .
on a top club like bayern , he might end up on the bench real fast if he plays poorly , " national assistant coach joachim löw told sport bild magazine .
fc cologne president wolfgang overath also stressed that a departure from cologne would not benefit podolski .
bildunterschrift : lukas podolski -lrb- white -rrb- has been covered tightly by opponents this season " we ca n't offer the financial terms -lrb- of other clubs -rrb- .
but lukas has to ask himself : can he make it without his family and friends ?
and it has to be clear to him that he wo n't be guaranteed a starting position on a top team , " overath said in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly .
to make sure that podolski understood in no uncertain terms just how badly the club wants to keep him , overath said they were prepared to draw up a 10-year contract if the player would sign .
but the question remains whether podolski would committ himself to cologne for so long , considering the team 's propensity for bundesliga relegation over the past decade . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne : new team on european block ?

germany 's foreign minister was critical . the three-day summit , which had brought together more than 170 leaders in new york , signed off on the 35-page document by acclamation , despite stubborn objections raised to the end by venezuela , cuba and belarus . " i urge all political leaders to remain personally committed in order to ensure that the decisions we have taken tonight turn into reality , " said swedish prime minister göran persson , whose country chairs the current general assembly session . us ambassador john bolton , who played a key role in the bargaining but was accused of limiting the scope of the final text , expressed satisfaction with what he said was the product of " difficult negotiations . " " the outcome document represents an important step in the long process of un reform , " bolton said .
" we can not allow the reform effort to be derailed or run out of steam . " he said the united states would work tirelessly to implement the reforms and added , " we can assure you that the american people and all peoples of the world will be watching closely as we proceed .

" germany would … have wished a document with a clearer mandate to act in many areas .
it is regrettable that no agreement could be reached on the key issue of disarmament and non-proliferation , nor on the definition of terrorism , " he said . venezuelan foreign minister ali rodriguez spoke just before the document was adopted to complain that its preparation " was confined to a small group of 32 and then an even smaller group of 15 countries . "
cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque went on the attack after the text was approved , saying , " this has been the summit of selfishness , arrogance and lies . "

ahmadinejad , who met with the british , french and german foreign ministers on thursday , is to unveil proposals saturday aimed at allaying european and us fears that tehran is developing nuclear weapons . the dominant summit theme of how to combat terrorism was taken up again friday by indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono , who called for greater international cooperation and a focus on the " true causes " of the problem .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .

turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

fittingly , it was the loss of that state 's election in may that prompted schröder to seek to bring the national poll forward by one year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accompanied by heavyweight party colleagues , the two are expected to end the race that has been dominated by the economy in the business capital , frankfurt .
schröder addressed supporters while merkel visited the ongoing frankfurt auto show -lrb- photo -rrb- , as they defended one last time their plans to jumpstart the economy and help the 4.7 million unemployed back into work . rousing the electorate merkel told an energized crowd in the former capital , bonn , that the seven-year tenure of schröder 's center-left government had been a " failure " and that his government was keeping future budget cuts under wraps to salvage its re-election bid . " we will not make false promises about how to get germany moving again , " the former physicist from eastern germany told some 5,000 supporters , many waving orange " angie " posters .
" i ask you to assure that i can become federal chancellor . " schröder , 61 , told some 10,000 supporters in the ruhr valley town of recklinghausen that merkel was incapable of assuring an economy balanced by prosperity and fairness .
" who believes that those who slept through yesterday can organize tomorrow 's future ? "
schröder , a charismatic campaigner said , referring to the conservatives ' 16 years in power under chancellor helmut kohl . a day earlier , schröder , his voice cracking after more than 100 campaign rallies , said merkel was " willing but not able " to lead the country and that only he could solve its deep-seated economic problems without putting the chief burden on the poor . " we had to explain to voters that we can only maintain our social welfare system if we reform it , " schröder said in defense of his unpopular economic reform package known as agenda 2010 . " that was a necessary process that i believe in and know to be right . " outcome uncertain on sunday , an estimated 69.1 million germans - among them 2.6 million first-time voters - will head to the polls to elect a new parliament with 3,648 candidates vying for 598 seats .

cet and close at 6 p.m. latest opinion polls show support for the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- at between 41 and 43 percent and about 8 percent for their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp . schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- came in second at 32 to 34 percent , while their junior coalition partner , the greens could take six to seven percent of the vote . it looks likely that germany will get its first female chancellor in the form of angela merkel and end the seven-year rule of schröder 's spd-green coalition .
but , merkel 's future coalition partners look anything but clear-cut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- und gregor gysi of the pds for one , the emergence of the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists who pollsters say could grab as much as up to eight percent of the vote , could skew the likely combinations leading to the possibility of a so-called " grand coalition " between the cdu and the spd . a further factor making it difficult to foresee the makeup of the future government is the large number of undecided voters - up ten million according to one estimate - who could end up swaying the election in too-close-to-call polls . " more than 20 percent of registered voters said they were undecided just days before the election - the highest rate ever before a federal poll , " the head of the independent opinion research institute infratest dimap , richard hilmer , told saturday 's die welt newspaper . the gloves are off the campaigning has taken on an overtly combative tone in recent weeks ever since schröder outperformed merkel in a televised debate earlier this month , impressing with his suave performance and media-savvy . bildunterschrift : schröder 's polished performance has since helped the spd recover lost ground and come within striking distance of the cdu - a fact that pollsters had ruled out less than a month ago . in contrast , the cdu / csu campaign has stumbled badly in past days with embarrasing wrangling over controversial finance minister paul kirchhof , whom schröder has repeatedly attacked in his speeches . high voter turnout expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollsters are expecting a high electoral turnout on sunday , more than during the last election in 2002 , in which 79.1 percent of voters cast ballots .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .

" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .

" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "

the rest of league played unexciting soccer until the final 15 minutes , when a slew of goals got bundesliga fans off their seats cheering . bayern munich , already the top bundesliga record-setters , added a new one to their tally on saturday , when they won for the 14th consecutive time .
as remarkable as the achievement is , the 1-0 victory against hanover was unimpressive .
" you have to be able to make a distinction : we were successful but played beneath our abilities , " bayern coach felix magath commented .
" it was difficult against hanover today - they played everybody in back .
after the champions league match , we just were n't fresh . "
martin demichelis , replacing an injured michael ballack , scored the lone goal in the 10th minute .
felix magath 's side were then unable to crack a solid hanover defense that , nevertheless , was ineffective against munich 's backline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down but not out : bremen strikers ivan klasnic -lrb- l -rrb- und miroslav klose are disappointed in this photo but each scored against dortmund munich 's nearest challenger , werder bremen , won 3-2 in an exciting match against borussia dortmund that saw coach thomas schaaf 's side overcome two goals by dortmund 's ebi smolarek .
midfielder johan micoud , coming under criticism of late for his uninspiring play , scored the gamewinner in the 78th minute .
the club 's striker duo , ivan klasnic and miroslav klose , found the net for their fifth and sixth goals respectively .
bremen now are the only team within striking distance of the high-flying bavarians .
hamburg stumble in last minute hamburg had been tied with bremen for second place heading into the fifth matchday .
promoted side frankfurt , with only two goals in the first four matches to their credit , traveled to hamburg with little hope of coming away with any points .
they came away with a draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korean du-ri cha of frankfurt -lrb- ctr -rrb- celebrates his last-minute equalizer against hamburg du-ri cha put a dent in the title aspirations of coach thomas doll by scoring the equalizer in the 90th minute , making up for a lapse in the 85th minute that put hamburg in the lead .
although they are now four points behind first-place bayern , hamburg have not lost a game in 15 matches .
another promoted team , fc cologne , defeated their rhineland rivals borussia mönchengladbach , 2-1 .
lukas podolski scored his second goal of the season in the 12th minute .
it was followed strike by björn schlicke that put cologne up 2-0 after 30 minutes .
but then the fans had to suffer an hour as gladbach , a feared opponent in cologne , held off the hosts ' attacks .
oliver neuville converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute , but it was n't enough .
last year 's first-leg super team , wolfsburg , further disappointed their fans by only drawing against 17th-place nuremberg , 1-1 .
markus schroth got the equalizer for nuremberg in the 88th minute .
the result was well-deserved result after wolfsburg , who had gone ahead in the 16th minute , retreated into their own end late in the match to try and hold the lead , but the strategy failed .
" my team played a poor match .
we begged for the equalizer in the second half .
you could call it bad luck because it happened so late , but to me it was quite clear that we would not win playing like we did , " commented wolfsburg coach holger fach after the game .
mainz still without a point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc cologne 's thomas scherz wins the headball duel but did n't score last season 's biggest surprise , mainz , are now officially in crisis after losing 2-1 to stuttgart at home .
coach jürgen klopp 's side won games last year in the early part of the season because teams underestimated them .
but that 's not happening this season .
the element of surprise has vanished and so has the offense , which has only scored two goals for their enthusiastic coach .
stuttgart 's giovanni trapattoni finally received his first victory as coach of the swabian club , which should quiet his critics for the time being .
in the final saturday match in the bundesliga , arminia bielefeld and kaiserslautern treated a sparse crowd of 16,500 to a dismal match , playing a 0-0 draw . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last gasp goals as stars fight off minnows the champions league got off to a dramatic start wednesday as barcelona beat werder bremen 2-0 , while european heavyweights arsenal , ajax and benfica clinched vital late goals .

not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces . " say cheese " - that 's not what germans will be hearing when they next head to a photographer for passport photographs . a new regulation orders germans applying for new passports from november to wipe the grin off their faces and instead pose with a neutral expression .
otherwise biometric scanners may not be able to accurately read their facial features , according to the federal interior ministry . in addition , those accustomed to tilting their faces to appear at their best , will have to forgo that too , and look straight at the camera . the ministry says that biometric facial recognition technology - an internationally agreed standard meant to aid the fight against terrorism and identity fraud - works best when the face is expressionless with the mouth closed . it 's not clear what effect banning beams - even if artificially produced for a photograph - might have in a country not known for spontaneous smiling . but germans dejected by the prospect of having to show glum-looking identification at international borders can take heart from the fact that they are n't alone : this week , britons in need of new passports were also told to stop smiling for the birdie . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to laugh , the german way germans are n't known as the most lighthearted folks around : getting one to laugh can seem like pulling teeth .

18 election in germany . daniel ziblatt , an assistant professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is on an election tour of several german cities from sept .
9-20 , 2005 .
the tour , coordinated by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , is held for every national election for an international group of german specialists .
dw-world spoke with ziblatt during his stop in leipzig .
dw-world : what is the level of interest in the us toward the election ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel ziblatt daniel ziblatt : it 's not very high among the american public .
there 's a lot going on now - the new orleans flood and debate about the supreme court nominations , so there 's a real focus inward and the agenda is domestic politics rather than foreign politics .
do you think the us government has a preference as to who wins ?
i think there 's a sense that the bush administration would prefer that -lrb- christian democratic union challenger -rrb- angela merkel wins .
the bush administration can probably work with anybody , but merkel wrote in an article for the washington post that -lrb- social democratic chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder does n't speak for all germans .
i think there is a sense also that the bush administration would have a slightly freer hand if merkel were in power , with regard to iran .
how would you compare german and american election campaigns ?
comparing the quality of debate to the last election in the us , i think it is very high .
there 's a really wide-ranging set of appeals made by political parties about how to combat a range of issues .
the central issue in the election is unemployment and there 's a wide range of very specific proposals and tax policies .
although the germans often complain that this is just a choice between pepsi and coca-cola , from an american perspective , there 's a different kind of debate going on in germany than there would be in the us .
how do german tv debates differ from american ones ?
one huge difference is that german debates are much less structured .
in american debates , the parties agree to the rules and they are set up in a very strict way .
german debates are wide-ranging and people can speak longer .
it 's a more natural debate .
you get a sense of who the candidates are , but people get interrupted and it leaves it more in the hands of the moderator .
television debates are increasingly important in germany , but they 're not decisive .
are tv debates going to become more common in german elections ?
i would image they are .
traditionally , the focus has been on parties in germany , but there 's increasing focus on personalities of candidates .
you 'll hear things like ' schröder looks like he 's trying to be too macho ' and ' merkel looks like a lonely person . '
it 's not as far developed as in the us , but that sort of thing makes people curious about who the candidates are and makes them want to see them in a televised debate .
would you say germans really expect change from this election ?
there seems to be this mass sense that germany 's facing a crisis - given the unemployment rate and the future demographic problems .
objectively , i 'd say german society is doing quite well .
if there really is a sense that germany is in a crisis , extreme policy proposals will be adopted rather than the best , most thought-out solutions .
the german system is designed to be incremental .
to expect that by electing a party , you can get a radical change is just going to generate disappointment .
i 've heard that there needs to be a radical break to address these problems .
the choice is between quick and gradual change .
the bundesrat -lrb- germany 's upper chamber of parliament -rrb- has been increasingly controlled by the cdu so schröder ca n't get much done .
so people think if they vote for cdu-fdp -lrb- the christian democrats and their prefered coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -rrb- that will allow reforms to get through .
will schröder be vindicated if he wins narrowly in this election ?
if that were to happen , the spd -lrb- social democrats -rrb- and greens would be in the same position of declining popularity .
if he 's received the mandate of the people , this will give him some increased support , but the political reality is that he will still be confronting the bundesrat and the challenge from the left .
so , i think schröder faces a whole set of dilemmas if he comes back into power that are n't really resolved by this vote .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .

holding dual nationality automatically disqualifies a person from german citizenship and thus the right to vote .
the only exceptions are when the second passport is from another european union country or if a citizen has obtained special permission .
the interior ministries of germany 's 16 states said this week that nearly 20,500 of the some 600,000 turkish-german voters were affected by the new rules passed by parliament five years ago and would not be able to vote sunday .
but turkish associations in germany said the figure could be as high as 50,000 nationwide .
kenan kolat , vice president of the turkish community in germany said many turks had been completely ignorant of the regulation and were n't aware that the turkish consulates in germany had continued to register them as " turkish nationals " after they had acquired german passports .
but interior ministries in several german states are not buying the argument , stressing that turks who were naturalized , were aware they could n't take on dual citizenship .
in the conservative-led southern state of bavaria alone , some 6,700 turkish-germans were believed to have two passports .
" those who vote anyway will be breaking the law , " state interior minister günther beckstein said .
turkish vote important for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians attempt to woo turkish-german voters in kreuzberg , berlin with polls showing a tight race , the turkish vote has emerged as a potentially important factor , particularly for chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners , the greens .
germany 's turks have traditionally been loyal to schröder 's party .
though the number of turkish voters may seem insignificant in an overall voting population of around 62 million , the turkish-german vote could prove crucial in the event of a close electoral outcome .
in the last election in 2002 , turkish votes came in handy when just 6,027 votes saved schröder from defeat .
it 's little surprise then that schröder - whose social democrats are strong backers of ankara 's bid to join the european union - has been actively wooing the turkish-german community in the weeks leading up to the election .
this week schröder visited the publishing house of hürriyet , one of the turkish-german community 's most influential newspapers , praising turks ' contribution to german society and stressing the importance of bringing turkey into the eu .
reflecting the spd 's attempts to attract turkish-german votes , germany 's top-selling newspaper , bild , this week splashed a photo of schröder speaking beneath a giant turkish flag and asked " will turks decide the election ? "
a survey released by hürriyet showed that 77 percent of turkish-germans plan to vote for the social democrats against just 4.8 percent for angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , who have firmly ruled out accepting turkey in the eu and offered it a so-called " privileged partnership " instead .
the greens tallied 9.2 percent versus 7.8 percent for the left party , a new alliance comprising disgruntled social democrats and former communists . the free-market liberal fdp , merkel 's preferred coalition partners , polled 1.2 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : turkish-german vote anything but certain german politicians are busy wooing turkish-germans .
but , disenchanted with both the conservatives ' anti-turkish rhetoric and the social democrats ' unpopular reforms , the group is proving politically unpredictable .

an excuse to network , meet old friends , gossip , plot and , just occasionally , get outrageously drunk and commit any number of indiscretions .
and the liberal democrats , who gather in blackpool this weekend , are , according to harmonica-playing party veteran lembit opik mp , no exception .
here is the montgomeryshire member 's guide to the best - and worst - of the lib dem party scene .
who throws the best liberal democrat parties ?
anyone but the liberal democrats , according to mr opik .
" it is all the people who want us to like them .
we do n't throw very good parties for each other , " he says .
the scotch whisky association get-together is always popular , for obvious reasons .
and financial news service bloomberg 's cocktail parties always go down well .
but the bbc end-of-conference party on a wednesday evening is the must-have invite of the week , according to mr opik . "
we all miss paddy 's story - it was always the same one , but we laughed anyway because he was the leader " lembit opik the nightmare scenario is hosting a party yourself - especially when it falls flat .
" you might be hosting a debate on sludge removal from the thames estuary and nobody shows up because there is a better event going on at the same time .
your heart sinks . "
what are the key ingredients of a good conference party ? 1 .
" good booze " - although mr opik stresses the importance of not overdoing it every night .
delegates , he notes , " are more careful these days " and you have to plan your conference season " like a military operation " .
2 .
good food - best to avoid " conference canapé syndrome " , says mr opik .
3 .
good names - " however cool delegates think they are they still want to see recognisable names from the telly and the big newspaper editors , " says mr opik .
independent editor simon kelner is hosting a debate on monday evening .
what - and who - should you avoid ?
according to mr opik , anyone suffering from what he calls " adhesive delegate syndrome " .
these are the people who stick to your side at parties and receptions , take the whole thing too seriously and " insist on telling you their plan for world peace when you are trying to get a cocktail from the bloomberg bar " .
he adds : " you have to work out who you want to network with , " says lembit , " and make sure you do n't waste their time when you see them " .
you do n't want to suffer from ads , after all .
what is the dream lib dem party guest list ?
" it would be hosted by nelson mandela .
guests might include bill clinton , robbie williams and michael douglas .
" charles kennedy would do a speech and be in charge of the barbecue serving meat and vegetarian food . "
what are this year 's hottest tickets ?
the lib dem glee club is always a popular stop-off on the party circuit .
this is where party workers and backbenchers get to send up their bosses with sketches and comic songs - a chance says mr opik to prove the " lib dems have a sense of humour " .
charles kennedy , who as usual is hosting his own drinks party for senior journalists , is never seen at the glee club , apparently - unlike his predecessor paddy ashdown who would always regale his colleagues with a funny story .
the same funny story .
" we all miss paddy 's story .
it was always the same one , but we laughed anyway because he was the leader , " says mr opik .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- un reforms receive mixed response bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 17 september 2005 , 07:30 gmt 08:30 uk un reforms receive mixed response analysis by richard black environment correspondent , bbc news website , new york " historic " to some , " outrageous " to others .
the outcome document from the un summit , formally adopted at the end of three days of talks , is a diverse piece of work - so it is perhaps not surprising that it has met with a mixed response .
the most biting criticism probably came in the closing speech by venezuela 's president hugo chavez , who described the document as being " conceived in darkness and brought forth from the shadows " .
he said his country 's concerns were ignored in the intensive three-week negotiations held immediately before the summit to thrash out a workable compromise .
but despite backing for his view from cuba and belarus , there was general applause when general assembly president jan eliasson brought down his gavel to signify adoption of the document , which , he said , " re-affirms our commitment to achieving the millennium goals by the year 2015 " .
eyes off the goals ?
reviewing the millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- on poverty alleviation , health , education and the environment in the poorest corners of the world had been the original point of this summit .
but it was always unlikely that powerful countries would allow such a gathering to be used solely for issues of poverty and development . "
on trade , the document is very disappointing " bob geldof a report commissioned in december 2004 by the us congress entitled us interests and un reform concluded that the international body was in need of change , and that it needed to take a close look at terrorism .
un secretary general kofi annan evidently agreed , setting out those two issues as priorities in his report , in larger freedom , which formed the basis for the outcome document here .
the document 's 35 pages also take in human rights , democracy , peace-building , disaster response and sustainable development .
in characteristically robust style , the irish musician and anti-poverty campaigner bob geldof described the situation as " bloody outrageous " .
" the whole point of this summit was supposed to be to review progress - or lack of it - on the millennium development goals , " he told the bbc news website , " and for it then to focus on reform - it 's a scandal . "
reducing poverty so what did the secretary general ask for , and what did he eventually get in at the end of the summit ?
on development , mr annan asked that : each developing country with extreme poverty should by 2006 adopt and begin to implement a national development strategy bold enough to meet the mdg targets for 2015 .
summit verdict : approved in full .
each developed country that has not already done so should establish a timetable to achieve the 0.7 % target of gross national income for official development assistance no later than 2015 .
summit verdict : pledges by some developed countries -lrb- notably in the eu -rrb- to achieve the 0.7 % target are " welcomed " ; no pressure on others to meet target .
the doha round of trade negotiations should fulfil its development promise and be completed no later than 2006 .
as a first step , member states should provide duty-free and quota-free market access for all exports from the least developed countries .
summit verdict : " work towards " implementing doha and duty-free and quota-free access .
hama amadou , who as prime minister of niger runs one of the world 's poorest nations , was dismissive .
" a few years ago , developed countries made some promises ; but since then , very few concrete actions were implemented , " he told the bbc .
" we have heard many nice speeches and nice resolutions , but we remain deeply sceptical .
now is the time for action , not nice speeches . "
geldof , too , was unhappy .
" on trade , the document is very disappointing , " he said .
" it 's clawed back what we did at -lrb- the g8 summit in -rrb- gleneagles . "
terrorism issue however , us president george bush won general approval for his statement that " the united states is ready to eliminate all tariffs , subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services as long as other nations do the same " - an apparent reference to the european union 's common agricultural policy .
on terrorism , mr annan 's view was that states should commit to a comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy .
the summit agreed to " condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , committed by whomever , wherever and for whatever purposes " .
at the instigation of uk prime minister tony blair , the un security council also passed a resolution here condemning terrorism " in all its forms " .
" the resolution will have no impact at all , " said kumi naidoo , a former activist with the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- who now chairs the civil society organisation civicus .
" there is no definition of terrorism ; and there is still the reality that one person 's terrorist is another person 's freedom fighter . "
of all groups active in recent times , the anc perhaps represents best the traditional dichotomous view of armed struggle .
once regarded by western governments as a terrorist group , it now forms the legitimate , elected government of south africa , with nelson mandela one of the world 's genuinely iconic figures .
" if people have no stake in society - well , as nelson mandela said in 1960 , ' all this government understands is violence ' , " said mr naidoo .
non-proliferation on nuclear proliferation , mr annan urged nuclear-weapons states to further reduce their arsenals of non-strategic nuclear weapons .
the summit 's verdict : no mention of the issue .
mr annan himself was stinging in his condemnation .
" twice this year - at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference and now at this summit - we have allowed posturing to get in the way of results , " he said in his opening address .
" this is inexcusable ; weapons of mass destruction pose a grave danger to us all . "
on peace-building , mr annan requested that member states should create an inter-governmental peace-building commission .
the summit 's verdict : adopted .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi was one of several prime ministers to applaud the decision , commenting that the new body " must show initiative in ensuring a smooth transition from ceasefire to nation-building , and to reconciliation , justice and reconstruction " . "
this commitment is as clear as it is historic " oxfam head nicola reindorp on the human rights abuses resolution on crimes against humanity , the secretary general asked that the international community should embrace the " responsibility to protect " principle as a basis for collective action against genocide , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
the summit 's verdict was that the international community has the responsibility to help protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
" this commitment is as clear as it is historic , " said nicola reindorp , head of oxfam in new york .
" today , we congratulate world leaders on agreeing their responsibility to protect civilians .
" after each genocide in the past , world leaders have said ' never again ' ; now , at last , the world has agreed that ' never again ' should mean ' never again ' , and this could help make tragedies like the rwandan genocide a thing of the past . "
on human rights , mr annan recommended that the un commission on human rights should be replaced by a smaller standing human rights council whose members would be elected directly by the general assembly .
the summit 's verdict was that the council will be created , but there was no decision on size or composition .
composition is the real issue of contention here .
the us and its allies object to the current commission because it can include nations which , in their view , have a woeful record on human rights .
but some countries object to a move which they believe is designed to exclude them from the un 's human rights hierarchy .
" we can see in advance that there is a real monopoly , a dictatorial control , " said mr chavez .
the un 's ' top table ' on reform of the un security council , mr annan 's view was that the body should be broadly representative of the realities of power in today 's world - two proposals for reform exist and member states should agree to take a decision on this important issue before the summit in september 2005 . "
we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal " indian foreign minister natwar singh on security council reform the summit 's verdict : " we support early reform of the security council in order to make it more broadly representative .
we commit ourselves to continue our efforts to achieve a decision to this end . "
regional rivalries were at least partially responsible for reluctance to extend permanent seats on the council to brazil , germany , india and japan , the so-called " group of four " .
india 's foreign minister natwar singh said the proposal had support from almost 100 other nations , and would be re-introduced to the un at some later stage .
" we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal , " he said .
on some of the issues left unresolved here , there are obvious next steps .
trade liberalisation , for example , will be discussed at the next world trade organization doha round meeting which takes place in hong kong in december .
others will be brought back to the un .
as for the millennium development goals themselves - the original purpose of all this - progress is patchy , with sub-saharan africa in particular lagging behind , and it is not at all clear that these three days of discussions have produced anything concrete to change that .

in characteristically robust style , the irish musician and anti-poverty campaigner bob geldof described the situation as " bloody outrageous " .
" the whole point of this summit was supposed to be to review progress - or lack of it - on the millennium development goals , " he told the bbc news website , " and for it then to focus on reform - it 's a scandal . "
reducing poverty so what did the secretary general ask for , and what did he eventually get in at the end of the summit ?
on development , mr annan asked that : each developing country with extreme poverty should by 2006 adopt and begin to implement a national development strategy bold enough to meet the mdg targets for 2015 .
summit verdict : approved in full .
each developed country that has not already done so should establish a timetable to achieve the 0.7 % target of gross national income for official development assistance no later than 2015 .
summit verdict : pledges by some developed countries -lrb- notably in the eu -rrb- to achieve the 0.7 % target are " welcomed " ; no pressure on others to meet target .
the doha round of trade negotiations should fulfil its development promise and be completed no later than 2006 .
as a first step , member states should provide duty-free and quota-free market access for all exports from the least developed countries .
summit verdict : " work towards " implementing doha and duty-free and quota-free access .
hama amadou , who as prime minister of niger runs one of the world 's poorest nations , was dismissive .
" a few years ago , developed countries made some promises ; but since then , very few concrete actions were implemented , " he told the bbc .
" we have heard many nice speeches and nice resolutions , but we remain deeply sceptical .
now is the time for action , not nice speeches . "
geldof , too , was unhappy .
" on trade , the document is very disappointing , " he said .
" it 's clawed back what we did at -lrb- the g8 summit in -rrb- gleneagles . "
terrorism issue however , us president george bush won general approval for his statement that " the united states is ready to eliminate all tariffs , subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services as long as other nations do the same " - an apparent reference to the european union 's common agricultural policy .
on terrorism , mr annan 's view was that states should commit to a comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy .
koizumi endorsed the new peace-building commission the summit agreed to " condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , committed by whomever , wherever and for whatever purposes " .
at the instigation of uk prime minister tony blair , the un security council also passed a resolution here condemning terrorism " in all its forms " .
" the resolution will have no impact at all , " said kumi naidoo , a former activist with the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- who now chairs the civil society organisation civicus .
" there is no definition of terrorism ; and there is still the reality that one person 's terrorist is another person 's freedom fighter . "
of all groups active in recent times , the anc perhaps represents best the traditional dichotomous view of armed struggle .
once regarded by western governments as a terrorist group , it now forms the legitimate , elected government of south africa , with nelson mandela one of the world 's genuinely iconic figures .
" if people have no stake in society - well , as nelson mandela said in 1960 , ' all this government understands is violence ' , " said mr naidoo .
non-proliferation on nuclear proliferation , mr annan urged nuclear-weapons states to further reduce their arsenals of non-strategic nuclear weapons .
the summit 's verdict : no mention of the issue .
mr annan himself was stinging in his condemnation .
" twice this year - at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference and now at this summit - we have allowed posturing to get in the way of results , " he said in his opening address .
" this is inexcusable ; weapons of mass destruction pose a grave danger to us all . "
on peace-building , mr annan requested that member states should create an inter-governmental peace-building commission .
the summit 's verdict : adopted .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi was one of several prime ministers to applaud the decision , commenting that the new body " must show initiative in ensuring a smooth transition from ceasefire to nation-building , and to reconciliation , justice and reconstruction " .
this commitment is as clear as it is historic oxfam head nicola reindorp on the human rights abuses resolution on crimes against humanity , the secretary general asked that the international community should embrace the " responsibility to protect " principle as a basis for collective action against genocide , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
the summit 's verdict was that the international community has the responsibility to help protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
" this commitment is as clear as it is historic , " said nicola reindorp , head of oxfam in new york .
" today , we congratulate world leaders on agreeing their responsibility to protect civilians .
" after each genocide in the past , world leaders have said ' never again ' ; now , at last , the world has agreed that ' never again ' should mean ' never again ' , and this could help make tragedies like the rwandan genocide a thing of the past . "
on human rights , mr annan recommended that the un commission on human rights should be replaced by a smaller standing human rights council whose members would be elected directly by the general assembly .
the summit 's verdict was that the council will be created , but there was no decision on size or composition .
composition is the real issue of contention here .
the us and its allies object to the current commission because it can include nations which , in their view , have a woeful record on human rights .
but some countries object to a move which they believe is designed to exclude them from the un 's human rights hierarchy .
" we can see in advance that there is a real monopoly , a dictatorial control , " said mr chavez .
the un 's ' top table ' on reform of the un security council , mr annan 's view was that the body should be broadly representative of the realities of power in today 's world - two proposals for reform exist and member states should agree to take a decision on this important issue before the summit in september 2005 .
we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal indian foreign minister natwar singh on security council reform the summit 's verdict : " we support early reform of the security council in order to make it more broadly representative .
we commit ourselves to continue our efforts to achieve a decision to this end . "
regional rivalries were at least partially responsible for reluctance to extend permanent seats on the council to brazil , germany , india and japan , the so-called " group of four " .
india 's foreign minister natwar singh said the proposal had support from almost 100 other nations , and would be re-introduced to the un at some later stage .
" we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal , " he said .
on some of the issues left unresolved here , there are obvious next steps .
trade liberalisation , for example , will be discussed at the next world trade organization doha round meeting which takes place in hong kong in december .
others will be brought back to the un .
as for the millennium development goals themselves - the original purpose of all this - progress is patchy , with sub-saharan africa in particular lagging behind , and it is not at all clear that these three days of discussions have produced anything concrete to change that .

the outcome document from the un summit , formally adopted at the end of three days of talks , is a diverse piece of work - so it is perhaps not surprising that it has met with a mixed response .
the most biting criticism probably came in the closing speech by venezuela 's president hugo chavez , who described the document as being " conceived in darkness and brought forth from the shadows " .
he said his country 's concerns were ignored in the intensive three-week negotiations held immediately before the summit to thrash out a workable compromise .
but despite backing for his view from cuba and belarus , there was general applause when general assembly president jan eliasson brought down his gavel to signify adoption of the document , which , he said , " re-affirms our commitment to achieving the millennium goals by the year 2015 " .
eyes off the goals ?
reviewing the millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- on poverty alleviation , health , education and the environment in the poorest corners of the world had been the original point of this summit .
but it was always unlikely that powerful countries would allow such a gathering to be used solely for issues of poverty and development .
on trade , the document is very disappointing bob geldof a report commissioned in december 2004 by the us congress entitled us interests and un reform concluded that the international body was in need of change , and that it needed to take a close look at terrorism .

" it 's clawed back what we did at -lrb- the g8 summit in -rrb- gleneagles . "
terrorism issue however , us president george bush won general approval for his statement that " the united states is ready to eliminate all tariffs , subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services as long as other nations do the same " - an apparent reference to the european union 's common agricultural policy .
on terrorism , mr annan 's view was that states should commit to a comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy .
koizumi endorsed the new peace-building commission the summit agreed to " condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , committed by whomever , wherever and for whatever purposes " .
at the instigation of uk prime minister tony blair , the un security council also passed a resolution here condemning terrorism " in all its forms " .
" the resolution will have no impact at all , " said kumi naidoo , a former activist with the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- who now chairs the civil society organisation civicus .
" there is no definition of terrorism ; and there is still the reality that one person 's terrorist is another person 's freedom fighter . "
of all groups active in recent times , the anc perhaps represents best the traditional dichotomous view of armed struggle .
once regarded by western governments as a terrorist group , it now forms the legitimate , elected government of south africa , with nelson mandela one of the world 's genuinely iconic figures .
" if people have no stake in society - well , as nelson mandela said in 1960 , ' all this government understands is violence ' , " said mr naidoo .
non-proliferation on nuclear proliferation , mr annan urged nuclear-weapons states to further reduce their arsenals of non-strategic nuclear weapons .
the summit 's verdict : no mention of the issue .
mr annan himself was stinging in his condemnation .
" twice this year - at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference and now at this summit - we have allowed posturing to get in the way of results , " he said in his opening address .
" this is inexcusable ; weapons of mass destruction pose a grave danger to us all . "
on peace-building , mr annan requested that member states should create an inter-governmental peace-building commission .
the summit 's verdict : adopted .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi was one of several prime ministers to applaud the decision , commenting that the new body " must show initiative in ensuring a smooth transition from ceasefire to nation-building , and to reconciliation , justice and reconstruction " .
this commitment is as clear as it is historic oxfam head nicola reindorp on the human rights abuses resolution on crimes against humanity , the secretary general asked that the international community should embrace the " responsibility to protect " principle as a basis for collective action against genocide , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
the summit 's verdict was that the international community has the responsibility to help protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
" this commitment is as clear as it is historic , " said nicola reindorp , head of oxfam in new york .
" today , we congratulate world leaders on agreeing their responsibility to protect civilians .
" after each genocide in the past , world leaders have said ' never again ' ; now , at last , the world has agreed that ' never again ' should mean ' never again ' , and this could help make tragedies like the rwandan genocide a thing of the past . "
on human rights , mr annan recommended that the un commission on human rights should be replaced by a smaller standing human rights council whose members would be elected directly by the general assembly .
the summit 's verdict was that the council will be created , but there was no decision on size or composition .
composition is the real issue of contention here .
the us and its allies object to the current commission because it can include nations which , in their view , have a woeful record on human rights .
but some countries object to a move which they believe is designed to exclude them from the un 's human rights hierarchy .
" we can see in advance that there is a real monopoly , a dictatorial control , " said mr chavez .
the un 's ' top table ' on reform of the un security council , mr annan 's view was that the body should be broadly representative of the realities of power in today 's world - two proposals for reform exist and member states should agree to take a decision on this important issue before the summit in september 2005 .
we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal indian foreign minister natwar singh on security council reform the summit 's verdict : " we support early reform of the security council in order to make it more broadly representative .
we commit ourselves to continue our efforts to achieve a decision to this end . "
regional rivalries were at least partially responsible for reluctance to extend permanent seats on the council to brazil , germany , india and japan , the so-called " group of four " .
india 's foreign minister natwar singh said the proposal had support from almost 100 other nations , and would be re-introduced to the un at some later stage .
" we feel after this meeting to be very confident , and plan to work very tirelessly towards our goal , " he said .
on some of the issues left unresolved here , there are obvious next steps .
trade liberalisation , for example , will be discussed at the next world trade organization doha round meeting which takes place in hong kong in december .
others will be brought back to the un .
as for the millennium development goals themselves - the original purpose of all this - progress is patchy , with sub-saharan africa in particular lagging behind , and it is not at all clear that these three days of discussions have produced anything concrete to change that .

the outcome document from the un summit , formally adopted at the end of three days of talks , is a diverse piece of work - so it is perhaps not surprising that it has met with a mixed response .
the most biting criticism probably came in the closing speech by venezuela 's president hugo chavez , who described the document as being " conceived in darkness and brought forth from the shadows " .
he said his country 's concerns were ignored in the intensive three-week negotiations held immediately before the summit to thrash out a workable compromise .
but despite backing for his view from cuba and belarus , there was general applause when general assembly president jan eliasson brought down his gavel to signify adoption of the document , which , he said , " re-affirms our commitment to achieving the millennium goals by the year 2015 " .
eyes off the goals ?
reviewing the millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- on poverty alleviation , health , education and the environment in the poorest corners of the world had been the original point of this summit .
but it was always unlikely that powerful countries would allow such a gathering to be used solely for issues of poverty and development .
on trade , the document is very disappointing bob geldof a report commissioned in december 2004 by the us congress entitled us interests and un reform concluded that the international body was in need of change , and that it needed to take a close look at terrorism .
un secretary general kofi annan evidently agreed , setting out those two issues as priorities in his report , in larger freedom , which formed the basis for the outcome document here .
the document 's 35 pages also take in human rights , democracy , peace-building , disaster response and sustainable development .
in characteristically robust style , the irish musician and anti-poverty campaigner bob geldof described the situation as " bloody outrageous " .
" the whole point of this summit was supposed to be to review progress - or lack of it - on the millennium development goals , " he told the bbc news website , " and for it then to focus on reform - it 's a scandal . "
reducing poverty so what did the secretary general ask for , and what did he eventually get in at the end of the summit ?
on development , mr annan asked that : each developing country with extreme poverty should by 2006 adopt and begin to implement a national development strategy bold enough to meet the mdg targets for 2015 .
summit verdict : approved in full .
each developed country that has not already done so should establish a timetable to achieve the 0.7 % target of gross national income for official development assistance no later than 2015 .
summit verdict : pledges by some developed countries -lrb- notably in the eu -rrb- to achieve the 0.7 % target are " welcomed " ; no pressure on others to meet target .
the doha round of trade negotiations should fulfil its development promise and be completed no later than 2006 .
as a first step , member states should provide duty-free and quota-free market access for all exports from the least developed countries .
summit verdict : " work towards " implementing doha and duty-free and quota-free access .
hama amadou , who as prime minister of niger runs one of the world 's poorest nations , was dismissive .
" a few years ago , developed countries made some promises ; but since then , very few concrete actions were implemented , " he told the bbc .
" we have heard many nice speeches and nice resolutions , but we remain deeply sceptical .
now is the time for action , not nice speeches . "
geldof , too , was unhappy .
" on trade , the document is very disappointing , " he said .
" it 's clawed back what we did at -lrb- the g8 summit in -rrb- gleneagles . "
terrorism issue however , us president george bush won general approval for his statement that " the united states is ready to eliminate all tariffs , subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services as long as other nations do the same " - an apparent reference to the european union 's common agricultural policy .

in rajasthan weddings are huge family events - so much so that to not have enough guests may be embarrassing .
to prevent this from happening an agency called the best guests centre has been set up in the city of jodhpur .
its founder , mi syed , got the idea for the agency when a friend married a woman from a different caste .
the groom 's family did not approve of the marriage , and only five guests turned up .
" i began thinking , if we could just somehow get some more people into this place , we could all have a good time together and my friend would feel good as well , " mr syed told bbc world service 's outlook programme .
" this is how i got the idea for the business . "
pretend friends the best guests agency has around 70 people on its books .
they can turn up either traditionally dressed or in smart western clothes , and are briefed on family history and pretend to be friends from the past .
mr syed explained that demand for his guests is growing because of the break up of extended families and lack of contact with relatives .
not one of my guests has ever been found out mi syed " if there are lots of guests who come to your wedding , people think you have greater influence and greater prestige in society , " he said .
" sometimes people ca n't afford to travel far , or people just do n't have enough time .
that 's when we step in . "
some of the guests for hire are students , but others are doctors , chartered accountants , and other professionals .
" you might wonder why doctors want to come , " mr syed said .
" but i suppose they do n't mind having a nice evening out , and i pay them well . "
the amount charged per guest is varied according to what mr syed described as the " level " required , and how smartly it is wished that they dress .
three categories are offered , with the highest - at around 600 rupees - being be-suited guests who are tall , well-built , light-skinned and who can converse well .
mr syed said that he has been contacted by families from far outside the state , including bangalore , calcutta and even dubai .
" my people are well-trained , " he added .
" we brief them specifically on each and every point about the family .
" the hired guests first go and spend some time with them , so that they know the style and atmosphere of the home .

three categories are offered , with the highest - at around 600 rupees - being be-suited guests who are tall , well-built , light-skinned and who can converse well .
mr syed said that he has been contacted by families from far outside the state , including bangalore , calcutta and even dubai .
" my people are well-trained , " he added .
" we brief them specifically on each and every point about the family .
" the hired guests first go and spend some time with them , so that they know the style and atmosphere of the home .
then they behave accordingly .
" that 's the reason why i 've helped in 10 marriages so far - and not one of my guests has ever been found out . "
