that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

german states are seeking their say in the belgian capital , and are consequently running the risk of making the country 's federalist constitution look as ridiculous as traditional bavarian lederhosen . bildunterschrift : the german government does n't get all the say in brussels germany , austria and belgium are the only three federations in europe , and the complex decision-making structures of the former are weakening berlin 's weight in europe . hans-peter schneider , director of the institute for federal studies says germany harms itself .
" germany is often overruled because the government constantly has to confer with its individual states , which means it does n't have the necessary flexibility for negotiations " he said .
as a result , germany often refrains from voting in brussels , so often , in fact , that abstaining from a ballot is now simply referred to as the " german vote " . federal versus state governments in addition there is a conflict of interests between the federal government as a net contributor and state governments as recipients of eu grants .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less chaos could mean more money in order to harmonize the discord , schneider says germany should do as they do in austria , where the federal states reach agreement on the topic up for vote ahead of a ballot in brussels . and it is not only politically , but economically that the wrangle between the federal and state government is hurting germany .
" we ca n't expect foreign investors to skip over to germany and sink their cash into this chaos , " said schneider . looking for reform examples while germany grapples with ways of reforming its federal system , and the heads of germany 's sixteen state governments met in berlin this week to discuss how to proceed , there is some solace to be sought in the fact other countries , such as canada and australia have struggled with the same problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's 16 state premiers meet in berlin and although there are not many examples of reforms which worked , there are no shortage of objectives .
federalism expert , fischer says that besides centralisation à la french model , canada 's " asymmetric federalism " could also serve as an example for germany . but given that many of the poorer states are not able to fulfil their duties , and considering the outrage that a redistribution of responsibilities from the " poor " to the " rich " states would unleash , such a reform suggestion will likely remain on paper . angela göpfert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal reform fails a plan to reform germany 's federal system has failed because of a dispute over control of education policy , several state premiers said on friday .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial . " that would be too clear a sign that the court believed that breach of trust is a possibility , " jürgen kurz told the tagesspiegel newspaper earlier this week . however analysts said they do n't anticipate any changes on the top floor , even if ackermann has to face another trial . " i do n't expect ackermann to resign , " fairesearch analyst dieter hein told reuters .
" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .
alongside ackermann and esser , they include mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two bothers , jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has maintained his innocence throughout the case the mannesmann board had approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover .
esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial .

" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .

esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .
there are 35 chapters - so theoretically , current members all have 35 chances to veto a new applicant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers at the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus negotiations with turkey are expected to last at least 10 years , and the most delicate chapters will be those in which the unresolved conflict on the island of cyprus plays a role .

the future foreign policy of germany ’ s new government led by angela merkel must still be agreed upon in ongoing coalition talks between the conservative union and the social democrats . merkel has made clear she wants to offer turkey a privileged partnership instead of full membership , but a turkish newspaper has reported that designated german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wants to stick to the turkey-friendly course of his former boss , outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . on november 9 , eu-enlargement commissioner olli rehn will release a progress report on turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded this year 's german booksellers ' peace prize turkish television channel ntv is already reporting that the eu will criticize restrictions on freedom of the press and opinion in turkey , as well as legal proceedings against author orhan pamuk and journalist hrant dink for making critical statements about the turkish massacre of armenians during the first world war . croatian promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of croatia , right , and the european union fly over zagreb the screening process for croatia is expected to be a shorter and easier , as its legal and economic system is better oriented towards european standards . entry negotiations with croatia could be completed in a few years , if the balkan country keeps its promise of working with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 21.10.2005 opinion : precaution or alarmism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where does responsibility stop and fear-mongering begin ?
following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial . " that would be too clear a sign that the court believed that breach of trust is a possibility , " jürgen kurz told the tagesspiegel newspaper earlier this week . however analysts said they do n't anticipate any changes on the top floor , even if ackermann has to face another trial . " i do n't expect ackermann to resign , " fairesearch analyst dieter hein told reuters .
" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .
alongside ackermann and esser , they include mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two bothers , jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has maintained his innocence throughout the case the mannesmann board had approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover .
esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

the future foreign policy of germany ’ s new government led by angela merkel must still be agreed upon in ongoing coalition talks between the conservative union and the social democrats . merkel has made clear she wants to offer turkey a privileged partnership instead of full membership , but a turkish newspaper has reported that designated german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wants to stick to the turkey-friendly course of his former boss , outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . on november 9 , eu-enlargement commissioner olli rehn will release a progress report on turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded this year 's german booksellers ' peace prize turkish television channel ntv is already reporting that the eu will criticize restrictions on freedom of the press and opinion in turkey , as well as legal proceedings against author orhan pamuk and journalist hrant dink for making critical statements about the turkish massacre of armenians during the first world war . croatian promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of croatia , right , and the european union fly over zagreb the screening process for croatia is expected to be a shorter and easier , as its legal and economic system is better oriented towards european standards . entry negotiations with croatia could be completed in a few years , if the balkan country keeps its promise of working with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .

economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .

leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial .

" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .

esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .
illiterate even in his own language , the court decided he should be refused citizenship on the grounds that he is unable to read german . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 german politicians ' promises prove hollow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough task ahead economic issues have taken center stage in german coalition talks as negotiators focus on ways to consolidate the national budget .
but new figures predict a bleak economic future and unfulfilled campaign promises . the german budget is deeper in the red than ever before .
economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax cuts this time , she says " i believe we will be forced to abide by the eu ’ s three percent deficit limit by 2007 at the latest , " he said .
" and i ’ m convinced that we can only achieve that through a massive effort to save well over 10 billion euros . "
the cdu / csu says the number should be closer to 25 billion euros .
an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .
also chancellor schröder ’ s labor market reform has turned out to be much more expensive than expected .
a crunch issue in the coalition talks is also the wholesale reduction of state subsidies .
promises broken one of the main election campaign promises of the cdu had been a reduction in corporate tax .
now angela merkel admits that this won ’ t happen .
" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .
" consolidating the national budget will be our priority which means that any cuts in state subsidies will be used for that an can not be spent on tax reduction . "
merkel says that the coalition negotiations must also come up with strategies for increasing economic growth as the only way to create more jobs .
the outlook , however , is grim , according to economic forecasts that were revised this week .
leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .
and on friday the outgoing schröder government itself was again forced to revise its figures along similar lines – reducing the expectation from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent for the coming year .
most german economists say that would be far too little and wouldn ’ t help the job market at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

the future foreign policy of germany ’ s new government led by angela merkel must still be agreed upon in ongoing coalition talks between the conservative union and the social democrats . merkel has made clear she wants to offer turkey a privileged partnership instead of full membership , but a turkish newspaper has reported that designated german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wants to stick to the turkey-friendly course of his former boss , outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . on november 9 , eu-enlargement commissioner olli rehn will release a progress report on turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded this year 's german booksellers ' peace prize turkish television channel ntv is already reporting that the eu will criticize restrictions on freedom of the press and opinion in turkey , as well as legal proceedings against author orhan pamuk and journalist hrant dink for making critical statements about the turkish massacre of armenians during the first world war . croatian promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of croatia , right , and the european union fly over zagreb the screening process for croatia is expected to be a shorter and easier , as its legal and economic system is better oriented towards european standards . entry negotiations with croatia could be completed in a few years , if the balkan country keeps its promise of working with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 21.10.2005 opinion : precaution or alarmism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where does responsibility stop and fear-mongering begin ?
following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .
there are 35 chapters - so theoretically , current members all have 35 chances to veto a new applicant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers at the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus negotiations with turkey are expected to last at least 10 years , and the most delicate chapters will be those in which the unresolved conflict on the island of cyprus plays a role .
these will be screened next year under the eu presidency of austria . austrian antagonism the alpine republic is no great supporter of turkey , after austrian chancellor wolfgang schlüssel tried - up to the last minute - to stop entry talks opening with the goal of full eu-membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign affairs minister abdullah gül is optimistic turkish foreign minister abdullah gül has said he nevertheless anticipates negotiations to proceed fairly under the austrians . two weeks ago , austria 's position was opposed by all 24 other eu members , but this might change . continued german support a further stumbling block is germany .
the future foreign policy of germany ’ s new government led by angela merkel must still be agreed upon in ongoing coalition talks between the conservative union and the social democrats . merkel has made clear she wants to offer turkey a privileged partnership instead of full membership , but a turkish newspaper has reported that designated german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wants to stick to the turkey-friendly course of his former boss , outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . on november 9 , eu-enlargement commissioner olli rehn will release a progress report on turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded this year 's german booksellers ' peace prize turkish television channel ntv is already reporting that the eu will criticize restrictions on freedom of the press and opinion in turkey , as well as legal proceedings against author orhan pamuk and journalist hrant dink for making critical statements about the turkish massacre of armenians during the first world war . croatian promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of croatia , right , and the european union fly over zagreb the screening process for croatia is expected to be a shorter and easier , as its legal and economic system is better oriented towards european standards . entry negotiations with croatia could be completed in a few years , if the balkan country keeps its promise of working with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial . " that would be too clear a sign that the court believed that breach of trust is a possibility , " jürgen kurz told the tagesspiegel newspaper earlier this week . however analysts said they do n't anticipate any changes on the top floor , even if ackermann has to face another trial . " i do n't expect ackermann to resign , " fairesearch analyst dieter hein told reuters .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 germans consider alternatives to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans want help to die or help to live ?
a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .
illiterate even in his own language , the court decided he should be refused citizenship on the grounds that he is unable to read german . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .

economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .

an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .

" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .
" consolidating the national budget will be our priority which means that any cuts in state subsidies will be used for that an can not be spent on tax reduction . "
merkel says that the coalition negotiations must also come up with strategies for increasing economic growth as the only way to create more jobs .
the outlook , however , is grim , according to economic forecasts that were revised this week .
leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .
and on friday the outgoing schröder government itself was again forced to revise its figures along similar lines – reducing the expectation from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent for the coming year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 federalism weakens germany in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu sometimes takes germany as seriously as its fantasy palace experts are warning that without reform to its federal system , germany will be both politically and economically disadvantaged on the international stage . while bavarian representation at the eu in brussels is mockingly referred to as " neuschwanstein castle " , the reality of the state 's presence there is far less frivolous than the fairytale palace .
german states are seeking their say in the belgian capital , and are consequently running the risk of making the country 's federalist constitution look as ridiculous as traditional bavarian lederhosen . bildunterschrift : the german government does n't get all the say in brussels germany , austria and belgium are the only three federations in europe , and the complex decision-making structures of the former are weakening berlin 's weight in europe . hans-peter schneider , director of the institute for federal studies says germany harms itself .
" germany is often overruled because the government constantly has to confer with its individual states , which means it does n't have the necessary flexibility for negotiations " he said .
as a result , germany often refrains from voting in brussels , so often , in fact , that abstaining from a ballot is now simply referred to as the " german vote " . federal versus state governments in addition there is a conflict of interests between the federal government as a net contributor and state governments as recipients of eu grants .
thomas fischer , a federalism expert from the bertelsmann foundation says it " presents the commission with the opportunity to play the federal and state governments off against one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less chaos could mean more money in order to harmonize the discord , schneider says germany should do as they do in austria , where the federal states reach agreement on the topic up for vote ahead of a ballot in brussels . and it is not only politically , but economically that the wrangle between the federal and state government is hurting germany .
" we ca n't expect foreign investors to skip over to germany and sink their cash into this chaos , " said schneider . looking for reform examples while germany grapples with ways of reforming its federal system , and the heads of germany 's sixteen state governments met in berlin this week to discuss how to proceed , there is some solace to be sought in the fact other countries , such as canada and australia have struggled with the same problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's 16 state premiers meet in berlin and although there are not many examples of reforms which worked , there are no shortage of objectives .
federalism expert , fischer says that besides centralisation à la french model , canada 's " asymmetric federalism " could also serve as an example for germany . but given that many of the poorer states are not able to fulfil their duties , and considering the outrage that a redistribution of responsibilities from the " poor " to the " rich " states would unleash , such a reform suggestion will likely remain on paper . angela göpfert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal reform fails a plan to reform germany 's federal system has failed because of a dispute over control of education policy , several state premiers said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 federalism weakens germany in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu sometimes takes germany as seriously as its fantasy palace experts are warning that without reform to its federal system , germany will be both politically and economically disadvantaged on the international stage . while bavarian representation at the eu in brussels is mockingly referred to as " neuschwanstein castle " , the reality of the state 's presence there is far less frivolous than the fairytale palace .
german states are seeking their say in the belgian capital , and are consequently running the risk of making the country 's federalist constitution look as ridiculous as traditional bavarian lederhosen . bildunterschrift : the german government does n't get all the say in brussels germany , austria and belgium are the only three federations in europe , and the complex decision-making structures of the former are weakening berlin 's weight in europe . hans-peter schneider , director of the institute for federal studies says germany harms itself .
" germany is often overruled because the government constantly has to confer with its individual states , which means it does n't have the necessary flexibility for negotiations " he said .
as a result , germany often refrains from voting in brussels , so often , in fact , that abstaining from a ballot is now simply referred to as the " german vote " . federal versus state governments in addition there is a conflict of interests between the federal government as a net contributor and state governments as recipients of eu grants .
thomas fischer , a federalism expert from the bertelsmann foundation says it " presents the commission with the opportunity to play the federal and state governments off against one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less chaos could mean more money in order to harmonize the discord , schneider says germany should do as they do in austria , where the federal states reach agreement on the topic up for vote ahead of a ballot in brussels . and it is not only politically , but economically that the wrangle between the federal and state government is hurting germany .
" we ca n't expect foreign investors to skip over to germany and sink their cash into this chaos , " said schneider . looking for reform examples while germany grapples with ways of reforming its federal system , and the heads of germany 's sixteen state governments met in berlin this week to discuss how to proceed , there is some solace to be sought in the fact other countries , such as canada and australia have struggled with the same problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's 16 state premiers meet in berlin and although there are not many examples of reforms which worked , there are no shortage of objectives .
federalism expert , fischer says that besides centralisation à la french model , canada 's " asymmetric federalism " could also serve as an example for germany . but given that many of the poorer states are not able to fulfil their duties , and considering the outrage that a redistribution of responsibilities from the " poor " to the " rich " states would unleash , such a reform suggestion will likely remain on paper . angela göpfert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal reform fails a plan to reform germany 's federal system has failed because of a dispute over control of education policy , several state premiers said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 germans consider alternatives to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans want help to die or help to live ?
a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 federalism weakens germany in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu sometimes takes germany as seriously as its fantasy palace experts are warning that without reform to its federal system , germany will be both politically and economically disadvantaged on the international stage . while bavarian representation at the eu in brussels is mockingly referred to as " neuschwanstein castle " , the reality of the state 's presence there is far less frivolous than the fairytale palace .
german states are seeking their say in the belgian capital , and are consequently running the risk of making the country 's federalist constitution look as ridiculous as traditional bavarian lederhosen . bildunterschrift : the german government does n't get all the say in brussels germany , austria and belgium are the only three federations in europe , and the complex decision-making structures of the former are weakening berlin 's weight in europe . hans-peter schneider , director of the institute for federal studies says germany harms itself .
" germany is often overruled because the government constantly has to confer with its individual states , which means it does n't have the necessary flexibility for negotiations " he said .
as a result , germany often refrains from voting in brussels , so often , in fact , that abstaining from a ballot is now simply referred to as the " german vote " . federal versus state governments in addition there is a conflict of interests between the federal government as a net contributor and state governments as recipients of eu grants .
thomas fischer , a federalism expert from the bertelsmann foundation says it " presents the commission with the opportunity to play the federal and state governments off against one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less chaos could mean more money in order to harmonize the discord , schneider says germany should do as they do in austria , where the federal states reach agreement on the topic up for vote ahead of a ballot in brussels . and it is not only politically , but economically that the wrangle between the federal and state government is hurting germany .
" we ca n't expect foreign investors to skip over to germany and sink their cash into this chaos , " said schneider . looking for reform examples while germany grapples with ways of reforming its federal system , and the heads of germany 's sixteen state governments met in berlin this week to discuss how to proceed , there is some solace to be sought in the fact other countries , such as canada and australia have struggled with the same problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's 16 state premiers meet in berlin and although there are not many examples of reforms which worked , there are no shortage of objectives .
federalism expert , fischer says that besides centralisation à la french model , canada 's " asymmetric federalism " could also serve as an example for germany . but given that many of the poorer states are not able to fulfil their duties , and considering the outrage that a redistribution of responsibilities from the " poor " to the " rich " states would unleash , such a reform suggestion will likely remain on paper . angela göpfert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal reform fails a plan to reform germany 's federal system has failed because of a dispute over control of education policy , several state premiers said on friday .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .

" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial . " that would be too clear a sign that the court believed that breach of trust is a possibility , " jürgen kurz told the tagesspiegel newspaper earlier this week . however analysts said they do n't anticipate any changes on the top floor , even if ackermann has to face another trial . " i do n't expect ackermann to resign , " fairesearch analyst dieter hein told reuters .
" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .

the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .

economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .

leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .

" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .

esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 21.10.2005 opinion : precaution or alarmism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where does responsibility stop and fear-mongering begin ?
following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

10 , 2005 -rrb- the westward migration of bird flu bird flu dossier : read dw-world 's collection of articles on the virus which is spreading westward , causing anxiety as it goes bird flu confirmed in greece , fears mount concerns over the spread of bird flu in europe continued to grow after a related form of the h5n1 virus was discovered in greece as consumers across europe begin losing their appetite for chicken .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .

but new figures predict a bleak economic future and unfulfilled campaign promises . the german budget is deeper in the red than ever before .
economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax cuts this time , she says " i believe we will be forced to abide by the eu ’ s three percent deficit limit by 2007 at the latest , " he said .
" and i ’ m convinced that we can only achieve that through a massive effort to save well over 10 billion euros . "
the cdu / csu says the number should be closer to 25 billion euros .
an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .
also chancellor schröder ’ s labor market reform has turned out to be much more expensive than expected .
a crunch issue in the coalition talks is also the wholesale reduction of state subsidies .
promises broken one of the main election campaign promises of the cdu had been a reduction in corporate tax .
now angela merkel admits that this won ’ t happen .
" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .
" consolidating the national budget will be our priority which means that any cuts in state subsidies will be used for that an can not be spent on tax reduction . "
merkel says that the coalition negotiations must also come up with strategies for increasing economic growth as the only way to create more jobs .
the outlook , however , is grim , according to economic forecasts that were revised this week .
leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .
and on friday the outgoing schröder government itself was again forced to revise its figures along similar lines – reducing the expectation from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent for the coming year .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 german politicians ' promises prove hollow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough task ahead economic issues have taken center stage in german coalition talks as negotiators focus on ways to consolidate the national budget .
but new figures predict a bleak economic future and unfulfilled campaign promises . the german budget is deeper in the red than ever before .
economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax cuts this time , she says " i believe we will be forced to abide by the eu ’ s three percent deficit limit by 2007 at the latest , " he said .
" and i ’ m convinced that we can only achieve that through a massive effort to save well over 10 billion euros . "
the cdu / csu says the number should be closer to 25 billion euros .
an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .
also chancellor schröder ’ s labor market reform has turned out to be much more expensive than expected .
a crunch issue in the coalition talks is also the wholesale reduction of state subsidies .
promises broken one of the main election campaign promises of the cdu had been a reduction in corporate tax .
now angela merkel admits that this won ’ t happen .
" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .
" consolidating the national budget will be our priority which means that any cuts in state subsidies will be used for that an can not be spent on tax reduction . "
merkel says that the coalition negotiations must also come up with strategies for increasing economic growth as the only way to create more jobs .
the outlook , however , is grim , according to economic forecasts that were revised this week .
leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .
and on friday the outgoing schröder government itself was again forced to revise its figures along similar lines – reducing the expectation from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent for the coming year .
most german economists say that would be far too little and wouldn ’ t help the job market at all . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel announces german cabinet after playing tug-of-war with her own party , germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , named her cabinet members on monday , ahead of coalition talks aimed at forming the new government .

" and i ’ m convinced that we can only achieve that through a massive effort to save well over 10 billion euros . "
the cdu / csu says the number should be closer to 25 billion euros .
an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .
also chancellor schröder ’ s labor market reform has turned out to be much more expensive than expected .
a crunch issue in the coalition talks is also the wholesale reduction of state subsidies .
promises broken one of the main election campaign promises of the cdu had been a reduction in corporate tax .
now angela merkel admits that this won ’ t happen .
" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .
" consolidating the national budget will be our priority which means that any cuts in state subsidies will be used for that an can not be spent on tax reduction . "
merkel says that the coalition negotiations must also come up with strategies for increasing economic growth as the only way to create more jobs .
the outlook , however , is grim , according to economic forecasts that were revised this week .
leading economists who had predicted a 1.2 percent growth for the german economy this year have corrected that to a mere 0,8 percent .
and on friday the outgoing schröder government itself was again forced to revise its figures along similar lines – reducing the expectation from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent for the coming year .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 germans consider alternatives to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do germans want help to die or help to live ?
a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 21.10.2005 opinion : precaution or alarmism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where does responsibility stop and fear-mongering begin ?
following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 speaking the language of integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german skills , now a prequisite for citizenship germany 's administrative court ruled thursday that an inability to write german may no longer be used as a reason to deny immigrants citizenship . the landmark ruling of the federal administrative court in leipzig was delivered in the case of a turkish man whose application for german citizenship was rejected because he failed german writing tests - even though 42-year-old nihat m. speaks the language fluently and has been living in the country for 27 years . a " satisfactory knowledge " germany 's new immigration legislation , which came into effect on january 1 , 2005 , says that a foreigner must possess a " satisfactory knowledge " of german in order to be eligible for a german passport .
that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 speaking the language of integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german skills , now a prequisite for citizenship germany 's administrative court ruled thursday that an inability to write german may no longer be used as a reason to deny immigrants citizenship . the landmark ruling of the federal administrative court in leipzig was delivered in the case of a turkish man whose application for german citizenship was rejected because he failed german writing tests - even though 42-year-old nihat m. speaks the language fluently and has been living in the country for 27 years . a " satisfactory knowledge " germany 's new immigration legislation , which came into effect on january 1 , 2005 , says that a foreigner must possess a " satisfactory knowledge " of german in order to be eligible for a german passport .
that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe germans move to prevent bird flu what is bird flu ?
fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds europe -pipe- 21.10.2005 opinion : precaution or alarmism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where does responsibility stop and fear-mongering begin ?
following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .
prosecutors had accused them of rubber-stamping multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago that ended with the british giant paying 178 billion euros for mannesmann . ackermann not expected to resign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , right , and esser celebrated their acquittal already a spokesman for germany 's shareholder association dsw called for ackermann 's resignation should the court order a retrial . " that would be too clear a sign that the court believed that breach of trust is a possibility , " jürgen kurz told the tagesspiegel newspaper earlier this week . however analysts said they do n't anticipate any changes on the top floor , even if ackermann has to face another trial . " i do n't expect ackermann to resign , " fairesearch analyst dieter hein told reuters .
" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now . " prosecution confident case will be reopened though ackermann has maintained that the charges against him were baseless , the prosecution is still demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for him and the five other co-defendants .
alongside ackermann and esser , they include mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel , and two bothers , jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has maintained his innocence throughout the case the mannesmann board had approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover .
esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened . " the way the case has gone so far , it looks like our appeal has been dealt a good hand , " federal prosecutor gerhard altvater told reuters . esser 's lawyer sven thomas , however , argued his client had stockholders ' - and thus the company 's - best interest in mind during negotiations of the world 's largest corporate merger of the time . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .

back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .

" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.10.2005 " the lowest of the low " no more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book exposed the grim underbelly of guest workers ' lives in 1985 , a book written by an investigative journalist forced germany to face up to its immigrant minority .
20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .

some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .

now they could be headed for a retrial . germany 's top criminal court this week fueled speculation that they could reopen the case against ackermann and former mannesmann head klaus esser concerning the bonuses they received during a merger . the federal court of justice expressed doubts as to whether the 60 million euros -lrb- $ 72 million -rrb- in payouts they approved for mannesmann executives when it was bought out by british telecom giant vodafone in 2000 were in company 's best interest . the panel of five judges heard six hours of oral arguments thursday and scheduled more for friday , but it may take weeks deliberating on the case before issuing a verdict . a lower court in düsseldorf in july 2004 found the men not guilty in on charges of breach of trust .

" there was no change in management in the first trial and i do n't expect one now .

esser alone got more than 15 million euros . though the lower court ruled that while the payouts may have been against mannesmann 's interests and possibly have broken german tax law , they did not constitute criminal action , prosecutors thursday were confident about their chances at getting the case reopened .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

the first formal phase of talks began thursday . explaining the eu 's 80,000 pages of law to candidate countries turkey and croatia and reviewing the compatibility of their legislation with eu rules marks the first step of membership negotiations known as " screening . " the aim of this in the first phase is to explain the " aquis communautaires " to the candidate countries - the eu laws , standards and legislation - and in the second phase , to have a dialogue with these countries and compare their legislation in the relevant fields , " said christina nagy , spokesperson for the european commission . " at the end of the process , the commission will prepare a so-called screening report , " she added . the european commission estimates it will take about one year to identify the loopholes and deficiencies in the laws of the candidate countries . once this is complete , entry negotiations begin in earnest and applicants must plug the gaps and demonstrate that their laws are in keeping with those of the eu .
if all 25 of the current member states are satisfied this is the case , negotiations can then be formally closed . 35 chapters the catch is that this must be done separately for each of the so-called chapters into which eu-law is divided .

the future foreign policy of germany ’ s new government led by angela merkel must still be agreed upon in ongoing coalition talks between the conservative union and the social democrats . merkel has made clear she wants to offer turkey a privileged partnership instead of full membership , but a turkish newspaper has reported that designated german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wants to stick to the turkey-friendly course of his former boss , outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . on november 9 , eu-enlargement commissioner olli rehn will release a progress report on turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded this year 's german booksellers ' peace prize turkish television channel ntv is already reporting that the eu will criticize restrictions on freedom of the press and opinion in turkey , as well as legal proceedings against author orhan pamuk and journalist hrant dink for making critical statements about the turkish massacre of armenians during the first world war . croatian promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags of croatia , right , and the european union fly over zagreb the screening process for croatia is expected to be a shorter and easier , as its legal and economic system is better oriented towards european standards . entry negotiations with croatia could be completed in a few years , if the balkan country keeps its promise of working with the hague-based international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 federalism weakens germany in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu sometimes takes germany as seriously as its fantasy palace experts are warning that without reform to its federal system , germany will be both politically and economically disadvantaged on the international stage . while bavarian representation at the eu in brussels is mockingly referred to as " neuschwanstein castle " , the reality of the state 's presence there is far less frivolous than the fairytale palace .
german states are seeking their say in the belgian capital , and are consequently running the risk of making the country 's federalist constitution look as ridiculous as traditional bavarian lederhosen . bildunterschrift : the german government does n't get all the say in brussels germany , austria and belgium are the only three federations in europe , and the complex decision-making structures of the former are weakening berlin 's weight in europe . hans-peter schneider , director of the institute for federal studies says germany harms itself .
" germany is often overruled because the government constantly has to confer with its individual states , which means it does n't have the necessary flexibility for negotiations " he said .
as a result , germany often refrains from voting in brussels , so often , in fact , that abstaining from a ballot is now simply referred to as the " german vote " . federal versus state governments in addition there is a conflict of interests between the federal government as a net contributor and state governments as recipients of eu grants .
thomas fischer , a federalism expert from the bertelsmann foundation says it " presents the commission with the opportunity to play the federal and state governments off against one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less chaos could mean more money in order to harmonize the discord , schneider says germany should do as they do in austria , where the federal states reach agreement on the topic up for vote ahead of a ballot in brussels . and it is not only politically , but economically that the wrangle between the federal and state government is hurting germany .
" we ca n't expect foreign investors to skip over to germany and sink their cash into this chaos , " said schneider . looking for reform examples while germany grapples with ways of reforming its federal system , and the heads of germany 's sixteen state governments met in berlin this week to discuss how to proceed , there is some solace to be sought in the fact other countries , such as canada and australia have struggled with the same problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's 16 state premiers meet in berlin and although there are not many examples of reforms which worked , there are no shortage of objectives .
federalism expert , fischer says that besides centralisation à la french model , canada 's " asymmetric federalism " could also serve as an example for germany . but given that many of the poorer states are not able to fulfil their duties , and considering the outrage that a redistribution of responsibilities from the " poor " to the " rich " states would unleash , such a reform suggestion will likely remain on paper . angela göpfert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german federal reform fails a plan to reform germany 's federal system has failed because of a dispute over control of education policy , several state premiers said on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2005 german politicians ' promises prove hollow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough task ahead economic issues have taken center stage in german coalition talks as negotiators focus on ways to consolidate the national budget .
but new figures predict a bleak economic future and unfulfilled campaign promises . the german budget is deeper in the red than ever before .
economists believe that the government in berlin will have to borrow an extra 35 billion euros minimum this year to meet its expenditures .
and the eu ’ s finance watchdogs in brussels are threatening to impose a massive fine if germany makes no progress in driving its deficit below the 3 percent threshold allowed under the eu stability pact .
the daunting numbers loom over the social democrats and conservative christian union parties as they enter negotiations to form a grand coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel . the designated minister of finance , social democrat peer steinbrück , already said that huge spending cuts , particularly in state subsidies and welfare programs , would be unavoidable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tax cuts this time , she says " i believe we will be forced to abide by the eu ’ s three percent deficit limit by 2007 at the latest , " he said .
" and i ’ m convinced that we can only achieve that through a massive effort to save well over 10 billion euros . "
the cdu / csu says the number should be closer to 25 billion euros .
an agreement must be hammered out primarily on cutting expenditure in the social security systems , which have come under strain due to high unemployment and an aging population .
also chancellor schröder ’ s labor market reform has turned out to be much more expensive than expected .
a crunch issue in the coalition talks is also the wholesale reduction of state subsidies .
promises broken one of the main election campaign promises of the cdu had been a reduction in corporate tax .
now angela merkel admits that this won ’ t happen .
" there ‘ s no room for a net reduction in corporate tax because we will overshoot the deficit limit again this year as the budget shortfall is reaching 4 percent , " she said .

20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "

student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .

he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .

following the detection of bird flu in europe , eu health ministers are meeting to discuss a plan of action .
and as germany tells farmers to halt free-range poultry rearing , christiane hoffmann asks if the threat is real . exactly where is the line between protection and alarmism ?
truth is , just now , no-one seems either willing or able to say , but it seems there is no urgent need to rush out and buy the anti-viral tamiflu , nor indeed to stop eating chicken . there are two fundamental issues , and they have to be separated .
on the one hand there is the threat to animals and on the other , the danger posed to humans .
first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

first and foremost , bird flu is an animal epidemic , which has remained in the animal kingdom , where it has caused serious havoc . ten million birds have been culled in asia over the past two years in a bid to stem the spread of the virus , but with migratory birds threatening to carry the flu all over the world , the measures have been of little use . it is crucial to look at the conditions in which animals are kept .
germany 's new regulation that poultry be confined to pens is both necessary and correct , but there is nonetheless the danger , that the situation could have a negative economic effect on organic farmers .
but to draw such a conclusion would be wrong . old virus re-visits there is nothing new about this poultry pest , in fact it has been recurring repeatedly over the past hundred years or so .
two years ago , for example , there was an outbreak of the virus in the netherlands , but it was quickly contained . even the most rigorous precautions are unlikely to prevent the virus from reaching central europe , but given the highly structured nature of precautionary measures in place in europe , the chances of getting it under control once it arrives , are very good . by contrast , countries in the middle east and northern and eastern africa are more likely to struggle to contain any outbreaks of the virus .
the economic impact could be massive , which means such regions need support . no human-to-human transmission thus far , humans have not proved very fertile breeding ground for the virus , as it is can not be transmitted among people . although it can be fatal for human beings , it can only be contracted through extremely close contact with poultry - with blood or excrement - for example through slaughter . there is , however , a hovering fear that if the virus were to mutate and become contagious among humans , it could trigger a pandemic .
the talk is of millions of deaths worldwide , and the more often that figure is repeated , the more threatening it becomes . scientists are particularly nervous because statistically speaking , a major outbreak of flu is long overdue .
there are fears that the h5n1 virus could develop into such a super-virus , but there is no certainty about that . it could , of course , be a completely different virus which sparks an epidemic , and that could happen next year , in twenty years time , or not at all . in real terms , it 's a good idea to take precautions such as stockpiling medication but there is no need for concern or panic reactions , and to play on the fears of people through repeated references to a possible pandemic is quite simply irresponsible . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

a new study says most germans are in favor of legally assisted suicide .
but in its own report , a group caring for the terminally ill says germans would see voluntary suicide differently if they had a real choice . last month , the swiss organisation for assisted suicide , dignitas , founded a branch in germany , fueling an already controversial debate over whether or not germans should be allowed to choose when to die . now , a study commissioned by germany 's stern news magazine following the dignitas debut , reveals that 74 percent of germans believe doctors caring for terminally ill patients should be allowed to put an end to their suffering by being given the authority to administer lethal injections . a mere 20 percent of those questioned voiced opposition to the practice , while six percent were undecided .
the study , which reflects a growing fear among the german population about dying in anguish , comes amidst reports of poor conditions in nursing homes across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on in a hospice ?
but the german hospice foundation has responded to the results of the survey with skepticism , saying that people do n't know enough about the alternatives available to them . a counter survey conducted by the emnid research group and commissioned by the foundation which cares for terminally ill patients in homes all over germany , revealed that only three out of 100 germans know what " palliative care " is , and only one in five are familiar with hospice practices . the president of the organization , eugen brysch said a greater knowledge was enough to change people 's perceptions . " in our study we confronted people with existing alternatives of dying in caring circumstances .
we explained to them the possibilities of pain-killing medicine and individual care in the process of dying .
a majority of people then expressed the will to live a self-determined life until the end and opted against assisted suicide , “ brysch said . better informed presenting interviewees , as it did , with greater information about the benefits of all-round care , the emnid survey produced very different results .
some 56 percent of germans said they would prefer to be cared for in a hospice than resort to assisted suicide . bildunterschrift : care is not all about medication but therein lies a problem .
as brysch was forced to acknowledge , germany is something of a developing nation when it comes to palliative care provisions .
he conceded that presently a mere two percent of some 800,000 people who die in germany every year , have access to individual care while dying . his mission is to change that .
he is vehemently opposed to the presence of dignitas in germany , and has urged politicians not to relax the legislation under which euthanasia is currently outlawed . " the real scandal is that politicians who fail to do anything about the terrible conditions in our nursing homes are allowing organizations like dignitas to work in this country .
they exploit popular fears of dying in inhumane circumstances in an effort to soften stringent laws here , “ brysch said . boosting palliative care with such contradictory results from the two studies , which were conducted within a matter of weeks of each other , it is hard to clearly establish what germans really want . but the effect of the publications has been to heat the debate to such an extent , that the government has pledged a 250 million euro -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- cash injection into care for the terminally ill .
the money is intended to facilitate the creation of some 330 palliative teams to care for patients at home , in nursing homes and hospices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister , ulla schmidt health minister , ulla schmidt , said that one in 10 terminally ill people needed such care in order to achieve the ultimate aim of treating those in need so well that they never come up against a wish to die . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suicide letters a german bestseller suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.10.2005 " the lowest of the low " no more großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book exposed the grim underbelly of guest workers ' lives in 1985 , a book written by an investigative journalist forced germany to face up to its immigrant minority .
20 years later , author günther wallraff feels his country still has n't learned its lessons . by the early 1980s , günther wallraff had already earned a sterling reputation as one of the country 's top investigative journalists .
he tirelessly uncovered postwar germany 's darkest secrets , lifting the lid on the country 's psychiatric hospitals , factories , tabloid newspapers and intelligence serves .
but wallraff 's most profound impact on german society was made when he adopted the identity of turkish guest worker ali levent .
wallraff spent two years undercover , experiencing first-hand the difficulty of life in germany 's immigrant netherworlds . twenty years ago this week , he published " ganz unten " or " the lowest of the low " , a book that would become the definitive work on germany 's immigrant workforce and resonate with readers around the world .
three million copies of the book were sold over the ensuing three years , prompting the nation to put a more human face on its turkish community , and also confront the unacceptable conditions this workforce had been subjected to since its arrival in the 1950s .
a " shock to the system " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff : shining a light into the darkest recesses of german society " i think the book was a shock to everyone 's system , " wallraff said .
" it was read by everyone , including sections of the public who would never normally go to bookstores .
back then , it was the best-selling book in germany 's post-war history , and it really spoke to everyone 's conscience . "
germans began to take notice of their turkish neighbors and the words and tone used to depict the plight of the immigrant workforce changed dramatically .
" people started talking about the modern slave trade , and became more sympathetic to the victims , " said wallraff .
" there was a gradual clamp-down on the big earners , the human traffickers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking notice " i received thousand of letters from turkish immigrants who said that their german neighbors and colleagues had started chatting to them for the first time , " he said .
" i believe the book relieved their sense of alienation here . "
a standard work for a generation of turks " the lowest of the low " was translated in 30 languages , becoming standard reading in many countries , including turkey .
" günther wallraff 's book was a thunderbolt , " said turkish journalist asim gürsoy .
" " it really highlighted the plight of turkish immigrants .
until then , germans had no idea what immigrants were up against .
the book still has n't been forgotten . it 's a seminal work on immigrant issues that should be compulsory reading for young turks and germans . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book that started a debate for many young turkish people living in germany , it already is .
student öznur özcan says reading the book is instrumental in understanding how far germany and its immigrants have come - and how far they still must go .
" if you think about whether the same problems still exist today … then you realize that some things have n't changed , " he said .
" but the problems are n't as acute as they were twenty years ago . "
germany 's continuing integration problem wallraff might disagree .
the dismantling of germany 's once-generous welfare state through the pressures of globalization threatens to force a whole new generation to join the " lowest of the low " , he said .
turkish guest workers have now been replaced by romanians , poles , russians , and the long-term unemployed from the former east germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overcoming prejudices " back then , the turkish workers were getting paid 6 deutschmarks -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- an hour , " he said .
" today , people are working for 2 euros -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- . "
he believes germany still has a long way to go before it 's dealt with questions of immigrant integration .
" germany still has to rid itself of its prejudices , " he said .
" i feel the majority of german society is still unaware that immigration brings with it a number of advantages , that in fact it helps society survive .
even the conservatives have to acknowledge that society is condemned to die out because it 's hostile to children and outsiders .
it thinks it 's better than everyone else , and for as long as that 's the case , it will stagnate , it will remain in a steady decline .

that includes being able to write in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applicants should be able to deal with basic paperwork but judges of the federal administrative court decided to set the bar relatively low , ruling that a basic command of the german language needed to deal with authorities , read simple texts and maintain a general conversation was sufficient to fulfil the language requirements laid out in germany 's immigration legislation - and deeming it unlawful for state authorities to require applicants for german citizenship to pass writing tests . the tricky process of integration but that was exactly what was required of nihat m. , who runs a small restaurant in stuttgart . when he proved unable to write a postcard without any grammatical mistakes - a test authorities can now request in the absence of any language proficiency certificates - he was denied a german passport . " he passed most of the german test , " said his lawyer ursula röder thursday .
" but he fell down on written skills .
he 's been doing fine in germany for decades , and managing to run his own business , but obviously writing a postcard without making any mistakes is very difficult for him . " baden-württemberg 's administrative court had turned down his application for citizenship on the grounds that the new immigration law was designed to promote better integration of foreigners in germany , a process dependent on an adequate knowledge of german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being eligible to vote is a major step to feeling integrated but röder argued that for nihat m. , integration was impossible without a german passport .
" he wants to be able to vote here after decades living here , he wants to take an active part in public life , " she said .
" and he 's right .
that 's what integration policies are all about , that was the whole point of the new laws . " 100 percent skills not necessary the judges agreed , and decided in her client 's favour .
perfect written skills in the language are not necessary , it said , so long as applicants can speak and understand german adequately . " candidates must be able to give active response to written texts - either alone or with the help of another person - and that response has to be in writing , " said court spokesman wolfgang sailer . " but he may seek help from another person when writing in german .
so candidates do n't have to have one hundred percent perfect skills when writing without help . " " i 'm very pleased for my client , but i 'm also pleased that there is now some clarity in the rules , " said ursula röder . " as the authorities themselves say , there are a large number of cases like this , and they were simply waiting for a ruling before processing these applications .
i believe it is very , very important that we now have a national guideline . " a palestinian applicant who 's lived in germany for twenty years was less lucky .
illiterate even in his own language , the court decided he should be refused citizenship on the grounds that he is unable to read german . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

events this weekend include fireworks over the river medway on friday and beacon lighting across the region .
on sunday , walkers in east sussex will be visiting the site in uckfield where it is said the first cannon was cast .
kent 's maritime history - with its strong connections with the royal navy and the former royal dockyards - has made trafalgar day particularly relevant to the county .
the first permanent royal dockyard was established at portsmouth at the end of the 15th century , followed by additional dockyards along the thames and medway to ensure the navy were positioned close to london .
south east beacon sites kent beacon sites include broadstairs , challock , cuxton , dymchurch , folkestone , hythe , kemsing , lydd , new romney , ramsgate , sandwich , smardon , tenterden and whitstable east sussex beacons are being lit in ashburnham , bexhill , brede , brightling , crowborough , east chiltington , east hoathly , heathfield , rye and winchelsea west sussex will have a town council beacon at bognor regis , and charity-run beacon events at arundel , haywards heath , shoreham and on the beach at west wittering surrey beacons being lit by councils and charities can be found at chertsey , farnham , godalming , guildford , headley , horley , lingfield , shackleford and woldingham the additional royal dockyards were at woolwich , deptford , sheerness and chatham , which was used to repair warships moored on the medway during the winter .
nelson arrived in medway in 1771 as a 12-year-old midshipman .
his flagship in the battle of trafalgar had already been built at no 2 dock in the chatham shipbuilding yard .
the dock was renamed victory dock this year .
events in kent include an exhibition of embroidery by horatia , nelson 's only daughter , in tenterden where she lived for almost 30 years .
and nelsons of the future will also be celebrating in westerham when the first sea cadet unit is opening in the south of england for more than 20 years - 30 youngsters from the sevenoaks area have already signed up .
events listed in the sussex area include a celebratory dinner organised by the hastings and battle astronomical society , where one of the members is said to be a descendant of lord nelson .
hms victory will be at the centre of the trafalgar celebrations the member will be piped into the society 's viewing dome carrying the vice admiral 's reading glasses , the trafalgar weekend website says .
in surrey , the dorking friends of cancer research uk will be celebrating at the tithe barn in the town 's burford bridge hotel , which is said to be the place where lady emma hamilton would meet lord nelson .
fireworks , bell ringing and the lighting of beacons will take place in towns across the south east region .
bell ringing at wouldham in kent will mark the place where walter burke , the purser on hms victory , lived .
walter burke held nelson as he died on board victory , and is himself buried near the church .

analysis by tim weber business editor , bbc news website google 's founders have global ambitions as internet search engine google reports record quarterly profits , bbc news investigates what the secretive internet giant 's strategy could be .
google is wealthy .
very wealthy .
after two share offerings the firm has $ 7.6bn -lrb- £ 4.2bn -rrb- cash in the bank , and a stock market value of more than $ 54bn .
during the first nine months of the year , google earned a cool $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 845m -rrb- before taxes .
not bad for a company that celebrated its seventh birthday just a few days ago .
google 's technology may be based on rocket science algorithms , but the secret of its success is simple : provide the best search engine in the digital world , and surround the results with cleverly selected ads that meet the needs of the user .
the google cash register not long ago , online advertising was considered a turn-off and in decline .
google in numbers hq : mountain view , california staff : 4,989 -lrb- sept ' 05 -rrb- pre-tax profit : $ 1.5bn -lrb- jan-sept ' 05 -rrb- cash in bank : $ 7.6bn top search engine in europe 80 % of all european search page views 41 % of all us search page views europe : 120m users each month uk : 16.6m unique users google 's adverts , however , manage to strike the right balance between useful and unobtrusive .
search on google for " france holiday hotels " and your results page will be surrounded by " sponsored links " , little adverts that just happen to be exactly what you are looking for .
click on one of them and the google cash register rings , to the tune of about 50 us cents a click say analysts , although some keywords are much more expensive .
most of the money is generated by google 's own website , but plenty comes through partners like aol which - for a share of the revenue - display google 's sponsored links on their websites .
" ads actually do have value if you can figure out the right ones to show , " says google 's chief executive eric schmidt .
google everywhere , part 1 but apart from advertising , what is google really up to ?
the company is notorious for keeping its cards close to its chest .
observers are left to judge google 's strategy by analysing the dizzying array of services and tools launched over the past few years .
amongst the offerings : a browser toolbar , an integrated desktop search , webmail service gmail , image editor picasa , internet telephony google talk , an online rss reader , blogger , news , price comparison service froogle , maps , satellite images , automated alerts , online translation , and specialised search services for images , video , local information and more .
an online payment system is in the works , and a recently announced alliance with sun microsystems could get google into the market for free office software .
it does not take a degree in conspiracy theory to wonder whether all this shapes up to a new all-encompassing , self-contained computer architecture .
google everywhere , part 2 google 's international ambitions certainly do n't lack in scale .
so far its services can be obtained in 109 languages , and most countries in the world have the benefit of a dedicated google home page .
google is preparing to extend its headquarters " three-and-a-half years ago we did n't exist in europe , we had one guy in california who was looking after europe , " says nikesh arora , google board member and the man in charge of the firm 's european operations .
still , google is " not happy with the speed of rolling out the internationalisation of our products " , he says .
so does google want to be the next microsoft ?
the conspiracy theories do n't wash with mr arora .
google , he says , simply stays true to the mission statement postulated by founders larry page and sergey brin : " organising the world 's information and making it universally accessible and useful . "
oh - and " do n't do evil " .
evolving - or just clueless ?
so how long will it take to get the world sorted ?
we are just seven years old , but we have to grow up very quickly nikesh arora , google 's man in charge of the firm 's european operations google 's share price live " three hundred years " , says google boss eric schmidt , citing a little internal math exercise conducted by the firm 's whiz kids .
but where is the focus ?
why does google roll out so many diverse tools where one user interface hardly resembles the other ?
mr arora admits that " not everything is tied down together yet , " but insists that " slowly and steadily we bring things together " .
all of google 's tools and services , says mr arora , have just two purposes : they help users to find and organise whatever information is out there , and allow them to share the information with others .
google 's internal culture may explain the haphazard approach of getting there .
whoever comes up with a " smart idea " writes it up , says mr arora , and if it strikes a chord , google 's engineers sign up and commit a certain amount of their time .
" there is no grand unification theory , but it 's a democratic evolution of our offering , " says mr arora .
" and once we got a great product , we will find a business model to go with it . "
in most cases , this model revolves around selling adverts .
this is not just about creating sales leads , says mr arora .
" if your company does n't show up in a search for a product you offer , you have missed an opportunity to build your brand . "
making enemies as google extends its reach across the world , it can not avoid treading on a few toes .
google is a threat to microsoft just as microsoft was a threat to ibm jim steele , president of salesforce.com publishers and authors have sued google to stop its ambitious project of scanning and indexing millions of books .
they worry about the potential for copyright infringement .
in the uk and germany , google had to drop its gmail brand in the face of rival claims to the trademark .
in china , google first got into trouble with the country 's critics over allegations that it co-operated with china 's censorship of the internet , and then with the beijing government itself over how to describe taiwan on its online maps .
privacy advocates fret over the mountains of " transactional and personal data " piling up in google 's vast databases .
and whenever google tweaks its search algorithm , the engineers in mountain view , california , have to brace themselves for howls of outrage from thousands of small online retailers who drop off the first page of search results .
fighting yahoo and microsoft and then there are the two other gorillas of the online world , yahoo and microsoft .
the rivalry with yahoo is obvious ; both firms are in the paid-links search business .
yahoo has bought a string of competitors to forge a service to rival google 's .
its most important acquisition was overture , the company that invented the concept of search-driven online ads .
coupled with a fresh emphasis on exclusive content , yahoo hopes to draw punters away from google .
microsoft , meanwhile , is wary of what google might do beyond the search business .
" google is a threat to microsoft just as microsoft was a threat to ibm , " says jim steele , president of salesforce.com , an on-demand software company .
some of google 's projects have indeed the potential to undermine several of microsoft 's key revenue streams .
microsoft 's bosses are clearly worried .
chief executive steve ballmer was recently quoted as saying that he would love to " kill google " , while company founder bill gates keeps repeating the mantra of putting google out of business by developing a better search engine .
google 's response is a hefty investment in its search business .
the firm just announced plans for a massive extension of its " googleplex " headquarter .
" we understand the challenge and do our best to compete , " says mr arora .
" we dedicate 70 % of our -lsb- research and development budget -rsb- on search , about 2,000 engineers are working on nothing else , " he says .
one click away but google has a simple problem .
if its engineers fall behind , its rivals are just one click away .
" if consumers see a perceptible quality difference -lsb- with rival search engines -rsb- , they will disappear , " admits mr arora .
and suddenly all of google 's little tools make perfect sense .
microsoft relies on computer users being too sedate to download rival web browsers .
google , for its part , hopes that its useful desktop tools will be sticky enough to keep people within the virtual googleplex .
but with both yahoo and microsoft giving chase , google must hurry to merge its disparate tools .
" we are just seven years old , but we have to grow up very quickly , " says mr arora .

amongst the offerings : a browser toolbar , an integrated desktop search , webmail service gmail , image editor picasa , internet telephony google talk , an online rss reader , blogger , news , price comparison service froogle , maps , satellite images , automated alerts , online translation , and specialised search services for images , video , local information and more .
an online payment system is in the works , and a recently announced alliance with sun microsystems could get google into the market for free office software .
it does not take a degree in conspiracy theory to wonder whether all this shapes up to a new all-encompassing , self-contained computer architecture .
google everywhere , part 2 google 's international ambitions certainly do n't lack in scale .
so far its services can be obtained in 109 languages , and most countries in the world have the benefit of a dedicated google home page .
google is preparing to extend its headquarters " three-and-a-half years ago we did n't exist in europe , we had one guy in california who was looking after europe , " says nikesh arora , google board member and the man in charge of the firm 's european operations .
still , google is " not happy with the speed of rolling out the internationalisation of our products " , he says .
so does google want to be the next microsoft ?
the conspiracy theories do n't wash with mr arora .
google , he says , simply stays true to the mission statement postulated by founders larry page and sergey brin : " organising the world 's information and making it universally accessible and useful . "
oh - and " do n't do evil " .
evolving - or just clueless ?
so how long will it take to get the world sorted ?
we are just seven years old , but we have to grow up very quickly nikesh arora , google 's man in charge of the firm 's european operations google 's share price live " three hundred years " , says google boss eric schmidt , citing a little internal math exercise conducted by the firm 's whiz kids .
but where is the focus ?
why does google roll out so many diverse tools where one user interface hardly resembles the other ?
mr arora admits that " not everything is tied down together yet , " but insists that " slowly and steadily we bring things together " .
all of google 's tools and services , says mr arora , have just two purposes : they help users to find and organise whatever information is out there , and allow them to share the information with others .
google 's internal culture may explain the haphazard approach of getting there .
whoever comes up with a " smart idea " writes it up , says mr arora , and if it strikes a chord , google 's engineers sign up and commit a certain amount of their time .
" there is no grand unification theory , but it 's a democratic evolution of our offering , " says mr arora .
" and once we got a great product , we will find a business model to go with it . "
in most cases , this model revolves around selling adverts .
this is not just about creating sales leads , says mr arora .
" if your company does n't show up in a search for a product you offer , you have missed an opportunity to build your brand . "
making enemies as google extends its reach across the world , it can not avoid treading on a few toes .
google is a threat to microsoft just as microsoft was a threat to ibm jim steele , president of salesforce.com publishers and authors have sued google to stop its ambitious project of scanning and indexing millions of books .
they worry about the potential for copyright infringement .
in the uk and germany , google had to drop its gmail brand in the face of rival claims to the trademark .
in china , google first got into trouble with the country 's critics over allegations that it co-operated with china 's censorship of the internet , and then with the beijing government itself over how to describe taiwan on its online maps .
privacy advocates fret over the mountains of " transactional and personal data " piling up in google 's vast databases .
and whenever google tweaks its search algorithm , the engineers in mountain view , california , have to brace themselves for howls of outrage from thousands of small online retailers who drop off the first page of search results .
fighting yahoo and microsoft and then there are the two other gorillas of the online world , yahoo and microsoft .
the rivalry with yahoo is obvious ; both firms are in the paid-links search business .
yahoo has bought a string of competitors to forge a service to rival google 's .
its most important acquisition was overture , the company that invented the concept of search-driven online ads .
coupled with a fresh emphasis on exclusive content , yahoo hopes to draw punters away from google .
microsoft , meanwhile , is wary of what google might do beyond the search business .
" google is a threat to microsoft just as microsoft was a threat to ibm , " says jim steele , president of salesforce.com , an on-demand software company .
some of google 's projects have indeed the potential to undermine several of microsoft 's key revenue streams .
microsoft 's bosses are clearly worried .
chief executive steve ballmer was recently quoted as saying that he would love to " kill google " , while company founder bill gates keeps repeating the mantra of putting google out of business by developing a better search engine .
google 's response is a hefty investment in its search business .
the firm just announced plans for a massive extension of its " googleplex " headquarter .
" we understand the challenge and do our best to compete , " says mr arora .
" we dedicate 70 % of our -lsb- research and development budget -rsb- on search , about 2,000 engineers are working on nothing else , " he says .
one click away but google has a simple problem .
if its engineers fall behind , its rivals are just one click away .
" if consumers see a perceptible quality difference -lsb- with rival search engines -rsb- , they will disappear , " admits mr arora .
and suddenly all of google 's little tools make perfect sense .
microsoft relies on computer users being too sedate to download rival web browsers .
google , for its part , hopes that its useful desktop tools will be sticky enough to keep people within the virtual googleplex .
but with both yahoo and microsoft giving chase , google must hurry to merge its disparate tools .
" we are just seven years old , but we have to grow up very quickly , " says mr arora .

analysis by tim weber business editor , bbc news website google 's founders have global ambitions as internet search engine google reports record quarterly profits , bbc news investigates what the secretive internet giant 's strategy could be .
google is wealthy .
very wealthy .
after two share offerings the firm has $ 7.6bn -lrb- £ 4.2bn -rrb- cash in the bank , and a stock market value of more than $ 54bn .
during the first nine months of the year , google earned a cool $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 845m -rrb- before taxes .
not bad for a company that celebrated its seventh birthday just a few days ago .
google 's technology may be based on rocket science algorithms , but the secret of its success is simple : provide the best search engine in the digital world , and surround the results with cleverly selected ads that meet the needs of the user .
the google cash register not long ago , online advertising was considered a turn-off and in decline .

search on google for " france holiday hotels " and your results page will be surrounded by " sponsored links " , little adverts that just happen to be exactly what you are looking for .
click on one of them and the google cash register rings , to the tune of about 50 us cents a click say analysts , although some keywords are much more expensive .
most of the money is generated by google 's own website , but plenty comes through partners like aol which - for a share of the revenue - display google 's sponsored links on their websites .
" ads actually do have value if you can figure out the right ones to show , " says google 's chief executive eric schmidt .

more than 1,000 residents in houghton signed a petition opposing plans for a new custody suite after existing ones in carlisle were wrecked by floods .
carlisle city councillors narrowly rejected the application after some residents spoke at a planning meeting .
cumbria police authority says it is now left with no option but to appeal .
cumbria police submitted plans for the custody suite at their traffic base in houghton to replace the rickergate site , damaged in the january floods .
' naturally disappointed ' councillors had been recommended to back the plans , but the proposal was defeated by just one vote .
cumbria police had moved to allay the fears of some residents , who claimed released prisoners could put children and property at risk .
chairman of cumbria police authority , reg watson said : " i 'm afraid the only thing we can do is appeal .
" if we try to place the custody unit anywhere else in carlisle , the same thing is going to happen , because the people will say that if it is bad for houghton , it must be bad for them . "
assistant chief constable neil rhodes added : " we are naturally disappointed that our application has been declined .
" a significant amount of time and effort has gone into the application and we believe that houghton is still the best site and location for the custody facility . "

but 49-year-old brazilian director fernando meirelles , who won miramax backing for the much-lauded brazilian film city of god in 2004 , is still not satisfied .
" i do n't want to see this film again , " he told the bbc news website .
" i 'm happy with the film , but of course i would change hundreds of things . "
" i never stop working on a film .
i ca n't help myself . "
the film , based on a best-selling john le carre novel , is the story of a british diplomat -lrb- fiennes -rrb- whose wife is murdered when she threatens to expose the pharmaceutical companies testing drugs on innocent africans .
i am more interested in doing smaller films that i can control fernando meirelles principally shot in kibera , kenya , the largest slum town in africa , the film began as a political drama but ultimately evolved into a powerful and moving love story .
" when i first read the script , the political side of the story really interested me .
i was interested in talking about pharmaceutical companies , and how corporations and government work together , " meirelles said .
" but then , watching the whole film , it was like hearing my own voice - like the director preaching to the audience .
so i started to cut and in the end , i think it became more of a love story . "
the rare opportunity to shoot a film in kenya was all the more remarkable considering le carre 's novel was originally banned in the east african country because of its depiction of corrupt kenyan officials .
but the persuasive charms of british producer simon channing-williams , whose films include the award-winning vera drake , won through .
the british film was shot on location in kenya and london " they did n't want us to shoot there in the beginning .
but simon is a great diplomat , and he explained to the kenyan government that we were going to do the film anyway . "
" and when they realised that shooting the film in nairobi would bring some visibility to the country , some money and jobs , we had lots of support . "
the welcome the british film crew received in kenya was returned in kind .
producer channing-williams set to work making small changes to improve the lives of local kenyans - installing water tanks , a new bridge and a classroom in kibera , and a secondary school in the deserts of northern kenya where the film concludes .
" i think , in the next two or three years , we are going to see a lot of films set in africa , or about africa , " said meirelles , who claims the poverty of brazil 's shanty towns pale in comparison to the poverty he witnessed in africa .
" we forgot this continent for a long time - and now , finally africa is being rediscovered . "
he cites a number of africa-led dramas in production , including the last king of scotland , from british documentary-maker kevin macdonald , based on the fall of idi amin .
fiennes has praised meirelles ' " energy " as a director " everybody is more interested in political films now .
even the young generation are starting to talk about international politics - everybody is getting more involved . "
for his own part , meirelles is keen to keep his distance from the hollywood studios .
" i am not planning on doing big studio movies , i want to do my own personal projects . "
" if you do a film with a high budget , people want to control it .
marketing people tell you what to do , and where to cut , so they can get their money back .
i am more interested in doing smaller films that i can control . "
the film-maker plans to return to his native brazil to complete work on a film script featuring seven stories from around the world about globalisation .
" it is not a political or sociological film , it is more philosophical - it is about happiness .
what makes us happy and the choices we take in life . "

but 49-year-old brazilian director fernando meirelles , who won miramax backing for the much-lauded brazilian film city of god in 2004 , is still not satisfied .
" i do n't want to see this film again , " he told the bbc news website .
" i 'm happy with the film , but of course i would change hundreds of things . "
" i never stop working on a film .
i ca n't help myself . "
the film , based on a best-selling john le carre novel , is the story of a british diplomat -lrb- fiennes -rrb- whose wife is murdered when she threatens to expose the pharmaceutical companies testing drugs on innocent africans .
i am more interested in doing smaller films that i can control fernando meirelles principally shot in kibera , kenya , the largest slum town in africa , the film began as a political drama but ultimately evolved into a powerful and moving love story .
" when i first read the script , the political side of the story really interested me .
i was interested in talking about pharmaceutical companies , and how corporations and government work together , " meirelles said .
" but then , watching the whole film , it was like hearing my own voice - like the director preaching to the audience .
so i started to cut and in the end , i think it became more of a love story . "
the rare opportunity to shoot a film in kenya was all the more remarkable considering le carre 's novel was originally banned in the east african country because of its depiction of corrupt kenyan officials .
but the persuasive charms of british producer simon channing-williams , whose films include the award-winning vera drake , won through .
the british film was shot on location in kenya and london " they did n't want us to shoot there in the beginning .
but simon is a great diplomat , and he explained to the kenyan government that we were going to do the film anyway . "
" and when they realised that shooting the film in nairobi would bring some visibility to the country , some money and jobs , we had lots of support . "
the welcome the british film crew received in kenya was returned in kind .
producer channing-williams set to work making small changes to improve the lives of local kenyans - installing water tanks , a new bridge and a classroom in kibera , and a secondary school in the deserts of northern kenya where the film concludes .
" i think , in the next two or three years , we are going to see a lot of films set in africa , or about africa , " said meirelles , who claims the poverty of brazil 's shanty towns pale in comparison to the poverty he witnessed in africa .

irish actor ciaran hinds plays julius caesar in the series a co-production between bbc and us cable network hbo , the programme recreates julius caesar 's rise to power and the birth of the roman empire on a scale unthinkable 30 years ago when 70s hit i , claudius was made .
but the show 's explicit sex and violence has already provoked complaints .
tory mp and express columnist anne widdicombe hs already called it a " feast of decadence " and more " akin to a porn movie " .
there has also been concern expressed that the show will start at 9pm , only just after the watershed , with a children 's version already re-cut for italy .
an opening battle scene recalls the ferocity of ridley scott 's gladiator , followed by a sex scene that would not have looked out of place in the notorious 1979 film version of caligula .
kevin mckidd plays a legionary caught up in great events those who do not switch off in disgust will be treated to a flogging , a crucifixion , numerous deaths and an impalement .
before the first episode is over , they will see actress polly walker drenched in blood after a simulated animal sacrifice .
jane tranter , the bbc 's controller of drama commissioning , insisted such graphic scenes were not arbitrary .
" every time there is a moment of sex and violence , it is there to tell a story , " she said .
" it 's never gratuitous or stuck on , but absolutely embedded in character and plot . "
lindsay duncan , who plays caesar 's erstwhile lover servilia , said : " the romans had a completely different set of moral values .
" our aim was to view their world through a modern lens , but without our moral considerations . "
" we 're showing rome the way it was , " added james purefoy , who plays an ambitious and sexually promiscuous mark antony .
" this was a pre-christian , pagan society . "
' thrilling ' the british actor 's attitudes do not extend to letting his eight-year-old son stay up after the watershed to see his father in action .
" it 's too violent , the sex scenes are too graphic , and it 's on after 2100 , " he told the bbc news website .
" i 'd let him watch it when he 's 12 or 13 , when he 's a bit more comfortable about sexuality and stuff . "
co-creator and executive producer bruno heller added : " i hope it -lsb- the show -rsb- is shocking .
you ca n't understand that period of history unless it shocks you somewhat . "
the writer believes rome 's pagan world of life-and-death combat , ritualised sacrifice and orgiastic copulation is not as far removed from our own society as some would like to believe .
" we do n't have gladiatorial arenas , but sex and violence is as much a part of the entertainment world as it was then .
" the romans had a much more direct , unashamed attitude towards these things .
to be true to the period we had to show that . "
viewers will see actress polly walker drenched in bull 's blood shot in rome 's cinecitta studios on the world 's largest standing set , featuring hundreds of actors wearing more than 4,000 pieces of wardrobe , the scale of the series is more akin to a feature film than a tv series .
" it was thrilling , absolutely thrilling the first time you walked onto that set , " says actor ciaran hinds , whose role as caesar extends from his conquering of gaul in the first episode to his assassination in the 11th .
" it was never less than a challenge , but it was a huge , exciting project .
a part of me will miss not being in the next series . "
and a second series there will definitely be , and potentially another after that .
james purefoy has committed himself for the next six years .
" it 's a 10,000-piece jigsaw , and every piece matters , " he says .

who do you think will be best to lead the conservative party ?
the two remaining contenders for the tory leadership will now compete in a nationwide poll of 300,000 conservative party members .
david cameron and david davis go into the ballot following the elimination of dr liam fox on thursday , and ken clarke on tuesday .
over the next six weeks the leadership hopefuls will try to win over the party grassroots , with the final vote result due on 6 december .
who has impressed you the most ?
have personal interest stories helped the candidates and their party ?
who should lead the tories ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .

"
a positive , inclusive , socially concerned and pro-people tory party led by a personable , decent and bright young man ?
can this be possible ?
labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales " it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century " lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs " cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy " neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford " never send a man to do a woman 's job ! "
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex " david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible " gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford " david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader " tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire " cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible ! "
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford " what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ? "
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london " we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics " pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland " the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader " mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york " cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition " sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil " liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair " sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset " i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq " julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

can this be possible ?
labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .

anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .

davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .

i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .

labour voters must be cursing cameron in their sleep .
david , leicester , uk a loss to the leadership race-liam fox , with his experience as a doctor and his time in parliament could have applied the tax cuts in a socially compassionate way , reaching out to those voters who are supporting the psuedo-conservatives under tony blair .
ali johnston , romsey why not put both candidates up for pmqs and see their commons performance against tony blair ?
simon price , newport , s. wales i am amazed that so many people are interested in this farce .
it will make absolutely no difference who wins as the tory party no longer knows what it stands for .
i would dearly love an effective alternative to blair but sadly it 's not going to come from the tory party .
peter clarke , cardiff , wales it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century lee , plymouth , uk as a young tory voter i feel that david cameron is the only person that can possibly take the party forward .
it 's about time the tories stopped living in the past and are brought into the 21st century .
lee , plymouth , uk it appears that at last tory has found a charismatic leader of the calibre of tony blair of labour party in 1997 .
vijay k vijayaratnam , croydon , uk cameron and fox were the breaths of fresh air and the ways forward .
i know not one party member who likes davis .
conservative councillor , uk whilst i 'm very glad cameron has made such a lot of headway , it seems somewhat churlish for all the media to remark on ' how far ahead he is ' .
surely , 90 % of fox 's backers would have gone to davis , leaving a very different picture for the conservative members , with davis perhaps even edging the parliamentary vote between him and cameron .
jfh , london none of the candidates going forward have a hope of leading the conservatives into government at the next election .
this looks to be a caretaker post until the conservative party dissolves .
both labour and liberal democrat members must be delighted with the outcome .
rb , newcastle , tyne and wear so david cameron represents a ' generation change ' for the tory 's does he ?
well , in 1997 we heard the same of mr hague .
in fact hague was younger then than cameron is now .
cameron is merely hague with hair .
cameron 's shine will fade fast when he 's exposed at the despatch box .
he 's no more than a pretty face .
andrew , wells , uk cameron 's proposed chancellor is george osborne , a man with utterly deranged tax plans -lrb- even the right-wing ' spectator ' magazine says they 're barking mad -rrb- .
the one thing we 've yet to hear is cameron 's policies , and for good reason - they 're lunatic .
anybody but cameron i 'd say !
john , london uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the foreseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england what a breath of fresh air - he 's got my vote already .
i 've always voted labour , but if david cameron wins the ballot for leader , i would definitely change my allegiance - would even join the conservative party and take an active interest in politics .
keep up the good work david c !
joy brewster , uppingham , oakham , uk cameron is just another blair , he never answers the question .
it 's time for a change , it 's time for honesty and someone who wants the best for the country , not just their career .
davis all the way !
rebecca , potters bar i am appalled .
liam fox was the only principled candidate with a modern alternative and now he is out .
labour are rubbing their hands at the prospect of uncharismatic davis or cameron , who makes peter mandleson look principled .
british conservatism died today .
tim aker , nottingham more of the same with " no charisma " davis .
more of " blair " with cameron .
i 'm interested to see what they have to offer business , the powerhouse of the economy , which for both appears not to be pc subject .
eugenio leijten , somerton , somerset the actual answer is boris johnson , if the tories ever want to regain government !
joost hartog , penrhyn bay , uk it is obvious that cameron will win as the tories are only trying to copy the labour winning formula by getting a younger man to do the job .
i do not think it will make any difference .
i can not see a tory government in the forseeable future .
roger , huntingdon , cambs cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy neil , london cameron seems capable of winning hearts and minds , but very vague on policy .
however , the tories have actually developed a hatful of excellent policies already ; their failure has been in persuading people to like them .
so i think cameron is probably the right choice .
i agree with liam fox on almost 100 % of what he says , but i am not sure his -lrb- and my -rrb- opinions are electable at the moment , so i suppose it is well that he has been eliminated .
neil , london despite his average speech at conference , david davis is the only man who can lead the party to victory at the next election .
i fear that with cameron it will just be more of the same of what the present government are offering with a few modifications here and there .
davis has a vision that many of the british public can relate to and his straight talking , no nonsense style can win them over .
anton muszanskyj , york , england results of second ballot : cameron : 90 ; not-cameron : 108 steve , london it has got to be cameron , although i must say davis was my first choice .
purely because cameron is so confident and impressive on camera .
it could be the winning formula for the tories .
susan coppin , dudley , england as an ex-tory voter looking for some signs of recovery to the party , neither candidate appeals .
davis appears out of touch , cameron might find that his refusal to answer questions on drugs use will catch-up with him eventually ...
mike smith , newmarket the time has come for new life to be given to the conservative party , and i strongly believe that david cameron is the right man to do this .
jason smith , worthing , west sussex i 'm the same age as cameron , but consider that i have a more rounded view of the uk today .
cameron is a career politician , this is n't good , his election will consign the tories to a further ten years in the wilderness .
alan vear , kent does anyone really know anything about david cameron 's policies - we know he is young and inexperienced but what does he actually believe in ?
bryan tomalin , guildford never send a man to do a woman 's job !
abigail irving , london , uk never send a man to do a woman 's job !
none of these dull men can win back the middle ground of the uk .
the tories really need another thatcher but continue to block the path for talented women .
they deserve the leader they chose .
abigail irving , london , uk so it 's cameron and davis .
while cameron describes himself as a moderniser , but what exactly does that mean and what does he precisely stand for ?
i wonder whether the country really wants what so often is described as modern in 21st century britain .
certain values and principles remain the same whatever the century .
dave , reading liam fox has just been voted out .
i feel that was the right choice .
i feel david cameron will be and should be the next tory leader if they want a chance of regaining power from the other tory party in power , oops , sorry , meant new labour !
on a minor issue how can david davis say he is eurosceptic when it was he who pushed the maastricht treaty through parliament ?
david cameron may be young but i feel that he draws people to him and people are willing to listen to what he has to say and this can only be a good thing .
ryan newell , southampton i do hope cameron wins the final vote .
he is by far the best choice .
marie mansfield , oxford , uk sad dr liam fox did not make it to final round .
david cameron has a big baggage - drug usage and that will always haunt him and the conservative party .
in the interest of long term leadership the party members should opt for david davies .
v s mani , chalfont st peter , uk i am disgusted that dr liam fox has been ousted , he was the only decent one .
aaron wood , edgware , middlesex david cameron ... shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible gene , manchester if the tory party wants to win an election , it should stop promoting only the people its cabinet wishes to support and instead look for what the people want .
david cameron is clearly a step away from " traditional " tory and that is - in many ways - good .
it shows that the conservatives are not completely inflexible .
gene , manchester david cameron .
he looks and sounds like a man who can lead not only the conservative party but the country .
i predict that he will become prime minister at the next election !
suzanne rabey , tisbury , uk i have been most impressed by david cameron , he a fresh face with new ideas .
why do they even need to vote as a party , can they not see he is the only choice .
as a 30-year-old male , white , non voter , nobody has been really interested in my vote .
the way david talks about himself and political issues has got my interest , with many others i am sure .
i am confident he could win an election and lead a new generation of voters .
jeremy , oxford david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire david cameron is our local mp and would make an excellent tory leader .
he is compassionate and cares about local issues .
he may have had a joint or two at university and known a heroin addict but in my opinion that only makes him a better candidate as he does n't shy away from the real problems .
tessa anderson , witney , oxfordshire if david davis gets it , i 'm not voting tory .
clarke was the man for the job - and to all those who rubbish the idea that he could appeal to young as well as old - i 'm 18 .
i anon for the tories ' sake , i hope they vote for cameron because he suits the current image of a modern prime minister , just as blair did when he came to power .
davis is too much like hague and fox is like major .
to win the next election they have to realise that image is everything in this vacuous age .
narah , london , uk if the contest goes to the party membership i would vote for cameron because he stands for values which are attractive to modern britain .
ethnic minorities such as myself have felt excluded from the tories thus far but cameron makes me feel that british-indians can contribute to modern britain and can do so without new labour .
girish , london if a scot who went to fettes and oxford is fit to lead the labour party , why is n't an englishman who went to eton and oxford fir to lead the conservative party ?
tom , london i can not believe how many people on here think that a 38-year-old etonian is going to connect with the man in the street .
have n't the tory party learnt yet that it 's not tory voters that you have to convince , its the people that previously voted labour and lib dem you have to win over !
clarke or davis are the only ones capable of that .
peter howe , milton keynes , england 2009 .
the general election , four years of tax rises due to over optimistic economic growth , an ageing socialist leader whose core beliefs are stuck in the 1970 's verses a young energetic centre right tory leader .
the labour ranks must be very worried about the prospect of facing a cameron-osbourne alliance .
andy , windsor david cameron will be a puppet for the old brigade and if he does n't comply he will go the same way as ids .
blair and brown will fry him at the despatch box azhar , brierfield , lancashire cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield i was initially disappointed at clarke 's elimination as i thought he had the experience to expose the folly of blair and brown , but now it has to be cameron .
he is an inspiration and i hope he wins convincingly in order to unite the party behind him .
my only worry is that this opportunity will come too early for him .
cameron in three or four years ' time will be irresistible !
richard , chesterfield david cameron 's campaign has been nothing less than brilliant putting himself up as a man who can actually win elections rather than just get given the role as leader by default which is probably how david davis looked to be getting the position .
but with liam fox , michael ancram , david davis , theresa may , oliver letwin and malcolm rifkind -lrb- and if they could get ken clarke on board -rrb- the tories would have a better front bench than labour .
-lrb- prescott , reid , lord falconer and charles clarke are a sorry excuse for cabinet ministers -rrb- .
chris marchment , leeds , england why the carping about cameron being an old etonian ?
a privileged education was no bar to blair 's leadership .
under cameron the tories have an opportunity to present a refreshing challenge to this hackneyed labour government ian , stockton much of blair 's success in 1997 was due to his tv image ; he looked young , dynamic and energetic .
cameron resembles tories of old ; elitist , public school-educated and utterly unaware of a world outside his narrow limits .
his public relations team have clearly not considered how much tv images matter in politics these days .
j keane , kilbarchan , scotland we need a younger leader and david cameron fits the bill .
we can not afford to have someone like david davis .
liam fox is a credible person but not strong enough to take on blair , also a bit to right wing for this day and age .
sandra gilfillan , newcastle-upon-tyne use your loaf .
do we still want old etonians to rule us ?
david davis has the education not only of university , but of hardships .
he is also the only current member of the ruling class to have done voluntary military service -lrb- special forces shows backbone -rrb- .
irene , chingford what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france seen from over here , the tories are in the same pit as the french socialists - the incumbent government is unpopular but in the opposing camp they 're too occupied with changing the wallpaper -lrb- i.e. : leadership contests -rrb- than in finding alternatives .
please excuse my french ignorance but what is the new big tory idea which will sweep them in by their millions ?
looks like another ten years labour to me .
dangerous for a government to feel there is no strong opposition .
tony lark , neung sur beuvron , france it 's been said here before , but who ever does win really needs to come up trumps to unite all parts of the party together as one .
this will only happen if the tories really want to win the next election , if not they could be come the third party in british politics !
bert , balham , london if they want a load of toffs to vote for them then any of the three current candidates will do .
if they want the vote of the common man then they should elect boris johnson .
he might have made mistakes , but at least people see him as an equal .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk i would love dr liam fox to be the next conservative leader .
he has radio experience and would have a great media campaign .
robert poulton , bexleyheath , england why should the fact that cameron went to eton be seen as a negative ?
eton is one of the best schools in the world , let alone the country .
a good education should be seen as a pre-requisite for a prospective prime minister not a hindrance .
christian , london we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics pj , newport , uk ken clarke is a throwback to the old conservative party .
to have elected him leader would have been a disaster and set them back five years - sure he may have given blair a few scares , but long term , he is not the right choice .
david cameron is the man to bring them out of the wilderness .
he has youth on his side , possesses all the qualities that a modern political leader should and carries no baggage from the previous conservative government .
the tories need to stop banging on about who can win the next election and realise that they need to engage the voters with something totally fresh .
new labour is beginning to smell a bit stale and we need a shiny new conservative party to reinvigorate our politics not a regurgitation of the old one .
pj , newport , uk i 'm backing cameron in this contest , since i am impressed by his vision , intelligence and charisma .
he is just the tonic the tory party needs to get it back on his feet .
however , i would also like to see fox make the final two , as this would give cameron a real contest for the support of the party membership and a real chance to prove himself , whilst davis would just be a walk-over .
to those who berate the tories for not choosing clarke i say this : if clarke could not even win the support of a fifth of tory mps , how could he ever have been expected to win a general election for the conservative party ?
steve , london , uk i 'm physically allergic to voting tory -lrb- miner 's son -rrb- but for a strong opposition i 'd go for cameron mark lewis , manchester so the eventual new leader will lose the next general election and the process will start all over again in four to five years ' time .
after the mess they left the country in last time lets hope they never are in power again .
neil , runcorn , cheshire i agree - come back boris , all is forgiven !
james vincent , london maggie thatcher - bring her back - she might be 80 but she 's still made of iron .
that party needs smacking with a wet kipper and she 's the one to do it !
oj , hampshire none of the above -lsb- x -rsb- .
maggie thatcher was a woman who would not allow any competition with her leadership .
as a result a whole generation of up-and-coming conservative leadership was eliminated or went elsewhere .
it 'll be a while , i fear , before they have a leader worth voting for .
robin , chatteris it does n't make much difference now .
the best man for the job has already gone .
straight talking is what the conservatives need to win back the public 's confidence , and his rejection resigns the party to have a tidal wave of evasive answers stifle honesty for the foreseeable future .
paul hartley , nottingham , uk i think david cameron is the best choice , he is young , enthusiastic and determined , just the right qualities to lead the conservatives into the next election .
lynda , n. ireland the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader mark , manchester it is impossible for the tories to be reformed by a young man against the older brigade like blair did with labour .
hague and ids found this very quickly , becoming puppets on a string .
the only person that the old school fears is davis .
he is the right age , blend of experience and necessary personality appeal .
davis is the only one that can and will shake the party to its roots .
come on david .
unfortunately it seems that the old school network has cracked the whip once again to get an obedient leader .
the tory machine has worked against him before when he was ousted as party chairman and in previous leadership elections .
mark , manchester david cameron seems to be the tories choice mainly because no-one knows anything about him - i assume everyone hopes he thinks like them !
really not a very good rationale to choose a leader ; why not pick out of a hat ?
james savill , norwich i am impressed by david cameron and liam fox but am afraid my vote would be for david cameron as we have enough scottish politicians running the country already - i do n't relish the thought of another scotsman being pm after gordon brown ...
j covey , manchester the conservatives have lost so much ground in recent years because of a consistent and unshakable desire to move to the " populist " right in an attempt to grab short term and unsustainable bumps in the opinion polls .
david cameron is the only candidate that appears to understand that and therefore the only one who is unlikely to repeat those past mistakes .
equally previous conservative leaders have suffered from a low public profile as it takes time for the public to get to know , and crucially , trust them .
i believe that the tories should think strategically and pick a leader who is young enough to , if necessary , fight not just one but two general elections .
james norman , york cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition sarah sherman , london , uk i never would have contemplated ever voting tory , but i would seriously consider voting for david cameron - especially given the poor labour opposition .
i loathe tony .
sarah sherman , london , uk does davis really think he can win the vote of the common person by continually saying that he was brought up on a council estate ?
this is not what the electorate what to know .
they want to know what he is going to do for families who work their hardest but do n't get far in life .
i should know as i have had this exact upbringing and if davis thinks that he can win the support of first time voters like me in the next general election by repeating he was brought up on a council mistake he is in for a great shock .
vicky hill , lincoln , england cameron picking up 10 from clarke - what are the odds on 66 each ?
glyn , sheffiled david cameron is clearly the only contender who can appeal outside of the conservative core supporters thereby winning the next election and so therefore he is my choice for leader since i want to see the end of the appalling new labour fiasco .
matt davis , london , uk i doubt any of the candidates at present have the ability to remove labour from government .
cameron however would be the one i would choose out of the three remaining candidates , the only problem is if he does get the job and looses the next election .
what then for the conservatives ?
j clarke , bristol , uk liam fox seems to be a good candidate .
his policies are informative and also compassionate and social .
he knows enough about the secret corridors of power in europe , which britain is often ignorant about ; as a doctor , he has a concern for the issues that face society , and the consequences of our so called ' liberal ' society ; and he seems to be concerned more about the politics rather than winning through charisma and character .
james suddrey , luton let 's face it ; the tory party is irrelevant in today 's politics .
i thought the leadership selection process was needlessly longwinded but i realise now it 's their only way of getting some front page coverage these days .
brian , bognor regis , w. sussex if peter howe of milton keynes thinks cameron is a toff , what does he think tony blair is ?
david r frost , london , england the race reveals that the conservative divisiveness disease is still rampant .
everyman for himself prevails .
notice the complete absence of any new ideas .
the whole campaign is on personality and perception of individual appeal potential .
based on these superficial criteria , mr cameron seems the best fit .
charles , sao paulo , brazil liam fox ... will give the public an alternative to blair sarah marshall , high wycombe i think liam fox is the best one for the job he is a good speaker and has experience of having been in the shadow cabinet under hague , duncan-smith and howard .
if he gets it he will give the public an alternative to blair .
sarah marshall , high wycombe it looks like a shoe-in for cameron and that is no bad thing .
another good thing is that the tories uphold the principle of democracy in their elections by letting mp 's and party members vote .
come on tony , lets see the labour party do likewise , instead of having a small clique sitting in smoke filled -lrb- sorry smoke free -rrb- rooms deciding what 's best .
james , bucks , uk boris johnson , without a doubt !
amanda , st andrews fife i 've never voted tory , but i 've always been on the fence .
if the next election is between mr cameron and mr brown then i 'll be ticking the box for the conservatives for the very first time .
christine , uk -lrb- i 'm sure dr fox would agree with this comment : -rrb- the reason why the tories have been in a mess over europe over the last ten years has been ken clarke - the foreign body in the wound , so to speak .
now that this source of infection has been treated -lrb- rejected -rrb- 3 times , perhaps this wound can now finally heal and the tories can be allowed to speak with one voice , moderately eurosceptic and pro-britain .
ap , newport , wales we 've had one vote and some fairly scientific polling amongst the membership .
why drag it out ?
surely the three surviving candidates should just sit down like grown-ups and agree the new team .
jonathan purle , bromley , uk as a labour voter , we need some decent opposition .
the only way to get that is to have someone who has no connection with the previous tory government , therefore david cameron would be the ideal candidate .
anon i 'm unlikely to ever vote conservative but after seeing just a brief clip of each of three remaining candidates only one of them came across as a ' normal ' person and that was liam fox .
max , bath , somerset i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq julian , london my political migration is nearly complete .
having backed the tories for fifteen years , this year i voted lib dem because of their stance on iraq .
now that i am faced with three pro-atlanticist potential tory leaders , gordon brown looks like an attractive option at the next election .
i shall be voting labour whoever leads the tories now .
julian , london how is this leadership contest any different from the previous contests ?
now kenneth clarke is out , we have three more candidates relatively unknown in the public eye .
i myself can still not match names to faces despite the tv coverage this has had the past month .
until the lib dems or tories manage to promote there shadow cabinet the way labour used to they are not going to gain popular support and traction with the public .
jamie caffrey , southampton i despair that people really care that one candidate or another is an old etonian .
that 's out of order , and is really irrelevant to the debate about who should be leader and whether or not they would be the next pm .
those people are naive in the extreme .
ken clarke would n't have won the next general election as leader of the conservative party , tony blair and co , would 've had a field day when talking about his past .
i think that cameron should be leader -lrb- even though davis is my local mp -rrb- .
at least then , blair will have to change tack from talking about when the tories were last in power , because he 's older than cameron is , and cameron was n't around then .
ken clarke should be heavily involved in shadow cabinet though .
oliver drew , howden , england among my non-conservative colleagues cameron is the person they view as the best of a strong field of candidates .
they are baffled by the claim that clarke appealed to the ' ordinary ' man and they view davies as too old .
the selection of cameron as leader and the demise of gordon brown 's facade hiding the real state of the uk economy will ensure a conservative victory at the next general election .
jeff , halesowen , uk ids , hague and now cameron , all peas from the same unelectable pod .
do the tories really believe that the average man in the street is going to vote for the old etonian toff ?
they must be totally stupid !
peter howe , milton keynes , england i hear we are heading for a complete u-turn in policy and again not putting candidates to a vote of the membership .
i-turn , u-turn , all tories turn ; and they are not even in government !
bill , telford , england i could n't care less who wins the leadership battle .
what is more important is policies along with a belief that for a change we can actually believe that the leopard of the tory party of the recent past -lrb- 1979 to 1987 -rrb- has changed it spots for the better for the people of this country .
i for one will take a lot of convincing .
