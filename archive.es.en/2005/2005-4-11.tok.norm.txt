ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .
stuttgart remain five points back of their bavarian rivals but only two behind the royal blues , making the fight for second-place anybody 's . dw staff -lrb- jk , win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german papers face free sheet assault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are still paying for their news for now swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .
but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here . " german papers battling falling readership germany 's numerous regional papers are seeing young readers desert in droves , although some are defecting to national papers that are beginning to follow the example of britain and produce daily editions in a condensed tabloid format , such as die welt kompakt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the little sister of the berlin-based broadsheet . the readership crisis follows a familiar pattern repeated around europe - between 80 and 85 percent of people aged 40 to 69 regularly read a daily newspaper in germany , but that percentage falls to 72 percent for people aged 30 to 39 and drops to 63 percent among 20 to 29-year-olds . bildunterschrift : even if its plans are little more than rumors , metro has got the german press world scared . the sector saw advertising revenue fall by a third between 2000 and 2004 .
and the arrival of a brash young rival in a market that has seen a modest recovery in advertising would not be welcome even in good times . " the competition between newspapers for a share of advertising revenue has become tougher and you have to wonder if there is enough money to go round if a new competitor enters the market , " pasquay said . former free paper chased out of town the only previous attempt to launch a free newspaper in germany failed after coming under intense pressure from the bigger press groups . in december 1999 , the norwegian group schibsted , which already publishes the successful 20 minutes free paper in france , launched a daily in the western city of cologne , handing out 150,000 copies at train stations and other distribution points .
but within two years , 20 minuten köln - as it was known in germany - had disappeared from the city 's streets . the local publisher dumont schauberg , which has a near monopoly over the press in the city on the rhine , and axel springer did everything in their power to prevent the new upstart from laying down roots .
their first move was to prevent schibsted from using any of the local presses and then they launched two rival free papers - which they promptly shut down as soon as 20 minutes had been chased out of town . the established groups also turned to the courts , but were sent packing after a ruling in 2003 that the free press had the right to operate in germany . german publishers too powerful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copies of the daily telegraph in london the success of metro 's free papers in other western european countries has forced established press groups in many countries into a rapid rethink - in britain , it is rumored that the paid-for london evening standard is considering going free to compete . but one media analyst told the afp news agency that the prospects of a free paper succeeding in germany remained slim .
" a daily free sheet has no chance in germany , " said the analyst , who asked not to be named .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german papers face free sheet assault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are still paying for their news for now swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .
but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .

the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .

he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .

the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here .

and the arrival of a brash young rival in a market that has seen a modest recovery in advertising would not be welcome even in good times . " the competition between newspapers for a share of advertising revenue has become tougher and you have to wonder if there is enough money to go round if a new competitor enters the market , " pasquay said . former free paper chased out of town the only previous attempt to launch a free newspaper in germany failed after coming under intense pressure from the bigger press groups . in december 1999 , the norwegian group schibsted , which already publishes the successful 20 minutes free paper in france , launched a daily in the western city of cologne , handing out 150,000 copies at train stations and other distribution points .
but within two years , 20 minuten köln - as it was known in germany - had disappeared from the city 's streets . the local publisher dumont schauberg , which has a near monopoly over the press in the city on the rhine , and axel springer did everything in their power to prevent the new upstart from laying down roots .
their first move was to prevent schibsted from using any of the local presses and then they launched two rival free papers - which they promptly shut down as soon as 20 minutes had been chased out of town . the established groups also turned to the courts , but were sent packing after a ruling in 2003 that the free press had the right to operate in germany . german publishers too powerful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copies of the daily telegraph in london the success of metro 's free papers in other western european countries has forced established press groups in many countries into a rapid rethink - in britain , it is rumored that the paid-for london evening standard is considering going free to compete . but one media analyst told the afp news agency that the prospects of a free paper succeeding in germany remained slim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .

the defendant , whose name was not released , admitted before the regional superior court in the southern german city of stuttgart to stabbing his sister 's lover to death in october 2004 to salvage his family 's honor .
he told the judges that he had demanded the man end the affair with his sister but said he only laughed at him .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german papers face free sheet assault großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are still paying for their news for now swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .
but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here . " german papers battling falling readership germany 's numerous regional papers are seeing young readers desert in droves , although some are defecting to national papers that are beginning to follow the example of britain and produce daily editions in a condensed tabloid format , such as die welt kompakt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the little sister of the berlin-based broadsheet . the readership crisis follows a familiar pattern repeated around europe - between 80 and 85 percent of people aged 40 to 69 regularly read a daily newspaper in germany , but that percentage falls to 72 percent for people aged 30 to 39 and drops to 63 percent among 20 to 29-year-olds . bildunterschrift : even if its plans are little more than rumors , metro has got the german press world scared . the sector saw advertising revenue fall by a third between 2000 and 2004 .
and the arrival of a brash young rival in a market that has seen a modest recovery in advertising would not be welcome even in good times . " the competition between newspapers for a share of advertising revenue has become tougher and you have to wonder if there is enough money to go round if a new competitor enters the market , " pasquay said . former free paper chased out of town the only previous attempt to launch a free newspaper in germany failed after coming under intense pressure from the bigger press groups . in december 1999 , the norwegian group schibsted , which already publishes the successful 20 minutes free paper in france , launched a daily in the western city of cologne , handing out 150,000 copies at train stations and other distribution points .
but within two years , 20 minuten köln - as it was known in germany - had disappeared from the city 's streets . the local publisher dumont schauberg , which has a near monopoly over the press in the city on the rhine , and axel springer did everything in their power to prevent the new upstart from laying down roots .
their first move was to prevent schibsted from using any of the local presses and then they launched two rival free papers - which they promptly shut down as soon as 20 minutes had been chased out of town . the established groups also turned to the courts , but were sent packing after a ruling in 2003 that the free press had the right to operate in germany . german publishers too powerful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copies of the daily telegraph in london the success of metro 's free papers in other western european countries has forced established press groups in many countries into a rapid rethink - in britain , it is rumored that the paid-for london evening standard is considering going free to compete . but one media analyst told the afp news agency that the prospects of a free paper succeeding in germany remained slim .
" a daily free sheet has no chance in germany , " said the analyst , who asked not to be named .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.04.2005 ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does my logo look big in this ?
the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago .

" airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .
and michael good and his mother will be there to watch . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .
an advertising campaign worth plenty of zeroes would be the bottom line . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eminem 's bum rap u.s. rapper eminem made an appearance on german television on tuesday and gave millions of viewers the chance to see a whole new side of him as he laid himself bare .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .
stuttgart remain five points back of their bavarian rivals but only two behind the royal blues , making the fight for second-place anybody 's . dw staff -lrb- jk , win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .
an advertising campaign worth plenty of zeroes would be the bottom line . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eminem 's bum rap u.s. rapper eminem made an appearance on german television on tuesday and gave millions of viewers the chance to see a whole new side of him as he laid himself bare .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .

"
russia is germany 's major oil and gas supplier . " this marks the transition to a completely new way of cooperating , " putin said , adding that the basf-gazprom project will stabilize energy supplies in europe and around the globe . german electronics firm siemens and russian railways on monday agreed to build 60 high speed trains in a deal worth 1.5 billion euros , putting in writing a contract that had already been announced during the german-russian summit in december . six other deals between german and russian companies were also signed on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .
" in football , nothing is impossible , " he said . hanspeter detmer -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .
and michael good and his mother will be there to watch . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .

german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .
" in football , nothing is impossible , " he said . hanspeter detmer -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .
" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .
meanwhile a business partner of khodorkovsky , leonid newslin , attacked schroeder in a separate interview with german news weekly focus .
" the people of germany , as opposed to -lrb- schröder -rrb- , understand what is happening in russia , " he said .
" there is no free justice in russia .
putin makes all the decisions .
" with the amount of lawlessness and energy that putin is using , yukos will be effectively bankrupt by this summer . " dw-world.de schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.04.2005 ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does my logo look big in this ?
the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .
" in football , nothing is impossible , " he said . hanspeter detmer -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .
aviation authorities are getting los angeles , new york 's john f. kennedy airport , san francisco and miami airports ready for a-380 passenger flights in 2006 , according to dave bennett of the federal aviation administration 's office of airport safety and standards . " i do n't see major safety or technical problems , " bennett said .

the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .
and michael good and his mother will be there to watch . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .
" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .
meanwhile a business partner of khodorkovsky , leonid newslin , attacked schroeder in a separate interview with german news weekly focus .
" the people of germany , as opposed to -lrb- schröder -rrb- , understand what is happening in russia , " he said .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.04.2005 ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does my logo look big in this ?
the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .

but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.04.2005 ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does my logo look big in this ?
the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .
an advertising campaign worth plenty of zeroes would be the bottom line . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eminem 's bum rap u.s. rapper eminem made an appearance on german television on tuesday and gave millions of viewers the chance to see a whole new side of him as he laid himself bare .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .

clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "

gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .

tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .

but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here . " german papers battling falling readership germany 's numerous regional papers are seeing young readers desert in droves , although some are defecting to national papers that are beginning to follow the example of britain and produce daily editions in a condensed tabloid format , such as die welt kompakt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the little sister of the berlin-based broadsheet . the readership crisis follows a familiar pattern repeated around europe - between 80 and 85 percent of people aged 40 to 69 regularly read a daily newspaper in germany , but that percentage falls to 72 percent for people aged 30 to 39 and drops to 63 percent among 20 to 29-year-olds . bildunterschrift : even if its plans are little more than rumors , metro has got the german press world scared . the sector saw advertising revenue fall by a third between 2000 and 2004 .
and the arrival of a brash young rival in a market that has seen a modest recovery in advertising would not be welcome even in good times . " the competition between newspapers for a share of advertising revenue has become tougher and you have to wonder if there is enough money to go round if a new competitor enters the market , " pasquay said . former free paper chased out of town the only previous attempt to launch a free newspaper in germany failed after coming under intense pressure from the bigger press groups . in december 1999 , the norwegian group schibsted , which already publishes the successful 20 minutes free paper in france , launched a daily in the western city of cologne , handing out 150,000 copies at train stations and other distribution points .
but within two years , 20 minuten köln - as it was known in germany - had disappeared from the city 's streets . the local publisher dumont schauberg , which has a near monopoly over the press in the city on the rhine , and axel springer did everything in their power to prevent the new upstart from laying down roots .
their first move was to prevent schibsted from using any of the local presses and then they launched two rival free papers - which they promptly shut down as soon as 20 minutes had been chased out of town . the established groups also turned to the courts , but were sent packing after a ruling in 2003 that the free press had the right to operate in germany . german publishers too powerful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copies of the daily telegraph in london the success of metro 's free papers in other western european countries has forced established press groups in many countries into a rapid rethink - in britain , it is rumored that the paid-for london evening standard is considering going free to compete . but one media analyst told the afp news agency that the prospects of a free paper succeeding in germany remained slim .
" a daily free sheet has no chance in germany , " said the analyst , who asked not to be named .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .
" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .
meanwhile a business partner of khodorkovsky , leonid newslin , attacked schroeder in a separate interview with german news weekly focus .
" the people of germany , as opposed to -lrb- schröder -rrb- , understand what is happening in russia , " he said .
" there is no free justice in russia .
putin makes all the decisions .
" with the amount of lawlessness and energy that putin is using , yukos will be effectively bankrupt by this summer . " dw-world.de schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2005 german reunification model not for seoul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president roh moo-hyun and his german counterpart horst köhler robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.04.2005 wind energy grows up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of offshore wind parks is expected to grow a new breeze is blowing for environmentally friendly wind energy , as industrial global players - including german firms - step in to help expand the market for the renewable resource . despite its bright promise , wind energy has taken a number of years to gain importance with major energy industry concerns .
the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .

" i do n't see major safety or technical problems , " bennett said .
o 'hare airport in chicago and dulles in washington will be ready later .
memphis in tennessee and anchorage in alaska should be ready for the cargo version of the a380 in 2008 .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .

" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .
meanwhile a business partner of khodorkovsky , leonid newslin , attacked schroeder in a separate interview with german news weekly focus .
" the people of germany , as opposed to -lrb- schröder -rrb- , understand what is happening in russia , " he said .
" there is no free justice in russia .
putin makes all the decisions .
" with the amount of lawlessness and energy that putin is using , yukos will be effectively bankrupt by this summer . " dw-world.de schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .
stuttgart remain five points back of their bavarian rivals but only two behind the royal blues , making the fight for second-place anybody 's . dw staff -lrb- jk , win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .

the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .

tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .
stuttgart remain five points back of their bavarian rivals but only two behind the royal blues , making the fight for second-place anybody 's . dw staff -lrb- jk , win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.04.2005 wind energy grows up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of offshore wind parks is expected to grow a new breeze is blowing for environmentally friendly wind energy , as industrial global players - including german firms - step in to help expand the market for the renewable resource . despite its bright promise , wind energy has taken a number of years to gain importance with major energy industry concerns .
the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .
it has also spoken out in favor of lifting existing us sanctions on its northern neighbor . roh will hope to find allies for his policy towards north korea in germany . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music conservatory puts its heart in seoul germany is known as an exporter of cars , precision machinery and beer .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .

it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .
" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .
anything less may not help the ailing club after a costly case .

clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's players reacting after 3-0 pasting of schalke schalke never got on track and their few first-half opportunities came on long passes up the middle .
gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's christian tiffert , right , stops schalke 's levan kobiashvili .
tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .
stuttgart remain five points back of their bavarian rivals but only two behind the royal blues , making the fight for second-place anybody 's . dw staff -lrb- jk , win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .

but it will face a fierce battle with the country 's established media groups . will germans soon be picking up a free newspaper at the train station on the way to work ?
it certainly sounded that way when metro boss pelle törnberg let slip in an interview in mid-february that " we want to enter the german market at some point . " the remarks unleashed a wave of rumors about the company 's intentions , which have been fuelled by the group 's refusal to discuss their plans . according to one rumor , the swedish company has signed a letter of intent with the german group axel springer with a view to cooperating on the venture .
others say metro it is about to link up with the giant westallgemeine zeitung -lrb- waz -rrb- publishing house in the ruhr area , germany 's industrial heartland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the welt kompakt metro 's thinking is not hard to fathom .
" if you do n't have a presence in germany , then you do n't have a presence in europe , " said anja pasquay , the spokeswoman for the german federation of newspaper producers -lrb- bdzv -rrb- . " with more than 22 daily newspapers , it is the fifth-biggest press market in the world and the biggest in europe in terms of circulation , " pasquay said .
" it is obvious in that context that a group like metro looks at what is happening and asks what it can do here .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .

the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .
and michael good and his mother will be there to watch . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing a blow to holocaust deniers deborah lipstadt never took the stand during the landmark libel case she won against british holocaust denier david irving .

the two firms have agreed to jointly develop the yuzhno-russkoye gas field in western siberia , making basf the first german company to get access to russia 's enormous gas reserves . the deal includes investments worth $ 1 billion -lrb- 770.8 million euros -rrb- , basf ceo jürgen habrecht said , adding that another joint project , a baltic sea pipeline , will be worth another $ 2 billion . german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , who attended the signing ceremony , described the deal as " historic . "
russia is germany 's major oil and gas supplier . " this marks the transition to a completely new way of cooperating , " putin said , adding that the basf-gazprom project will stabilize energy supplies in europe and around the globe . german electronics firm siemens and russian railways on monday agreed to build 60 high speed trains in a deal worth 1.5 billion euros , putting in writing a contract that had already been announced during the german-russian summit in december . six other deals between german and russian companies were also signed on monday .

" the state will ensure that these conditions are further improved .
we will also modernize the tax system and cut bureaucracy . " a concrete cooperation offer putin called on german companies to invest more in russia , saying he regarded the hanover fair not only as a window for russian industry but also as a concrete offer of cooperation . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin at the fair on monday some 150 russian exhibitors are putting their goods and services on display in hanover - the biggest-ever participation by a partner-country .
russian exhibitors will also be demonstrating their strength in aircraft construction , including the new medium-range jet , rrj .
the jet is scheduled to have its maiden flight at the end of 2006 .
schröder underlined the basic conditions for a joint future that he said went beyond economic ties . " with the close strategic partnership we want to prevent a repetition ever again of the fateful chapters in our history , " he said .
" we want to shape our future jointly in a europe that is growing together .
and that is only possible if the european union forms a strategic partnership with russia and then expands it both politically and economically . " russia boosts german export the president of the federal association of german industry , jürgen thumann , who was also present at the opening ceremony , recalled that exports are traditionally considered to be the german economy ’ s growth motor , with exporting firms making up nearly 40 percent of the country 's gross national product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : containers are prepared for overseas shipment in bremerhaven 's port " in 2004 , german exports were spurred on in particular by one country , russia , " thumann said .

robert amsterdam told the daily berliner zeitung that the german government had backed two german banks - deutsche bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein -lrb- dkw -rrb- - in helping moscow dismantle yukos . khodorkovsky is on trial on tax evasion and embezzlement charges in a high-profile case his defenders say is politically motivated .
" the german chancellor acted as a kremlin accomplice in a case of theft committed by the russian leadership , " amsterdam said , according to comments printed in german .
" that is a crime and i plan to spend a lot of time uncovering the german government 's involvement . "
amsterdam accused schröder , who was meeting with russian president vladimir putin in the northern german city of hanover monday , of acting out of " pure opportunism " in supporting the kremlin in the yukos case to gain " commercial advantage from an illegal deal . "
deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , and dkw were part of a consortium of banks that had intended to put up funding for russian state-owned gas giant gazprom to buy yuganskneftegaz , which produces 60 percent of yukoss oil , at an auction in december .
meanwhile a business partner of khodorkovsky , leonid newslin , attacked schroeder in a separate interview with german news weekly focus .
" the people of germany , as opposed to -lrb- schröder -rrb- , understand what is happening in russia , " he said .
" there is no free justice in russia .
putin makes all the decisions .
" with the amount of lawlessness and energy that putin is using , yukos will be effectively bankrupt by this summer . " dw-world.de schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .

german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.04.2005 ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does my logo look big in this ?
the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

ten minutes earlier , maik wagefeld secured the lead for nuremberg with a long-range strike .
he also scored the third goal two minutes from time . while nuremberg is now in relative safety from being relegated to germany 's second-tier league , rostock still has to fear about its bundesliga future .
only six games are left to play in the season and only freiburg ranks even lower than rostock , with bochum a third candidate for transfer to the second-level bundesliga . also on sunday , kaiserslautern under its new coach , hans-werner moser , beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 .
neither game did anything to change things at the top , where bayern munich looks like the likely season winner after saturday 's 3-0 victory over the second contender , schalke .
the pressure from the stuttgart fans had been growing .
kevin kuranyi last scored for vfb on february 2 .
since then , the striker disappeared from the scene . but that ended on saturday and in grand fashion when kuranyi scored a hat trick and led stuttgart to victory .
the first goal , 569 minutes since his last strike , came in the 15th minute and that thanks to former teammate marcelo bordon .
the solidly-built and usually dependable central defender transferred to schalke after last season but he let a cross go through his legs and kuranyi could finally end his scoring drought .
" i made a mistake , everyone made mistakes , " said bordon on television broadcaster premiere after the match .
" -lrb- the loss -rrb- was our own fault . "

gerald asamoah was stopped by keeper timo hildebrand in the 19th minute .
ailton had the best chance in the 21st minute .
he put on the afterburners from 40 meters out , watched two stuttgart defenders crash into each other , and evaded hildebrand .
just before his shot reached the net from the left side , alexander hleb cleared it off the line .
after that , schalke seemed at a loss over how to crack the stuttgart defense that never truly faltered in the match .
poor second-half start spells end for schalke referee wolfgang stark had just blown the whistle to start the second-half but schalke seemed not to hear it .
just two minutes after the start , vfb 's hleb won a ball at midfield and sped down the left wing .

tiffert assisted on two of kevin kuranyi 's goals his cross went all the way across the field to christian tiffert .
he tapped it back to andreas hinkel who had ample time to send the ball to an uncovered kevin kuranyi who headed the ball into the net .
at that point , stuttgart seemed satisfied with the lead and retreated into their end .
schalke attempted to put something together but had to watch hleb start another brilliant counterattack in the 63rd minute .
he found tiffert on the right side who in turn saw kevin kuranyi again uncovered in the middle .
he coolly moved into the penalty box and sunk the leather into the net against schalke keeper frank rost who was helpless in stopping the ball .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi had gone 569 minutes without celebrating a goal - that changed in spades today only minutes afterwards , schalke 's midfielder lincoln was sent off the pitch for a second bookable offense and the game took on a scrimmage-like quality for the final 20 minutes .
schalke 's strikers ailton , mike hanke and gerald asamoah , proved harmless most of the match .
" we never gave schalke a chance , " kuranyi told television channel premiere .
with the loss , schalke are now three points behind league-leaders bayern munich .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts . while sitting over drinks one day at their favorite bar , jürgen scholz , the chairman of the down-at-heel amateur bundesliga team arminia hanover , and a friend were discussing ways of turning around the financial fortunes of the floundering club .
scholz complained to his friend , a boutique owner , that the cupboard was very nearly bare and that the team was in dire need of some new sources of income . spotting an entrepreneurial opportunity , scholz 's pal suggested that his range of locally patriotic slogan wear - casual fashion items bearing the standard ' kanzlerstadt ' , a reference to hanover as gerhard schröder 's home base - could prove a suitable sponsor .
however , thanks in part to the inspiring brew on tap ; the decision was also made to carry the new sponsor not on the team shirts but on their shorts … on the back . this meeting of great minds and strong beer resulted in arminia hanover taking to the field at the start of the 2003/04 season with the word ' kanzlerstadt ' displayed across the bottoms of the starting 11 .
-lrb- the logo was also on the backsides of the substitutes but as they were warming the bench at the time , it was n't as provocative -rrb- .
however , german soccer was not ready for such an innovative advertising deal and so the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- gave the deal the bum rush , taking the club to court . dfb says ' no butts ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the statute of german soccer rules , advertising can only be displayed on the shirts and only on the chest region and arms .
as the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo was being displayed some way further south and towards the back , arminia hanover were hit by a series of 300 euro fines by the legal arm of the lower saxony soccer association .
this did nothing to dissuade scholz that he was doing anything wrong and he vowed to advertise in any way he saw fit . now the case has resurfaced due to scholz 's desire to get his teams bottoms out in front .
the arminia hanover chairman is suing the dfb in the district court in frankfurt in a bid to overturn the statute book on the positioning of advertising . euro rivals proudly display their sponsors it seems that the dfb may be in danger of getting their shorts in a twist over the case .
many professional teams have hinted that a changing of the rules would be welcomed , allowing more revenue into clubs through advertising below the belt line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon are just one of the french teams in ligue 1 who enjoy multiple sponsors .
clubs in france , belgium and spain have already experimented with advertising in places other than on the front and arms of shirts while players in austria often turn out looking more like walking billboards than soccer stars . in july 2003 , fifa , world soccer 's governing body , ruled that it would make official an unwritten agreement that advertising could be placed in places on a soccer uniform other than on the shirt front or arms .
this , if applied to the frankfurt case , may catch the dfb with its pants down . court case could pave way for bottom logos while associations can make their own regulations on such things , it seems strange to jürgen scholz that the dfb continues to maintain its ' no butt adverts ' hard line .
" tomorrow they could rule out long hair or white soccer boots , " scholz laments .
" why does bottom advertising provoke the dfb so much and not the austrian or spanish ? " since beginning his legal struggle to release bottoms from their dfb-enforced constraints , the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo has been removed from the shorts of arminia hanover .
if the dfb regulation is overturned , the bums of hanover will once again display a sponsor - but it may not be the ' kanzlerstadt ' logo . scholz is looking for a sponsor who could inject about 15,000 euros per season into the club .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state . " for now , everything is suspended , " an airbus spokeswoman said when questioned about the date when airbus would seek state aid .
" everyone is in a holding pattern . " the total cost of the program is estimated at 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- .
airbus chief executive noel forgeard said in late december that he would ask for reimbursable aid of up to 33 percent of the program from the four eu member states participating in the project : britain , france , germany and spain . us airports prepare for a380 bildunterschrift : the new airbus a380 superjumbo is seen after the unveiling ceremony near toulouse , southwestern france , tuesday jan.18 , 2005 . the row has not stopped us airports preparing for the arrival of the a380 jet .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .
" in football , nothing is impossible , " he said . hanspeter detmer -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .
" in football , nothing is impossible , " he said . hanspeter detmer -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

if the organizers of germany 's first convention on women 's and girls ' soccer have their way , the answer is yes . women in germany have played soccer -lrb- or football , if you prefer -rrb- for nearly 40 years .
and they have reached some incredible goals along the way .
german women have been european league champions more than once , have won bronze medals at the olympic games in sydney and athens , and took home their first world title in 2003 .
of course , no one can claim that women 's soccer is anywhere near as established as men 's , in terms of ticket sales , career opportunities , celebrity , or public interest .
and unfortunately , just wishing for something hard enough does n't make it true .
rhetoric vs. reality but someone may want to tell that to sepp blatter .
the president of fifa , soccer 's international governing body , chose the motto " the future of soccer is female " for the first-ever women 's and girls ' soccer convention , which took place over the weekend in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's viola odebrecht -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with nigeria 's perpetua nkwocha august 2004 .
rhetoric ran high among attendees .
german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .
but i think there is a potential for the number of girls who play soccer to double in the coming years , " wopp told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .
he also has high hopes that the ongoing restructuring of the german school system will give a boost to the sport .
as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .
a woman at the top ?
for his part , the football association 's zwanziger said his interest in promoting women 's soccer was kindled by his five-year-old granddaughter , paula .
growing up in a football-rich environment , she will most likely expect to play one day , zwanziger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play - in tehran " we have done everything we can to give boys and girls the same conditions , to see that girls can play as well as boys , " he said .
would these " same conditions " someday extend into the upper levels of german football politics ?
in other words , could there ever be a female president of the german football association ?
zwanziger does n't reject the idea outright .

german football association president theo zwanziger , most likely referring to the recent successes of germany 's female national team , said : " the time is ripe to visibly increase the number of girls in our football clubs .
we here at the top -lrb- of the organization -rrb- have done all we can to bring attention to the fact that girls can play football just as well as boys can . "
but this positive outlook can be hard to sustain when compared with data gathered by sport researcher and sociologist christian wopp , from the university of osnabrück .
of 3.5 million school age girls in germany , just 220,000 play the game .
on the up side , the number of girl players has grown over the past five to eight years in germany , and wopp expects that trend to continue .
high hopes for school sports " around 5 percent of girls play soccer , compared to 38 percent of boys .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's birgit prinz led the women 's team to athens in 2004 the growth potential is mostly found in the immigrant population , wopp said .

as schooldays grow longer , more children will come in contact with school-run sports -lrb- as opposed to sports run by local nonprofit clubs , as is currently most often the case -rrb- .
" the girls can try out this relatively new sport in the protective environment of the school , " wopp said .
however , wopp noted that he expects the growth to stay mostly among younger girls .
unlike the case with men and soccer , it is very unlikely that a large number of women will continue to play the sport as they get older , wopp said .
the only way this could change is if some of the game 's basic rules were altered - by limiting body contact and using a slower ball , for instance .
rough play - associated with injury - would need to be replaced by an emphasis on fitness and technique .

" while there is a chance to negotiate and to avoid dispute we should try to make good use of this period , " she said , but added : " this period can not drag on for too long because there are important commercial interests at stake . " " ceasefire " expired monday on jan .
11 , the us and the eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies , agreeing in the meantime not to extend any fresh subsidies or to seek wto arbitration .
that deadline expired monday . the attempt to strike a negotiated accord came after both sides pulled back from the brink of action to the wto , which both brussels and washington agree would seriously escalate the political significance of the row . the eu commission spokeswoman declined to say how long further negotiations could continue , but insisted that the european bloc has no plans to take wto action . " both parties are free to return to the wto or provide wto legal support to their manufacturers , " she said , but added : " we 've also said that we do not currently intend to initiate a dispute to the wto . " sour personal relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert b. zoellick forging a breakthrough in the airbus-boeing row has not been helped by strained relations between the eu 's mandelson and washington 's negotiator robert zoellick , who got on famously with mandelson 's predecessor , pascal lamy . zoellick , the number two at the us state department and until recently us trade representative , said he was " willing " to extend the 90-day cease-fire period to try to reach a deal . but he also maintained the threat of bringing the dispute before the wto if europe refused to abandon aid for the launch of airbus ' new long-range , mid-sized a350 , destined to rival boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . veron-reville said that discussions between brussels and washington were continuing , despite an abruptly-ended phone conversation between mandelson and zoellick two weeks ago . " discusions at official level are going on .
they have never really stopped , " she said .
" when the time is right for it , we will resume discussion at official negotiator level . " airbus suspends request for state aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus production in hamburg the eu commission spokeswoman sidestepped a report in monday 's financial times that the eu had offered to delay launch aid for the a350 to avoid what would be the biggest battle in the wto 's history . " if airbus makes a request to -lrb- eu -rrb- member states for launch investment this is for member states to consider , " she said . asked how long talks could continue after the end of the 90-day deadline , she said : " there is no new standstill period , " adding : " i will not get into the details of the length of this pause for further reflection . " airbus officials on monday meanwhile said they had suspended a request for state .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

on monday , the israeli holocaust memorial committee will give him one of its highest honors . " righteous among the nations " is the title israel 's holocaust memorial council at yad vashem bestows on people who risked their lives to save jews from death at the hands of the nazis .
to date , the country has given the award to 20,570 people .
just 410 of them were german , and of these , just a handful were military personnel .
on monday , thanks to the historical research efforts of a child of concentration camp survivors , german army officer named karl plagge will be posthumously given the award .
michael good , a family physician in the u.s. state of connecticut , says major plagge saved his mother and seven other members of his family from sure death , along with hundreds of other inhabitants of the jewish ghetto in vilnius , lithuania .
' essential ' mending good said a trip with his parents back to vilnius in 1999 piqued his curiosity about how his family survived that era , when so many others perished .
before the trip , good admits , he did not have much interest in his own heritage .
but when his mother told him about her time in the ghetto and how she was saved by a german officer , he began using the internet to dig into the past , finding other survivors to corroborate his mother 's story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major karl plagge what good found was this : just a week before the ghetto was purged by the germans in september , 1943 , plagge commandeered some 1,000 jews to work in an military-vehicle maintenance camp outside the ghetto , keeping them safe from death squads .
both good 's mother and grandfather survived the purge in this way .
good has pointed out to various interviewers that his grandfather " could n't change a lightbulb , " and that his mother 's task was darning socks for soldiers .
but by listing them as " essential workers , " plagge saved their lives , good claims .
it took good six years of long-distance searching to find other survivors from plagge 's life-saving scheme , but eventually he succeeded .
along with marianne viefhaus , an archivist from the university of darmstadt in germany , he was able to complete the picture of a german whose courage saved several hundred jews from certain death .
last warning a number of the workers ' last memories of plagge was shortly before the red army was to enter vilnius , in july 1944 .
according to several survivors , plagge performed one last heroic act .
in the presence of ss officers , he gave the prisoners a veiled warning when he said they would be " escorted during this evacuation by the ss , which , as you know , is an organization devoted to the protection of refugees .
thus , there 's nothing to worry about . "
many of the inmates took this as a sign to run away or hide , thus saving their lives .
william begell , a survivor who was then just 17 years old , was interviewed by good for a book he wrote called " the search for major plagge . "
he said he understood the warning , and jumped out a window to escape evacuation by the nazis .
bildunterschrift : yad vashem holocaust memorial good said he sought the yad vashem honor for plagge after he found out the german had no relatives he could thank directly .
he told england 's guardian newspaper that during their trip to vilnius , his mother was " waving her cane around and saying ' he was better than schindler . " '
still , good 's attempt to have plagge named " righteous among the nations " met with resistance at first .
yad vashem did not accept that plagge had put himself in harm 's way , since the german military had endorsed using jewish slave labor to support the war effort .
but on the third try , having gathered yet more material in support of his subject , he succeeded .
plagge was put on trial after the war , like thousands of other germans .
trial transcripts show former prisoners and subordinates vouched for him , but he insisted on being classified as having some complicity .
plagge died in 1957 in his hometown of darmstadt , at age 59 .
after the war , he was said to be burdened by guilt at not having saved more people from the nazis .
at monday 's ceremony in israel , plagge 's name will be inscribed on a garden wall , not far from trees honoring oskar schindler , raoul wallenberg and others who risked their " lives , freedom or safety " to save jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.04.2005 wind energy grows up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of offshore wind parks is expected to grow a new breeze is blowing for environmentally friendly wind energy , as industrial global players - including german firms - step in to help expand the market for the renewable resource . despite its bright promise , wind energy has taken a number of years to gain importance with major energy industry concerns .
the us conglomerate general electric was the first to dive into the market wholeheartedly in 2002 . then german giant siemens followed suit in late 2004 by buying danish wind turbine maker bonus energy .
now the munich-based firm is planning to gain customers worldwide with its newly acquired technology . such developments have pleased martin kühn , a wind energy expert at the university of stuttgart . " i see it as positive that another large global player has jumped into this new market , " he said .
" that makes plain that this market is interesting for companies that have clear expectations for profits and that this sector is finally ready for prime time . " it remains a very concentrated field , with only five firms accounting for more than 80 percent of the world 's wind energy market .
besides ge , the german firm enercon , denmark 's vestas , spain 's gamesa and now siemens dominate the show . energy giant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up until recently , the name siemens stood for any kind of energy production except for the renewable kind .
the firm earns billions with traditional energy technology with large turbines for gas and nuclear power plants . but that looks set to change now .
andreas nauen , head of the siemens wind energy unit , said the company plans to double its business in the sector by 2008 or 2009 .
that would add up to sales of 600 million euros -lrb- $ 775.5 million -rrb- .
and the company is n't just limiting its plans to europe .
by taking over westinghouse , siemens hopes to tackle the us market , which is currently dominated by ge wind energy . " i do n't see any major problems , " nauen said .
" by taking over westinghouse we have a fantastic platform for the usa , which we will use to sell wind turbines there . " alongside wind turbines on land , siemens also wants to get part of the action in so-called offshore-turbines .
there are already two large danish wind parks that use bonus energy turbines in the baltic sea . wind expert kühn expects plenty of opportunities for such sea-based parks in the future . " the firm bonus has a great reputation internationally , a large export market share and robust technology in the offshore sector , " he said , adding that siemens ' financial firepower and the firm 's further expertise would only make it a stronger international competitor . ralf köpke -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification . last year the total export volume between seoul and berlin reached an all-time high at $ 16.8 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- .
for south korea , germany remains the biggest trading partner within the european union , for germany , seoul is the third-largest in asia . but , it 's not just excellent business relations that bind the two countries .
they also share a much deeper link through their common experience of what it meant to be a politically and militarily divided country .
the difference is that while germany was reunited in 1989 , a border still divides communist north korea and the industrial nation of south korea ever since the korean war of 1950-1953 . lessons from german reunification as south korean president roh moo-hyun arrives in germany on sunday for a five-day trip , reunification is expected to find mention in political talks between the two sides .
at the same time , experts say that germany , which was once seen as a great model in south korea , has lost some of its shine . " south korea has finally drawn conclusions from german reunification : one can not pull it off so quickly and in such a chaotic manner , " said kay möller of the foundation for science and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" south korea has drawn its lesson : ' if we do the same thing , we 'll be ruined economically ' , " möller added . patrick köller of the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg agrees that the seoul-berlin relationship has sobered up .
" the euphoria in south korea over its own reunification has sharply evaporated , " said köller .
" that 's because of the economic factor . " germany is still struggling with the astronomic costs of absorbing five poor states of the former communist east germany and injects billions yearly in them to improve infrastructure and bring them up to the standards of western states . when asked in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung whether germany 's reunification seemed exemplary or instead daunting , roh said diplomatically , " the korean peninsula needs a slower and longer process . " instead , roh is using the five-day trip to advertise his country under the " korea year 2005 " in germany .
as part of the program , south korea will play host at this year 's asia pacific week in berlin in september .
a further highlight will be south korea 's pivotal role at this year 's prestigious frankfurt book fair in october . limited german role experts however do n't expect anything concrete on the matter of the ongoing stand-off over north korea 's nuclear ambitions , other than berlin stressing the importance of six-party talks and pyongyang 's renouncement of its nuclear program . " the eu has failed on the subject and germany is hardly in a position to exert influence , " möller said .
he added that of the five countries negotiation with north korea - china , japan , russia , south korea and the us - none was interested in involving the eu . instead , roh is trying to find international support for reviving his own policy of détente between pyongyang and seoul .
experts say that though the us remains south korea 's most important ally in the nuclear stand-off with north korea , the us insistence on a swift reversal of pyongyang 's uranium and plutonium program and un sanctions against the country if necessary , is n't widely shared in south korea . seoul instead wants to apply less pressure on pyongyang and instead offer it incentives for gradually dismantling its nuclear program .

european negotiators are keen to avert a possible economic showdown at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- .
both sides have missed an 11 april deadline to reach an accord on cutting support to airbus and boeing .
the eu and us accuse each other of boosting their industries with illegal state subsidies .
however , both have expressed a willingness to negotiate beyond monday 's deadline .
standing ready eu negotiators said there was still a period of weeks to reach a deal with washington in order to prevent the issue going to the wto .
" i stand ready to continue negotiation , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
" the eu remains interested in reaching an initial agreement that reduces the levels of government support in this sector and completing a comprehensive agreement in the longer term , " he said .
the dispute between the two sides intensified after airbus started producing what will become the world 's largest passenger plane , the a380 superjumbo .
fresh aid the us accuses the eu of having funded the project with generous subsidies , while the eu claims that boeing is receiving similar help in the us for its mid-sized 7e7 , now 787 dreamliner plane .
on 11 january , the us government and eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies instead of suing each other through the wto .
however , time remains tight for a negotiated settlement , as monday 's deadline ends a standstill agreement between the eu and us on fresh subsidies to their airline makers .
airbus is expected to seek about $ 1.6bn -lrb- 1.2bn euros ; £ 848m -rrb- in european state aid for the launch of its proposed a350 passenger jet , which would rival boeing 's dreamliner .
such a move would probably lead the us to take legal action at the wto , if an agreement is not reached beforehand .
korean air , south korea 's biggest carrier , announced on monday that it has signed a deal to buy 10 boeing 787 dreamliner plans for $ 1.3bn.
the first of the planes are set for delivery in 2009 .

european negotiators are keen to avert a possible economic showdown at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- .
both sides have missed an 11 april deadline to reach an accord on cutting support to airbus and boeing .
the eu and us accuse each other of boosting their industries with illegal state subsidies .
however , both have expressed a willingness to negotiate beyond monday 's deadline .
standing ready eu negotiators said there was still a period of weeks to reach a deal with washington in order to prevent the issue going to the wto .
boeing hopes to counter airbus with its mid-sized 787 dreamliner " i stand ready to continue negotiation , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
" the eu remains interested in reaching an initial agreement that reduces the levels of government support in this sector and completing a comprehensive agreement in the longer term , " he said .
the dispute between the two sides intensified after airbus started producing what will become the world 's largest passenger plane , the a380 superjumbo .
fresh aid the us accuses the eu of having funded the project with generous subsidies , while the eu claims that boeing is receiving similar help in the us for its mid-sized 7e7 , now 787 dreamliner plane .
on 11 january , the us government and eu gave themselves 90 days to resolve their dispute over aircraft subsidies instead of suing each other through the wto .
however , time remains tight for a negotiated settlement , as monday 's deadline ends a standstill agreement between the eu and us on fresh subsidies to their airline makers .
airbus is expected to seek about $ 1.6bn -lrb- 1.2bn euros ; £ 848m -rrb- in european state aid for the launch of its proposed a350 passenger jet , which would rival boeing 's dreamliner .
such a move would probably lead the us to take legal action at the wto , if an agreement is not reached beforehand .
korean air , south korea 's biggest carrier , announced on monday that it has signed a deal to buy 10 boeing 787 dreamliner plans for $ 1.3bn.
the first of the planes are set for delivery in 2009 .

capita symonds were hired by bath and north east somerset council -lrb- banes -rrb- to finish the ill-fated project .
the previous builders , mowlem , were dismissed by banes in a surprise move last week .
banes and mowlem have been locked in a bitter dispute over the project , which is nearly three years behind schedule after a series of technical problems .
capita symonds ' portfolio includes the new wembley stadium and twickenham rugby ground .
' substantial claim ' but a mowlem spokesman said the contractor may not leave the site and insists that by forcing it to go , the council is breaching its contract .
last week mowlem said the council had exposed itself to a " substantial claim " .
capita symonds staff plan to spend the first few weeks checking the state of the spa building .
then it will work out a schedule to advance the project , hiring sub-contractors to finish the job .

while the majority still seek out sites of interest through search engines and keep addresses bookmarked , others increasingly use " rss " feeds .
rss stands for really simple syndication .
it is a way of keeping automatically aware of website updates .
like sushi restaurant conveyor belts , it delivers content to people so they can easily pick what they want to read .
rss feeds -lrb- really simple syndication -rrb- explained millions of news , weblogs , and ordinary websites carry easy-to-set-up rss feeds which alert people when a site has been updated .
keen lovers of technology and the web have been using rss for some time as a way to wade through the millions of pages on the web .
it is now starting to come out of its niche ; and the small , orange badges which indicate a feed is available on a site are becoming a familiar presence .
but many people who use the web fairly regularly will still stare blankly when asked whether they use rss .
next step portals like bt yahoo broadband are starting to push and explain it , to get more people using it .
bt sees it as the next step in customisation .
dave winer , co-inventor of the rss format , describes it in three simple words - automated web surfing .
" if you find there is a regular pattern to the way you look at websites , and imagine a computer could do some of that work for you , that is what rss does for you , " he explained to the bbc news website .
we are still waiting for the killer app though .
we are still waiting for someone to produce the software that will switch the lightbulb on for people dave winer " i am reading a website so often , i just want the website to tell me when something new is there . "
his feeds include weather updates from everywhere he has lived in the last five years , to netflix feeds which alert him to new dvd releases , and a lot of other blogs or websites on which he wants to keep tabs .
" the information we expect today is much greater than what we had in the past .
rss makes it possible for information to flow to you , " according to mr winer .
free programs available on the net collect all the rss feeds which users want .
they essentially let users read dozens of websites , all on the same page .
and some net browsers - such as firefox and opera - let users add feeds that can be viewed inside the one program , without having to open a separate window .
" with the aggregator -lsb- reader -rsb- i use , it 's like sitting on a riverbank and watching the water go by .
" on that water are little paper boards floating by .
if i see something i am interested in , i click on it .
" it is very easy for me to scan with my eyes .
using a computer has trained me to do that better , " he explained .
rivers and boats net service providers and web portals , like bt yahoo , are also realising its potential and are making rss an integral part of how the portals work .
bt yahoo 's portal for its net customers has used rss before , but it was not made explicit to people .
as part of a revamp last month , it makes it clearly accessible for all , with a button to " add content " .
but a big issue has been about how to explain what rss can do to change a person 's web surfing experience , and also how to avoid bamboozling people with strange-looking code and acronyms .
bt yahoo says it is the first net service provider to use rss on its portal " our industry is brilliant at coming up with these ridiculous acronyms , and we are rapidly getting to the same place with rss , " jo baxter , general manager of bt openworld online services , told the bbc news website .
" we always have an explanation for customers in terms of what it can offer them .
" what we are constantly looking to do with the browser is create a place where people can get all the relevant information they want in one hit . "
in the first few days after the overhauled portal was launched , 20,000 people used the " add content " button .
' like skiing ' although there are many different readers available , mr winer thinks there is an opportunity for news organisations and other content providers to provide their own readers for people to personalise the web .
some are moving that way already , with most major news sites offering feeds .
the la times , and the uk 's guardian are already offering their own branded rss reader programs .
for now , however , mr winer sees rss as a development for the web which is a revolution that is not disruptive .
it levels the playing field for all kinds of content producers to get what they produce out into the world .
news readers collect all your feeds and display the updates on the same page but he is not sure it needs to be a " mass market thing " just yet .
" it 's like skiing .
as popular as it is , probably less than 5 % of people do it .
imagine if everyone did it , it would be scary , " he thinks .
but as technology and media companies start to use rss more explicitly , encouraging readers to use the feeds to stay updated , it will most likely go that way .
" we are still waiting for the killer app though .
we are still waiting for someone to produce the software that will switch the lightbulb on for people . "
it could be that news providers are in the best position to produce that " killer app " for people .
they have a chance of understanding news , but technology companies do not , says mr winer .
it may be that people just do not want to be updated every minute of every day when there is something new to read .
that could lead to information overload .
mr winer does not think so : " it redefines information overload and moves the bar higher . "
" now it takes more information for you to be overloaded .
it just means you can consume 100 times more before you go crazy . "

it could be that news providers are in the best position to produce that " killer app " for people .

it may be that people just do not want to be updated every minute of every day when there is something new to read .
that could lead to information overload .
mr winer does not think so : " it redefines information overload and moves the bar higher . "

keen lovers of technology and the web have been using rss for some time as a way to wade through the millions of pages on the web .

while the majority still seek out sites of interest through search engines and keep addresses bookmarked , others increasingly use " rss " feeds .
rss stands for really simple syndication .
it is a way of keeping automatically aware of website updates .
like sushi restaurant conveyor belts , it delivers content to people so they can easily pick what they want to read .
rss feeds -lrb- really simple syndication -rrb- explained millions of news , weblogs , and ordinary websites carry easy-to-set-up rss feeds which alert people when a site has been updated .
keen lovers of technology and the web have been using rss for some time as a way to wade through the millions of pages on the web .
it is now starting to come out of its niche ; and the small , orange badges which indicate a feed is available on a site are becoming a familiar presence .
but many people who use the web fairly regularly will still stare blankly when asked whether they use rss .
next step portals like bt yahoo broadband are starting to push and explain it , to get more people using it .
bt sees it as the next step in customisation .
dave winer , co-inventor of the rss format , describes it in three simple words - automated web surfing .
" if you find there is a regular pattern to the way you look at websites , and imagine a computer could do some of that work for you , that is what rss does for you , " he explained to the bbc news website .
we are still waiting for the killer app though .
we are still waiting for someone to produce the software that will switch the lightbulb on for people dave winer " i am reading a website so often , i just want the website to tell me when something new is there . "
his feeds include weather updates from everywhere he has lived in the last five years , to netflix feeds which alert him to new dvd releases , and a lot of other blogs or websites on which he wants to keep tabs .
" the information we expect today is much greater than what we had in the past .
rss makes it possible for information to flow to you , " according to mr winer .
free programs available on the net collect all the rss feeds which users want .
they essentially let users read dozens of websites , all on the same page .
and some net browsers - such as firefox and opera - let users add feeds that can be viewed inside the one program , without having to open a separate window .
" with the aggregator -lsb- reader -rsb- i use , it 's like sitting on a riverbank and watching the water go by .
" on that water are little paper boards floating by .
if i see something i am interested in , i click on it .
" it is very easy for me to scan with my eyes .
using a computer has trained me to do that better , " he explained .
rivers and boats net service providers and web portals , like bt yahoo , are also realising its potential and are making rss an integral part of how the portals work .
bt yahoo 's portal for its net customers has used rss before , but it was not made explicit to people .
as part of a revamp last month , it makes it clearly accessible for all , with a button to " add content " .
but a big issue has been about how to explain what rss can do to change a person 's web surfing experience , and also how to avoid bamboozling people with strange-looking code and acronyms .
bt yahoo says it is the first net service provider to use rss on its portal " our industry is brilliant at coming up with these ridiculous acronyms , and we are rapidly getting to the same place with rss , " jo baxter , general manager of bt openworld online services , told the bbc news website .
" we always have an explanation for customers in terms of what it can offer them .
" what we are constantly looking to do with the browser is create a place where people can get all the relevant information they want in one hit . "
in the first few days after the overhauled portal was launched , 20,000 people used the " add content " button .
' like skiing ' although there are many different readers available , mr winer thinks there is an opportunity for news organisations and other content providers to provide their own readers for people to personalise the web .
some are moving that way already , with most major news sites offering feeds .
the la times , and the uk 's guardian are already offering their own branded rss reader programs .
for now , however , mr winer sees rss as a development for the web which is a revolution that is not disruptive .
it levels the playing field for all kinds of content producers to get what they produce out into the world .
news readers collect all your feeds and display the updates on the same page but he is not sure it needs to be a " mass market thing " just yet .
" it 's like skiing .
as popular as it is , probably less than 5 % of people do it .
imagine if everyone did it , it would be scary , " he thinks .
but as technology and media companies start to use rss more explicitly , encouraging readers to use the feeds to stay updated , it will most likely go that way .
" we are still waiting for the killer app though .
we are still waiting for someone to produce the software that will switch the lightbulb on for people . "
it could be that news providers are in the best position to produce that " killer app " for people .
they have a chance of understanding news , but technology companies do not , says mr winer .
it may be that people just do not want to be updated every minute of every day when there is something new to read .
that could lead to information overload .
mr winer does not think so : " it redefines information overload and moves the bar higher . "
" now it takes more information for you to be overloaded .
it just means you can consume 100 times more before you go crazy . "

campaigners say the pope 's stance on condoms cost lives during his lifetime , pope john paul ii drew criticism for refusing to moderate the catholic church 's anti-condom stance in the face of the aids epidemic .
but some catholics say that the church does not ban condoms outright , and is concerned with sexual morality as well as preventing hiv transmission .
an estimated 5.3 million out of south africa 's 45 million people are living with hiv - only india has more people infected with the virus .
south africa 's largest non-governmental aids prevention programme is run by the southern african catholic bishops ' conference -lrb- sacbc -rrb- .
" one can not talk about human rights without promoting reproductive rights - it 's a package , " said luyanda ngonyama , a catholic who previously worked for the sacbc hiv-aids programme , and who now co-ordinates the treatment action campaign -lrb- tac -rrb- in gauteng province .
" the pope 's teaching was limited .
one understands the constraints on him , but he was the one person who had the opportunity to make a change .
he lacked the will to make that change . "
' misunderstood ' mr ngonyama argues that the church 's approach makes it difficult to take an " integrated approach " to preventing the spread of hiv .
" if one is talking about an integrated approach , one must talk about condoms : one can say that those who want to abstain can do so , but that those who wish to use condoms because of their lifestyle must be allowed to do so . "
will the next pope take a different stand to john paul ii ?
but one sacbc aids programme staff member - who preferred to remain anonymous - said catholic teaching on condom use was often misunderstood .

campaigners say the pope 's stance on condoms cost lives during his lifetime , pope john paul ii drew criticism for refusing to moderate the catholic church 's anti-condom stance in the face of the aids epidemic .
but some catholics say that the church does not ban condoms outright , and is concerned with sexual morality as well as preventing hiv transmission .
an estimated 5.3 million out of south africa 's 45 million people are living with hiv - only india has more people infected with the virus .
south africa 's largest non-governmental aids prevention programme is run by the southern african catholic bishops ' conference -lrb- sacbc -rrb- .

" the pope 's teaching was limited .
one understands the constraints on him , but he was the one person who had the opportunity to make a change .
he lacked the will to make that change . "
' misunderstood ' mr ngonyama argues that the church 's approach makes it difficult to take an " integrated approach " to preventing the spread of hiv .
" if one is talking about an integrated approach , one must talk about condoms : one can say that those who want to abstain can do so , but that those who wish to use condoms because of their lifestyle must be allowed to do so . "

education secretary ruth kelly says the plans will attack the " drop-out culture " of unqualified youngsters leaving school at 16 .
" it will represent a dramatic change from where we are now , " she said .
the conservatives and lib dems have attacked the government 's target setting in education .
labour plans for education will include strong messages on the need to give all pupils the foundation stones of " functional " skills necessary for work and further studying .
' parents ' voice ' there will also be a strengthening of the parents ' voice within the school system , an emphasis on improving classroom discipline , more for early years services and a reminder of the government 's programme of modernising school buildings .
education interviews labour : ruth kelly wants skills for all school leavers conservatives : tim collins backs school discipline liberal democrats : phil willis says sue violent parents " there will be a huge drive to ensure that nobody leaves school without a real grasp of literacy and numeracy .
we 'll be setting out proposals as to how we want to make that happen , " the education secretary told the bbc news website .
" in primary schools we 've already made a huge difference , with 78 % of children getting up to the required standard for english .
but we 've got to do more for those who have not reached that level by the age of 11 .
" and we 've got to make sure that everyone gets up to gcse standard by the time they leave school . "
this " standards drive " to push students up to gcse level would " open up opportunities to learn and to really take part in society and to get a job .
if you have n't mastered the basics you 're really disadvantaged . "
earlier this year the government announced plans to introduce a new " functional skills " test which students would have to pass before they could get a gcse in maths and english .
as well as being part of the overall gcse , these functional literacy and numeracy tests will be certificated in their own right .
' blue collar education blueprint ' employers have long complained that young people lacked a basic level of ability in writing and numeracy - a problem which the functional tests will seek to address .
i get it from parents who are worried about their children .
they realise that too many people are dropping out of the school system at 16 or 17 .
they need skills to get on in life .

education secretary ruth kelly says the plans will attack the " drop-out culture " of unqualified youngsters leaving school at 16 .
" it will represent a dramatic change from where we are now , " she said .
the conservatives and lib dems have attacked the government 's target setting in education .
labour plans for education will include strong messages on the need to give all pupils the foundation stones of " functional " skills necessary for work and further studying .
' parents ' voice ' there will also be a strengthening of the parents ' voice within the school system , an emphasis on improving classroom discipline , more for early years services and a reminder of the government 's programme of modernising school buildings .
education interviews labour : ruth kelly wants skills for all school leavers conservatives : tim collins backs school discipline liberal democrats : phil willis says sue violent parents " there will be a huge drive to ensure that nobody leaves school without a real grasp of literacy and numeracy .
we 'll be setting out proposals as to how we want to make that happen , " the education secretary told the bbc news website .
" in primary schools we 've already made a huge difference , with 78 % of children getting up to the required standard for english .
but we 've got to do more for those who have not reached that level by the age of 11 .
" and we 've got to make sure that everyone gets up to gcse standard by the time they leave school . "
this " standards drive " to push students up to gcse level would " open up opportunities to learn and to really take part in society and to get a job .
if you have n't mastered the basics you 're really disadvantaged . "
earlier this year the government announced plans to introduce a new " functional skills " test which students would have to pass before they could get a gcse in maths and english .
as well as being part of the overall gcse , these functional literacy and numeracy tests will be certificated in their own right .
' blue collar education blueprint ' employers have long complained that young people lacked a basic level of ability in writing and numeracy - a problem which the functional tests will seek to address . "
i get it from parents who are worried about their children .
they realise that too many people are dropping out of the school system at 16 or 17 .
they need skills to get on in life . "

labour and the liberal democrats accuse the tories of wanting to cut public services .
the conservatives are stressing the need for classroom discipline as one of their key campaign pledges .
' right to choose ' but they are also offering far greater autonomy to schools and giving parents a " right to choose " over school places .
education interviews labour : ruth kelly wants skills for all school leavers conservatives : tim collins backs school discipline liberal democrats : phil willis says sue violent parents giving individual schools a share of the education publicity budget was a practical example of how centralised control could be dismantled , said mr collins .
" instead of having a vast publicity budget which is all about ministers in whitehall patting themselves on the back , the schools will have the money to provide a tabloid newspaper to every home in their area , " said mr collins .
these newspapers , produced three times a year , would allow schools to show the local community what they were achieving , including the creative work not recorded in the exam league tables , he said .
the conservatives want to end the " state monopoly " in education , allowing all schools a self-governing status , removed from local authority control , and introducing a wider range of new providers into the state system .
this could include schools set up by faith groups , private business , charities or by groups of parents .
parents choosing these schools could use public funds to pay for a place ­ as long as it was no more than the amount spent on an equivalent place in a state school .
voucher confusion although public funding will be available for places in these privately-run schools , there will not be any " voucher " given to parents , as the party 's research showed that people found a voucher system too confusing .
how can it be right that choice is only for a minority who can afford the more expensive homes in the catchment area of the good school ?
tim collins , shadow education secretary " we 're not re-creating the assisted places scheme , we 're not in the business of subsidising the super wealthy who can afford to send their children to expensive private schools , " he said .
this would be extending the type of choice already enjoyed by the wealthy , he said .
" how can it be right that choice is only for a minority who can afford the more expensive homes in the catchment area of the good school ? "
in terms of voter appeal , mr collins said that the party 's emphasis on improving classroom behaviour was proving popular on the doorsteps .
" it gets a very strong response .
there 's an instant reaction that it 's an important issue that is not being handled satisfactorily .
and they think instinctively that the conservatives would be more likely to get a grip on that than other parties , " he says .
the plans on improving discipline involve setting up a network of " turn around " schools for badly-behaved pupils and giving head teachers ' the final control over exclusions ­ and stopping appeal panels from over-ruling heads .
" it 's a pretty clear policy , popular with teachers and parents .
more to the point , it 's actually likely to work , because the absolute essential prerequisite for everything else is that you have a disciplined , controlled learning environment .
" that 's the leading edge of our education policy .
but for parents , there 's also the idea of more choice and more power .
for teachers , there 's greater professional freedom .
