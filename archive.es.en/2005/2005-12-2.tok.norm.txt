then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are finding work , according to government data germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery . in a welcome piece of news for germany 's new chancellor angela merkel , the number of people out of work in the euro zone 's biggest economy fell in november amid signs that the long-awaited economic recovery is finally gathering pace , data showed on thursday . however , analysts warned against seeing the jobless figures as a definite turnaround on the labor market , since the data were distorted by one-off factors , they argued . the german jobless total declined by 25,000 to 4.531 million in november in raw or unadjusted terms , bringing the jobless rate down to 10.9 percent from 11.0 percent , the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated .
unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

german authorities are working around the clock to secure her release .
but chancellor angela merkel said the federal government still does n't know the motives or background behind the kidnapping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel giving a public statement on the kidnapping on thursday night , osthoff 's mother and sister broadcast a plea for the kidnappers to spare osthoff 's life , reminding them that their captive is a muslim convert with a young child .
the message was shown on germany 's zdf television , and is also to be carried on al-jazeera . expats take stock the number of german citizens currently working in iraq is relatively small .
one of these is alexander christoph , who works for architects for people in need , a non-governmental organisation based in munich . " of course , we all know each other , " christoph said .
" there are n't many germans here in iraq , but we do often run into one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff 's activities won her a prize for civil courage according to christoph , the initial shock of osthoff 's abduction , seven days ago , has passed .
now he and his colleagues at other ngos have to assess how the kidnapping will affect their work . " there are always consequences , because the donors , the governments , the eu or the un only provide funding if we can prove our project will be successful , " he said .
" one of the key criteria is the safety and security of staff members , so i expect we 're going to have a hard time getting funding for next year .
that could be disastrous for our projects , which aim to help the nation rebuild . " pla n n ed political act ? according to christoph , the abduction of susanne osthoff can be interpreted as a planned political act - regardless of whether the kidnapper 's demand that germany should cut ties with the iraqi government is real , or if it is just a front for a ransom demand . " clearly , a strategy has been developed , " he said .
" the method of the kidnapping , the way the video tape was forwarded to german television so quickly ...
everything points to a well planned operation .
when it comes to kidnappings in iraq , i do n't believe in coincidences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , osthoff sent aid packages to iraq from germany while osthoff 's kidnapping may work as a deterrent to some german citizens who want to work in iraq , alexander christoph said his mind is made up .
he wo n't allow fear prevent him from continuing his work : " everyone who works in iraq knows the risks , " he said .
" everyone has to decide whether or not they 're prepared to accept them , because we all know that iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
if you really want to see things change in iraq , then foreigners have to be on the ground .
that means germans too .

we can not accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans forced from their homes after world war two kaczynski made headlines for using anti-german rhetoric during his election campaign , saying it was unacceptable " that germans are trying to portray themselves as victims of the war . " but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor . " but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration . " warsaw wants backing on eu budget poland is counting on germany to back its insistence that the eu long-term budget should not be cut at the expense of new members , prime minister marcinkiewicz said thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is gearing up for a dispute with brussels over the budget " i hope that germany will back our position and that we will adopt a common stance " on the eu budget for 2007-2013 , he said . " i hope that germany will not back the idea of developing the eu at the cost of a reduction in funds , and especially not structural funds for new members , " he told a press conference during a visit to the southern province of silesia . poland and the other nine new members of the eu are wary of a proposal by current eu president britain that newcomers to the bloc accept less in the way of development funds from brussels in order for eu spending plans for 2007-2013 to be agreed at an eu summit in two weeks ' time . particularly irksome to the new member states is the fact that the british proposal indulges france 's refusal to reform the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- and britain 's equally stubborn refusal to give up its eu budget rebate unless the cap is reformed . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .

nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .

"
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success .

" it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .

ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms .

german authorities are working around the clock to secure her release .
but chancellor angela merkel said the federal government still does n't know the motives or background behind the kidnapping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel giving a public statement on the kidnapping on thursday night , osthoff 's mother and sister broadcast a plea for the kidnappers to spare osthoff 's life , reminding them that their captive is a muslim convert with a young child .
the message was shown on germany 's zdf television , and is also to be carried on al-jazeera . expats take stock the number of german citizens currently working in iraq is relatively small .
one of these is alexander christoph , who works for architects for people in need , a non-governmental organisation based in munich . " of course , we all know each other , " christoph said .
" there are n't many germans here in iraq , but we do often run into one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff 's activities won her a prize for civil courage according to christoph , the initial shock of osthoff 's abduction , seven days ago , has passed .
now he and his colleagues at other ngos have to assess how the kidnapping will affect their work . " there are always consequences , because the donors , the governments , the eu or the un only provide funding if we can prove our project will be successful , " he said .
" one of the key criteria is the safety and security of staff members , so i expect we 're going to have a hard time getting funding for next year .
that could be disastrous for our projects , which aim to help the nation rebuild . " pla n n ed political act ? according to christoph , the abduction of susanne osthoff can be interpreted as a planned political act - regardless of whether the kidnapper 's demand that germany should cut ties with the iraqi government is real , or if it is just a front for a ransom demand . " clearly , a strategy has been developed , " he said .
" the method of the kidnapping , the way the video tape was forwarded to german television so quickly ...
everything points to a well planned operation .
when it comes to kidnappings in iraq , i do n't believe in coincidences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , osthoff sent aid packages to iraq from germany while osthoff 's kidnapping may work as a deterrent to some german citizens who want to work in iraq , alexander christoph said his mind is made up .
he wo n't allow fear prevent him from continuing his work : " everyone who works in iraq knows the risks , " he said .
" everyone has to decide whether or not they 're prepared to accept them , because we all know that iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
if you really want to see things change in iraq , then foreigners have to be on the ground .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

we can not accept it .

" but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

we can not accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans forced from their homes after world war two kaczynski made headlines for using anti-german rhetoric during his election campaign , saying it was unacceptable " that germans are trying to portray themselves as victims of the war . " but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor . " but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration . " warsaw wants backing on eu budget poland is counting on germany to back its insistence that the eu long-term budget should not be cut at the expense of new members , prime minister marcinkiewicz said thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is gearing up for a dispute with brussels over the budget " i hope that germany will back our position and that we will adopt a common stance " on the eu budget for 2007-2013 , he said . " i hope that germany will not back the idea of developing the eu at the cost of a reduction in funds , and especially not structural funds for new members , " he told a press conference during a visit to the southern province of silesia . poland and the other nine new members of the eu are wary of a proposal by current eu president britain that newcomers to the bloc accept less in the way of development funds from brussels in order for eu spending plans for 2007-2013 to be agreed at an eu summit in two weeks ' time . particularly irksome to the new member states is the fact that the british proposal indulges france 's refusal to reform the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- and britain 's equally stubborn refusal to give up its eu budget rebate unless the cap is reformed . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .

" in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .

german authorities are working around the clock to secure her release .
but chancellor angela merkel said the federal government still does n't know the motives or background behind the kidnapping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel giving a public statement on the kidnapping on thursday night , osthoff 's mother and sister broadcast a plea for the kidnappers to spare osthoff 's life , reminding them that their captive is a muslim convert with a young child .
the message was shown on germany 's zdf television , and is also to be carried on al-jazeera . expats take stock the number of german citizens currently working in iraq is relatively small .
one of these is alexander christoph , who works for architects for people in need , a non-governmental organisation based in munich . " of course , we all know each other , " christoph said .
" there are n't many germans here in iraq , but we do often run into one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff 's activities won her a prize for civil courage according to christoph , the initial shock of osthoff 's abduction , seven days ago , has passed .
now he and his colleagues at other ngos have to assess how the kidnapping will affect their work . " there are always consequences , because the donors , the governments , the eu or the un only provide funding if we can prove our project will be successful , " he said .
" one of the key criteria is the safety and security of staff members , so i expect we 're going to have a hard time getting funding for next year .
that could be disastrous for our projects , which aim to help the nation rebuild . " pla n n ed political act ? according to christoph , the abduction of susanne osthoff can be interpreted as a planned political act - regardless of whether the kidnapper 's demand that germany should cut ties with the iraqi government is real , or if it is just a front for a ransom demand . " clearly , a strategy has been developed , " he said .
" the method of the kidnapping , the way the video tape was forwarded to german television so quickly ...
everything points to a well planned operation .
when it comes to kidnappings in iraq , i do n't believe in coincidences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , osthoff sent aid packages to iraq from germany while osthoff 's kidnapping may work as a deterrent to some german citizens who want to work in iraq , alexander christoph said his mind is made up .
he wo n't allow fear prevent him from continuing his work : " everyone who works in iraq knows the risks , " he said .
" everyone has to decide whether or not they 're prepared to accept them , because we all know that iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
if you really want to see things change in iraq , then foreigners have to be on the ground .
that means germans too .

" but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor . " but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are finding work , according to government data germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery . in a welcome piece of news for germany 's new chancellor angela merkel , the number of people out of work in the euro zone 's biggest economy fell in november amid signs that the long-awaited economic recovery is finally gathering pace , data showed on thursday . however , analysts warned against seeing the jobless figures as a definite turnaround on the labor market , since the data were distorted by one-off factors , they argued . the german jobless total declined by 25,000 to 4.531 million in november in raw or unadjusted terms , bringing the jobless rate down to 10.9 percent from 11.0 percent , the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated .
unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms .

german authorities are working around the clock to secure her release .
but chancellor angela merkel said the federal government still does n't know the motives or background behind the kidnapping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel giving a public statement on the kidnapping on thursday night , osthoff 's mother and sister broadcast a plea for the kidnappers to spare osthoff 's life , reminding them that their captive is a muslim convert with a young child .
the message was shown on germany 's zdf television , and is also to be carried on al-jazeera . expats take stock the number of german citizens currently working in iraq is relatively small .
one of these is alexander christoph , who works for architects for people in need , a non-governmental organisation based in munich . " of course , we all know each other , " christoph said .
" there are n't many germans here in iraq , but we do often run into one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff 's activities won her a prize for civil courage according to christoph , the initial shock of osthoff 's abduction , seven days ago , has passed .
now he and his colleagues at other ngos have to assess how the kidnapping will affect their work . " there are always consequences , because the donors , the governments , the eu or the un only provide funding if we can prove our project will be successful , " he said .
" one of the key criteria is the safety and security of staff members , so i expect we 're going to have a hard time getting funding for next year .
that could be disastrous for our projects , which aim to help the nation rebuild . " pla n n ed political act ? according to christoph , the abduction of susanne osthoff can be interpreted as a planned political act - regardless of whether the kidnapper 's demand that germany should cut ties with the iraqi government is real , or if it is just a front for a ransom demand . " clearly , a strategy has been developed , " he said .
" the method of the kidnapping , the way the video tape was forwarded to german television so quickly ...
everything points to a well planned operation .
when it comes to kidnappings in iraq , i do n't believe in coincidences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , osthoff sent aid packages to iraq from germany while osthoff 's kidnapping may work as a deterrent to some german citizens who want to work in iraq , alexander christoph said his mind is made up .
he wo n't allow fear prevent him from continuing his work : " everyone who works in iraq knows the risks , " he said .
" everyone has to decide whether or not they 're prepared to accept them , because we all know that iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
if you really want to see things change in iraq , then foreigners have to be on the ground .
that means germans too .

the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .

" " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are finding work , according to government data germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery . in a welcome piece of news for germany 's new chancellor angela merkel , the number of people out of work in the euro zone 's biggest economy fell in november amid signs that the long-awaited economic recovery is finally gathering pace , data showed on thursday . however , analysts warned against seeing the jobless figures as a definite turnaround on the labor market , since the data were distorted by one-off factors , they argued . the german jobless total declined by 25,000 to 4.531 million in november in raw or unadjusted terms , bringing the jobless rate down to 10.9 percent from 11.0 percent , the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated .
unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .

the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .

" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data .

" but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor . " but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration .

" i hope that germany will not back the idea of developing the eu at the cost of a reduction in funds , and especially not structural funds for new members , " he told a press conference during a visit to the southern province of silesia . poland and the other nine new members of the eu are wary of a proposal by current eu president britain that newcomers to the bloc accept less in the way of development funds from brussels in order for eu spending plans for 2007-2013 to be agreed at an eu summit in two weeks ' time . particularly irksome to the new member states is the fact that the british proposal indulges france 's refusal to reform the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- and britain 's equally stubborn refusal to give up its eu budget rebate unless the cap is reformed . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

we can not accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans forced from their homes after world war two kaczynski made headlines for using anti-german rhetoric during his election campaign , saying it was unacceptable " that germans are trying to portray themselves as victims of the war . " but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor . " but for that to succeed , there must be a less intimate relationship between germany and russia and the wishes of the baltic countries must be taken into consideration . " warsaw wants backing on eu budget poland is counting on germany to back its insistence that the eu long-term budget should not be cut at the expense of new members , prime minister marcinkiewicz said thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is gearing up for a dispute with brussels over the budget " i hope that germany will back our position and that we will adopt a common stance " on the eu budget for 2007-2013 , he said . " i hope that germany will not back the idea of developing the eu at the cost of a reduction in funds , and especially not structural funds for new members , " he told a press conference during a visit to the southern province of silesia . poland and the other nine new members of the eu are wary of a proposal by current eu president britain that newcomers to the bloc accept less in the way of development funds from brussels in order for eu spending plans for 2007-2013 to be agreed at an eu summit in two weeks ' time . particularly irksome to the new member states is the fact that the british proposal indulges france 's refusal to reform the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- and britain 's equally stubborn refusal to give up its eu budget rebate unless the cap is reformed . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .

nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .

"
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success .

" it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are finding work , according to government data germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery . in a welcome piece of news for germany 's new chancellor angela merkel , the number of people out of work in the euro zone 's biggest economy fell in november amid signs that the long-awaited economic recovery is finally gathering pace , data showed on thursday . however , analysts warned against seeing the jobless figures as a definite turnaround on the labor market , since the data were distorted by one-off factors , they argued . the german jobless total declined by 25,000 to 4.531 million in november in raw or unadjusted terms , bringing the jobless rate down to 10.9 percent from 11.0 percent , the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated .
unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

we can not accept it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans forced from their homes after world war two kaczynski made headlines for using anti-german rhetoric during his election campaign , saying it was unacceptable " that germans are trying to portray themselves as victims of the war . " but since his election , kaczynski has insisted that he wants close partnership with poland 's neighbour to the west . and polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , who is settling into office at the head of a minority government following elections in september , has said he is looking forward to opening a " very good " chapter of relations with germany . wary of schröder-putin friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : best buds : putin and schröder analysts say poland is indeed likely to be receptive to the new german leader , because it viewed schröder 's close friendship with russian president vladimir putin with great suspicion . poland was furious at the signing in september of a german-russian deal to build a gas pipeline which will not pass over polish territory , depriving it of lucrative transit fees . and merkel has said that the european union must listen more closely to its newer members , such as poland . ulrike guerot , of the berlin-based german marshall fund , told afp that germany has made a concerted effort since the war to improve ties with its neighbor .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

german authorities are working around the clock to secure her release .
but chancellor angela merkel said the federal government still does n't know the motives or background behind the kidnapping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel giving a public statement on the kidnapping on thursday night , osthoff 's mother and sister broadcast a plea for the kidnappers to spare osthoff 's life , reminding them that their captive is a muslim convert with a young child .
the message was shown on germany 's zdf television , and is also to be carried on al-jazeera . expats take stock the number of german citizens currently working in iraq is relatively small .
one of these is alexander christoph , who works for architects for people in need , a non-governmental organisation based in munich . " of course , we all know each other , " christoph said .
" there are n't many germans here in iraq , but we do often run into one another . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff 's activities won her a prize for civil courage according to christoph , the initial shock of osthoff 's abduction , seven days ago , has passed .
now he and his colleagues at other ngos have to assess how the kidnapping will affect their work . " there are always consequences , because the donors , the governments , the eu or the un only provide funding if we can prove our project will be successful , " he said .
" one of the key criteria is the safety and security of staff members , so i expect we 're going to have a hard time getting funding for next year .
that could be disastrous for our projects , which aim to help the nation rebuild . " pla n n ed political act ? according to christoph , the abduction of susanne osthoff can be interpreted as a planned political act - regardless of whether the kidnapper 's demand that germany should cut ties with the iraqi government is real , or if it is just a front for a ransom demand . " clearly , a strategy has been developed , " he said .
" the method of the kidnapping , the way the video tape was forwarded to german television so quickly ...
everything points to a well planned operation .
when it comes to kidnappings in iraq , i do n't believe in coincidences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , osthoff sent aid packages to iraq from germany while osthoff 's kidnapping may work as a deterrent to some german citizens who want to work in iraq , alexander christoph said his mind is made up .
he wo n't allow fear prevent him from continuing his work : " everyone who works in iraq knows the risks , " he said .
" everyone has to decide whether or not they 're prepared to accept them , because we all know that iraq is one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
if you really want to see things change in iraq , then foreigners have to be on the ground .
that means germans too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2005 new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 15 ethnic germans were forced to flee the east after 1945 a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery . the long march from his childhood home in parchwitz , now poland , is as vivid a memory in friedrich vetter 's mind as if it happened yesterday .
then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .

then only five , vetter and his family joined an estimated 15 million ethnic germans kicked out of their ancestral homes in eastern europe following the demise of the nazi regime in 1945 .
now 56 , vetter thinks it is time germans have a place to learn about the suffering his family endured .
he has thrown his support behind a controversial plan to erect a center dealing with the mass exodus . " it 's important that you do something like that , so that it remains part of memory and does n't happen again , " said vetter . the proposal is anything but welcome by germany 's neighbors .
they see an echo of misplaced nationalism in the center against expulsions , and object to its planned location in berlin , the former capital of the third reich .
but its realization could be closer than ever since angela merkel took over the chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- left -rrb- talks to poland 's president-elect lech kaczynski in warsaw merkel in favor of " symbol " in berlin a supporter of the plight of the expellees , the coalition agreement between merkel 's conservative christian democratic union and the social democrats foresees the establishment of a " visible symbol in berlin " to show the " injustice of expulsion . " though the wording may be a bit vague , advocates say merkel , who visited poland on friday for the first time since becoming chancellor nov .
22 , is sure to take a stronger stance on the issue than any of her predecessors . " i 'm expecting far better policies and the signs point in the right direction for the next four years , " said erika steinbach , a member of german parliament and director of the german league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , in an interview .
" i think the chancellor will be able to take a lot of the emotion out of the debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach , president of the german league of expellees the poisoned atmosphere between german advocates of the center and germany 's neighbors has been its biggest hurdle .
the refusal of polish and czech governments to acknowledge crimes and human rights violations committed against the expellees are among the league 's biggest gripes .
their demands , on the other hand , have prompted accusations in poland and the czech republic that the association is ignoring the nazi conquest that prompted the postwar expulsions . bad blood on all sides " from our point of view , it seemed like they wanted to change history , and change the past , " said tadeusz cegielski , a professor at warsaw university . the argument reached a low point in 2003 , when steinbach herself was the victim of scathing depictions in the polish press , including one magazine that dressed her up in a nazi uniform in a photo montage . some , including other expellee organizations , say steinbach and her organization 's reputation in eastern europe might make it necessary for them to fade into the background of the discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial cover of the polish weekly wprost -lrb- direct -rrb- " i do n't think the solo leadership -lrb- in the discussion -rrb- should be with the bdv , " said herbert werner , director of both a german-czech organization , and a working group on expellees associated with the catholic church .
a center for europe , not just germans the discussion has taken a more positive turn since steinbach expanded the idea to include the expulsion of some 30 other ethnic groups in europe in the 20th century .
ahead of her visit on friday , merkel emphasized the european context of the planned center , and said it was n't about " making history relative . " " it could be a good idea when we try to show what has happened all over europe , and not to only speak about the german side , " said cegielski . vetter agrees , adding that forced expulsions were a regular occurrence in 20th century europe .
he says he has hope for the future .
the warm welcome he gets whenever he returns to his home town , now known as prochowize , as well as the family that bought the house where he was born , gives him hope for the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the displacement of ethnic albanians in kosovo would also be a topic for the proposed center " i have a lot of contact with polish colleagues and we already have good relationships with one another , " said vetter .
" that 's why i think merkel will be able to do the same . " in fact , before her trip to poland , merkel told the magazine fakt that a center in berlin would be part of a europe-wide " network of remembrance and solidarity , " which the previous german government under gerhard schröder had supported .
she said any project would be undertaken with poland 's agreement . " remembering understood in that way has nothing to do with a relativization of history , " she said . prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz also showed a more conciliatory attitude toward a center for expellees .
however , at the same time , he did not rule out the possibility that warsaw might make new demands for reparations from berlin for damages incurred in the second world war , which began when germany invaded poland in 1939 . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , poland split on expellee center a proposed berlin center against war-time expulsions remains a hot-button issue between germans and poles : while warsaw rejects the plan , germany 's likely next government is split on the issue .

unemployment usually declines in the autumn months . but the trend this month was " more favorable than usual at this time of year , " said labor office board member heinrich alt , who attributed the development in part to the mild weather , as well as to statistical changes . the cut-off date for the collation of the monthly jobless statistics has been shifted from the end to the middle of the month . despite reservatio n s , decrease is " impressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the numbers may be seasonally adjusted , progress is being made .
such considerations meant that the decline in the november number was " exaggerated by around a half , " alt said .
nevertheless , the drop was " impressive and continues on from the favorable trend observed in the previous fourth months , " he added . seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank showed a decline in the german jobless total of around 53,000 to 4.753 million in november .
the adjusted jobless rate slipped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said . the adjusted data , more closely watched by economists and analysts , were better than expected : consensus forecasts had suggested a more modest decline of around 20,000 in the jobless queues in november . the data came as a welcome piece of news for chancellor merkel whose aim is to substantially reduce non-wage labor costs and make it cheaper for companies to take on new employees . good n ews for recovery focused cha n cellor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has made the recovery of the economy a priority .
merkel and her so-called grand coalition of left and right officially started work last week , giving top priority to bringing the moribund german economy back to life . the conservative leader , the first-ever woman chancellor and the first government leader to come from the former communist east , has said her administration will be judged by its ability to boost growth and employment . the latest data suggest that the german economy is indeed on the verge of a cyclical upswing , with gross domestic product growth accelerating in the third quarter of this year and leading indicators also pointing up . merkel 's new economy minister michael glos hailed the decline in the november jobless figures as a " positive sign . "
and he reiterated the government 's determination to further trim the jobless queues . social democrats claim victory of reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and other social democrats are claiming an spd success .
the administration 's new labor minister franz müntefering , a member of the social democrat spd party , said the data confirmed that the government 's labor market reforms were finally paying off .
" it is the most favorable development in november since unification , " müntefering said . the social democrats ' assistant parliamentary secretary gerd andre added that the new job market figures show the first positive effects of the previous government 's reforms . " the success of the labor market policy of the red-green coalition is now being seen , " he said .
" the new government will now harvest the fruits of that success . " but the liberal opposition was skeptical ; with fdp chief rainer brüderle saying that merkel 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent would lead to higher prices and less employment . a n alysts speak of stabilizatio n n ot recovery analysts were also cautious about reading too much into the november jobless data . " it represents some degree of stabilization on the labor market , " noted commerzbank economist matthias rubisch .
" but it ca n't be seen as a recovery , since special statistical effects and so-called one-euro jobs are distorting the numbers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini- and one-euro jobs are credited with lowering unemployment .
ubs economist edward teather agreed .
" the numbers will likely have been distorted by subsidized employment schemes , such as mini-jobs and one-euro jobs , " he said . " nonetheless , we believe the decline in unemployment is consistent with a further stabilization of the underlying employment situation in germany in the fourth quarter . " fears that recovery may fall victim to ecb co n ditio n s observers are also concerned that the tentative recovery could be strangled by rising interest rates as the european central bank tightens monetary conditions in the euro area to keep inflation in check . the ecb announced a quarter-point rise in rates to 2.25 percent later on thursday , a move that is expected to hit germany harder than its euro zone partners . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

under the first snowfall of winter , by the side of the daugava river in riga , latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is inspecting her armed forces .
a military band accompanies her , stopping , sometimes mid-note , as she pauses to bow to each regimental colour-bearer .
a gunship on the river fires in salute as helicopters towing the latvian flag fly overhead .
it is latvian independence day and this annual military parade displays the pride of the country 's armed forces .
it marks the day , 87 years ago , when latvia first became a state .
but the new country was short-lived : in 1940 it was occupied by the soviet union , an occupation that lasted half a century .

at the museum of the occupation of latvia , they try to show visitors what life was like in soviet times , displaying many personal items which people smuggled back from prison camps in siberia , and kept hidden until the fall of the ussr .
the museum 's director , gundega michel , says they learn more every day , as people still bring items to the museum ; but researchers are still asking basic questions - such as how many people were deported from latvia by the soviet authorities , how many deportees died , and of the survivors , how many returned to the country .

the records of the deportations of more than 15,000 people in just one night in 1941 fill three rows of shelves - it took archivists three years to read them all .

now 76 years old , daina was just 11 in 1941 , when her father was arrested and shot .
she was deported to siberia with her mother , brother and sister - and the children were only allowed back to latvia five years later , because their mother had died in exile .
daina was told to keep quiet about what had happened to her , and did so for more than 40 years .

its results could be used to claim reparations from the soviet union 's legal heir - russia .

juris sokolovskis , an ethnic russian mp , says the commission has been set up simply to win votes for latvian nationalist parties .

he says the commission is needed so that latvia can face up to its history .
in any case , he says , his job is just to make calculations and give his results to the government , who will then decide what to do with them .
when those results are finally produced , how they are used will affect whether latvia is indeed able to come to terms with its past - or whether its painful history continues to divide this newly reborn nation .

under the first snowfall of winter , by the side of the daugava river in riga , latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is inspecting her armed forces .
a military band accompanies her , stopping , sometimes mid-note , as she pauses to bow to each regimental colour-bearer .
a gunship on the river fires in salute as helicopters towing the latvian flag fly overhead .
it is latvian independence day and this annual military parade displays the pride of the country 's armed forces .
it marks the day , 87 years ago , when latvia first became a state .
but the new country was short-lived : in 1940 it was occupied by the soviet union , an occupation that lasted half a century .
it is 14 years since latvia became a nation again , and the county is proud of how much it has changed since then .
unread files last year , the country joined nato and the european union , and it is looking enthusiastically to the future .
but its relationship with the past is more troubled - there are still many unanswered questions about what happened here under soviet rule .
we were a family , and suddenly there was no family and no tomorrow daina girke now , however , the government has set up a commission to calculate the cost of the soviet occupation , in both human and financial terms .
it will not be easy .
at the museum of the occupation of latvia , they try to show visitors what life was like in soviet times , displaying many personal items which people smuggled back from prison camps in siberia , and kept hidden until the fall of the ussr .
the museum 's director , gundega michel , says they learn more every day , as people still bring items to the museum ; but researchers are still asking basic questions - such as how many people were deported from latvia by the soviet authorities , how many deportees died , and of the survivors , how many returned to the country .
" there are still tens of thousands of people unaccounted for , " she says .
the records held in latvia 's state archives will be key to finding many of the answers .
one storeroom full of cardboard box files contains kgb dossiers recording the fates of hundreds of thousands of people , deported or arrested by the soviet authorities .
children deported most of the documents have not been read - and the task of going through them is painfully slow .
the records of the deportations of more than 15,000 people in just one night in 1941 fill three rows of shelves - it took archivists three years to read them all .
daina was sent to a village in siberia where she lived in exile one of those folders contains daina girke 's story .
now 76 years old , daina was just 11 in 1941 , when her father was arrested and shot .
she was deported to siberia with her mother , brother and sister - and the children were only allowed back to latvia five years later , because their mother had died in exile .
daina was told to keep quiet about what had happened to her , and did so for more than 40 years .
now , she says , latvians have a duty to talk about what happened .
" it was terrible .
terrible , " she says .
" we were a family , and suddenly there was no family and no tomorrow .
when they took us from our house i was in hysterics , crying .
i was so afraid that i 'd never see my home again . "
important work the commission 's task - to put a price on such experiences - is a controversial one .
its results could be used to claim reparations from the soviet union 's legal heir - russia .
personal items from the prison camps are on display at the museum and with nearly 30 % of latvia 's population made up of ethnic russians , and a general election due next year , some accuse the government of playing politics with history .
juris sokolovskis , an ethnic russian mp , says the commission has been set up simply to win votes for latvian nationalist parties .
but edmunds stankevics - the head of the commission - rejects the accusation .
he says the commission is needed so that latvia can face up to its history .
in any case , he says , his job is just to make calculations and give his results to the government , who will then decide what to do with them .
when those results are finally produced , how they are used will affect whether latvia is indeed able to come to terms with its past - or whether its painful history continues to divide this newly reborn nation .

the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union will announce the results of a ballot of 1,800 maintenance staff at tube infrastructure company metronet .
rail disruption is also expected in south england because of maintenance work at london waterloo at christmas .
south west trains services from surrey , hampshire and the west country are likely to be affected .
the tube row is over jobs and pensions for maintenance staff , but it could mean 1,500 drivers work to rule because the lines will not be properly maintained during the strike .
we are not in dispute with the travelling public bob crow there is a possibility of a series of one-day strikes in the run-up to christmas .
the rmt 's dispute is with metronet 's plans to allow its subcontractor bombardier to maintain new victoria and circle line trains , which the union said will " further fragment " the tube infrastructure .
metronet said plans to use bombardier to supply and maintain new trains have been known about for a long time .
it accused the rmt of " an unflattering record of calling for industrial action in the month of december " - seven times since 1996 .
but the rmt also said london underground has not assured them proper track inspections will be carried out during a strike .
' deep regret ' so drivers are being balloted on taking action " short of a strike " - which could mean refusing to work on safety grounds or driving very slowly which would disrupt services on 10 lines .
rmt leader bob crow told bbc london metronet was not taking their concerns seriously .

the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union will announce the results of a ballot of 1,800 maintenance staff at tube infrastructure company metronet .
rail disruption is also expected in south england because of maintenance work at london waterloo at christmas .
south west trains services from surrey , hampshire and the west country are likely to be affected .
the tube row is over jobs and pensions for maintenance staff , but it could mean 1,500 drivers work to rule because the lines will not be properly maintained during the strike .
we are not in dispute with the travelling public bob crow there is a possibility of a series of one-day strikes in the run-up to christmas .
the rmt 's dispute is with metronet 's plans to allow its subcontractor bombardier to maintain new victoria and circle line trains , which the union said will " further fragment " the tube infrastructure .
metronet said plans to use bombardier to supply and maintain new trains have been known about for a long time .
it accused the rmt of " an unflattering record of calling for industrial action in the month of december " - seven times since 1996 .
but the rmt also said london underground has not assured them proper track inspections will be carried out during a strike .
' deep regret ' so drivers are being balloted on taking action " short of a strike " - which could mean refusing to work on safety grounds or driving very slowly which would disrupt services on 10 lines .
rmt leader bob crow told bbc london metronet was not taking their concerns seriously .
" we are not in dispute with the travelling public and it is with deep regret that there would be any action , " he said .
" but we are an organisation that represents railway workers and tube workers - that 's our job that we have to do . "

former deputy justice minister richard simpson said spending was " skewed " towards long-term addicts and should be targeted at those in the early stages .
he spoke out after ministers admitted they did not know how many people were receiving heroin substitute methadone .
the executive said it was exploring all forms of treatment .
a spokesman said prescription statistics did not give the precise information on the numbers taking methadone , although the figure was estimated at 19,200 last year . "
we should be spending more funds and more attention on those at the other end of the spectrum who have recently become dependent " richard simpson statistics for the number of people who have come off methadone to become completely drug-free were also unavailable .
david liddell , director of the scottish drugs forum , said there needed to be a range of measures in place to help move people off methadone .
he suggested education and training programmes to give addicts hope that there was life beyond drug dependency .
dr simpson , who resigned as a deputy minister in 2002 , said the executive was concentrating too much effort on the criminal justice element of drug abuse .
he said drug courts were the most expensive measure , although it was not yet known if they were successful .
difficult addicts " then there are drug treatment and testing orders , and below that there are a number of other orders which are all on the criminal end of things , " he said .
" they are highly intensive , very costly , and they impinge on the most difficult addicts .
" we should be spending more funds and more attention on those at the other end of the spectrum who have recently become dependent , those who have children , for example , but are not involved in substantial criminal activity . "
the most effective treatment will always depend on the circumstances of the individual addict " scottish executive spokesman " i think we have got our expenditure somewhat skewed . "
the executive said it was expanding all types of treatment , not just methadone .
" services must work together to address the often complex factors which can underpin addictions , " said a spokesman .
" methadone is not a solution to drug addiction .
but as part of a programme it allows people to stabilise their lives enough to think about the next stage in the journey away from drugs , and towards a much more positive life .
