a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .
" it 's unbelievable that he does n't listen a little .
the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .

actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark .

unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .

eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .

unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .

but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

" it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .
" it 's unbelievable that he does n't listen a little .
the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .
meny said they fail to live up to their " enormous responsibility " by not sufficiently talking the truth . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de approval of eu constitution may take time joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .

eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark .

" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .

she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

" it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .

" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .

the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark .

unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .
" it 's unbelievable that he does n't listen a little .
the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .
meny said they fail to live up to their " enormous responsibility " by not sufficiently talking the truth . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de approval of eu constitution may take time joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .

unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

meanwhile , the chinese people desire more for the money they earn : electronics , nicer apartments and cars .
china 's domestic automakers are turning to europe for assistance , even buying manufacturers if necessary .
here , dw-world presents a selection of stories that relate to the current state of economic and political relations between germany and the world 's most populous country , china . dw-world.de china weapons embargo full of holes the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .
at least , that 's what many power-brokers hope . his nickname in his home country suggests a standing in the public eye to rate with germany 's emperor 's of the past .
his life in soccer has spanned the roles of player , coach and statesman . his achievements have brought him the most prestigious accolades available in the game , both domestically and internationally and he is credited with bringing the disparate forces of german soccer together into a highly respected sporting organization .
he is franz beckenbauer , " der kaiser " , the man who germany has put forward as its candidate for the presidency of uefa , european soccer 's governing body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first glance he appears to have it all and then some .
national , european and world championship trophies with club and country ; personal awards such as the european footballer of the year and more recently financial awards in the form of lucrative advertising deals and endorsements . beckenbauer also has a foundation named after him and is one of the most sought-after and respected commentator 's in sport .
add the five kids and two ex-wives and kaiser franz could well be considered a modern aristocrat with his own empire and legacy . plotting ascention to the summit of the game it seems that the only thing missing from this life is the elevation to the top of soccer 's organizational structure .
while the fifa presidency , the world soccer body under the command of sepp blatter , seems to be in relatively safe hands - for now , the european equivalent will soon be up-for-grabs . and beckenbauer is more than a little keen to get his candidacy out in the open in a bid to fend off rivals such as former france captain michel platini .
it would be a brave person who would discount the kaiser 's chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer with another living legend , pele .
“ he ’ s one of the lucky men of world sport , ” walter straten of the german tabloid bild told dw-radio . but straten , who helped break the story , is convinced that luck would not come into it if beckenbauer was elected .
beckenbauer would be the ideal candidate to shake up european soccer from top to bottom .
“ franz beckenbauer is not a man of bureaucracy . he ’ s played football on the highest possible level .
if he makes changes , he ’ ll do it only in the meaning of the sport , not in the meaning of economics . ” match-fixing may be a double-edged sword match-fixing scandals have put european soccer in the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the effects have shaken the faith of all those involved .
fans no longer know if players and referees are honest .
beckenbauer , beloved around europe and respected around the world , could restore the trust the game needs , to keep fans in the stadiums and advertisers signing contracts . but it could be that very scandal that scuppers beckenbauer 's campaign .
the biggest match-fixing scandal of recent times is happening right now in his homeland and no-one would be blind enough to ignore the fact that national interests taint the uefa president candidate selection process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ of course !
the german federation has an interest to be the head of european football .
why should they deny it ? ”
straten stated incredulously .
with a damaged reputation , germany could start to rebuild faith around the globe by installing a man whose own discretions have failed to taint him or stick to his increasingly public persona as if he is made of teflon .
beckenbauer would be sold as the true face of german soccer ; a fair winner , a champion of the fair spirit of the game . france places hopes in hands of platini germany is not the only country looking to plant a personality in the european hot-seat for its own gains .
france 's candidate michel platini , the former captain of the french national team and a european championship winner , would do much to elevate french soccer 's rapidly falling star .
after sweeping all before them , the french national side has imploded , losing both the world and european crowns in successive tournament failures .
the domestic scene has also suffered as france 's league clubs have slid back into the shadows of mediocrity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa executive committee member michel platini draws turkish team fenerbache in the group d for the uefa soccer champions league , in monaco , thursday aug .
26 , 2004 .
the first matches are set for sept .
14-15 and the final will be played may 25 , 2005 in istanbul , turkey .
-lrb- ap photo / bruno bebert -rrb- platini ’ s own star twinkles only slightly less than beckenbauer ’ s .
in an internet poll to determine europe ’ s greatest football player ever , platini came in ninth .
beckenbauer came in second .
who would lead uefa better ? “ i think there ’ s not much difference between platini and beckenbauer ” , straten mused . you scratch my back .. ? so it may come down to a battle of nations , to see who will sit in uefa ’ s headquarters in switzerland .
the outgoing president , swede lennart johansson , received the federal cross of merit in berlin just recently .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .
" it 's the money .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .
" it 's unbelievable that he does n't listen a little .
the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .
meny said they fail to live up to their " enormous responsibility " by not sufficiently talking the truth . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de approval of eu constitution may take time joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .

germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .
at least , that 's what many power-brokers hope . his nickname in his home country suggests a standing in the public eye to rate with germany 's emperor 's of the past .
his life in soccer has spanned the roles of player , coach and statesman . his achievements have brought him the most prestigious accolades available in the game , both domestically and internationally and he is credited with bringing the disparate forces of german soccer together into a highly respected sporting organization .
he is franz beckenbauer , " der kaiser " , the man who germany has put forward as its candidate for the presidency of uefa , european soccer 's governing body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first glance he appears to have it all and then some .
national , european and world championship trophies with club and country ; personal awards such as the european footballer of the year and more recently financial awards in the form of lucrative advertising deals and endorsements . beckenbauer also has a foundation named after him and is one of the most sought-after and respected commentator 's in sport .
add the five kids and two ex-wives and kaiser franz could well be considered a modern aristocrat with his own empire and legacy . plotting ascention to the summit of the game it seems that the only thing missing from this life is the elevation to the top of soccer 's organizational structure .
while the fifa presidency , the world soccer body under the command of sepp blatter , seems to be in relatively safe hands - for now , the european equivalent will soon be up-for-grabs . and beckenbauer is more than a little keen to get his candidacy out in the open in a bid to fend off rivals such as former france captain michel platini .
it would be a brave person who would discount the kaiser 's chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer with another living legend , pele .
“ he ’ s one of the lucky men of world sport , ” walter straten of the german tabloid bild told dw-radio . but straten , who helped break the story , is convinced that luck would not come into it if beckenbauer was elected .
beckenbauer would be the ideal candidate to shake up european soccer from top to bottom .
“ franz beckenbauer is not a man of bureaucracy . he ’ s played football on the highest possible level .
if he makes changes , he ’ ll do it only in the meaning of the sport , not in the meaning of economics . ” match-fixing may be a double-edged sword match-fixing scandals have put european soccer in the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the effects have shaken the faith of all those involved .
fans no longer know if players and referees are honest .
beckenbauer , beloved around europe and respected around the world , could restore the trust the game needs , to keep fans in the stadiums and advertisers signing contracts . but it could be that very scandal that scuppers beckenbauer 's campaign .
the biggest match-fixing scandal of recent times is happening right now in his homeland and no-one would be blind enough to ignore the fact that national interests taint the uefa president candidate selection process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ of course !
the german federation has an interest to be the head of european football .
why should they deny it ? ”
straten stated incredulously .
with a damaged reputation , germany could start to rebuild faith around the globe by installing a man whose own discretions have failed to taint him or stick to his increasingly public persona as if he is made of teflon .
beckenbauer would be sold as the true face of german soccer ; a fair winner , a champion of the fair spirit of the game . france places hopes in hands of platini germany is not the only country looking to plant a personality in the european hot-seat for its own gains .
france 's candidate michel platini , the former captain of the french national team and a european championship winner , would do much to elevate french soccer 's rapidly falling star .
after sweeping all before them , the french national side has imploded , losing both the world and european crowns in successive tournament failures .
the domestic scene has also suffered as france 's league clubs have slid back into the shadows of mediocrity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa executive committee member michel platini draws turkish team fenerbache in the group d for the uefa soccer champions league , in monaco , thursday aug .
26 , 2004 .
the first matches are set for sept .
14-15 and the final will be played may 25 , 2005 in istanbul , turkey .
-lrb- ap photo / bruno bebert -rrb- platini ’ s own star twinkles only slightly less than beckenbauer ’ s .
in an internet poll to determine europe ’ s greatest football player ever , platini came in ninth .
beckenbauer came in second .
who would lead uefa better ? “ i think there ’ s not much difference between platini and beckenbauer ” , straten mused . you scratch my back .. ? so it may come down to a battle of nations , to see who will sit in uefa ’ s headquarters in switzerland .
the outgoing president , swede lennart johansson , received the federal cross of merit in berlin just recently .
german interior minister otto schily called him a great friend of germany .
just how much of a good friend will be seen in the months leading up to the naming of his successor . dw staff -lrb- nda / erik campano -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .
at least , that 's what many power-brokers hope . his nickname in his home country suggests a standing in the public eye to rate with germany 's emperor 's of the past .
his life in soccer has spanned the roles of player , coach and statesman . his achievements have brought him the most prestigious accolades available in the game , both domestically and internationally and he is credited with bringing the disparate forces of german soccer together into a highly respected sporting organization .
he is franz beckenbauer , " der kaiser " , the man who germany has put forward as its candidate for the presidency of uefa , european soccer 's governing body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first glance he appears to have it all and then some .
national , european and world championship trophies with club and country ; personal awards such as the european footballer of the year and more recently financial awards in the form of lucrative advertising deals and endorsements . beckenbauer also has a foundation named after him and is one of the most sought-after and respected commentator 's in sport .
add the five kids and two ex-wives and kaiser franz could well be considered a modern aristocrat with his own empire and legacy . plotting ascention to the summit of the game it seems that the only thing missing from this life is the elevation to the top of soccer 's organizational structure .
while the fifa presidency , the world soccer body under the command of sepp blatter , seems to be in relatively safe hands - for now , the european equivalent will soon be up-for-grabs . and beckenbauer is more than a little keen to get his candidacy out in the open in a bid to fend off rivals such as former france captain michel platini .
it would be a brave person who would discount the kaiser 's chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer with another living legend , pele .
“ he ’ s one of the lucky men of world sport , ” walter straten of the german tabloid bild told dw-radio . but straten , who helped break the story , is convinced that luck would not come into it if beckenbauer was elected .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .
at least , that 's what many power-brokers hope . his nickname in his home country suggests a standing in the public eye to rate with germany 's emperor 's of the past .
his life in soccer has spanned the roles of player , coach and statesman . his achievements have brought him the most prestigious accolades available in the game , both domestically and internationally and he is credited with bringing the disparate forces of german soccer together into a highly respected sporting organization .
he is franz beckenbauer , " der kaiser " , the man who germany has put forward as its candidate for the presidency of uefa , european soccer 's governing body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first glance he appears to have it all and then some .
national , european and world championship trophies with club and country ; personal awards such as the european footballer of the year and more recently financial awards in the form of lucrative advertising deals and endorsements . beckenbauer also has a foundation named after him and is one of the most sought-after and respected commentator 's in sport .
add the five kids and two ex-wives and kaiser franz could well be considered a modern aristocrat with his own empire and legacy . plotting ascention to the summit of the game it seems that the only thing missing from this life is the elevation to the top of soccer 's organizational structure .
while the fifa presidency , the world soccer body under the command of sepp blatter , seems to be in relatively safe hands - for now , the european equivalent will soon be up-for-grabs . and beckenbauer is more than a little keen to get his candidacy out in the open in a bid to fend off rivals such as former france captain michel platini .
it would be a brave person who would discount the kaiser 's chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer with another living legend , pele .
“ he ’ s one of the lucky men of world sport , ” walter straten of the german tabloid bild told dw-radio . but straten , who helped break the story , is convinced that luck would not come into it if beckenbauer was elected .
beckenbauer would be the ideal candidate to shake up european soccer from top to bottom .
“ franz beckenbauer is not a man of bureaucracy . he ’ s played football on the highest possible level .
if he makes changes , he ’ ll do it only in the meaning of the sport , not in the meaning of economics . ” match-fixing may be a double-edged sword match-fixing scandals have put european soccer in the headlines for all the wrong reasons .
the effects have shaken the faith of all those involved .
fans no longer know if players and referees are honest .
beckenbauer , beloved around europe and respected around the world , could restore the trust the game needs , to keep fans in the stadiums and advertisers signing contracts . but it could be that very scandal that scuppers beckenbauer 's campaign .
the biggest match-fixing scandal of recent times is happening right now in his homeland and no-one would be blind enough to ignore the fact that national interests taint the uefa president candidate selection process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ of course !
the german federation has an interest to be the head of european football .
why should they deny it ? ”
straten stated incredulously .
with a damaged reputation , germany could start to rebuild faith around the globe by installing a man whose own discretions have failed to taint him or stick to his increasingly public persona as if he is made of teflon .
beckenbauer would be sold as the true face of german soccer ; a fair winner , a champion of the fair spirit of the game . france places hopes in hands of platini germany is not the only country looking to plant a personality in the european hot-seat for its own gains .
france 's candidate michel platini , the former captain of the french national team and a european championship winner , would do much to elevate french soccer 's rapidly falling star .
after sweeping all before them , the french national side has imploded , losing both the world and european crowns in successive tournament failures .
the domestic scene has also suffered as france 's league clubs have slid back into the shadows of mediocrity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa executive committee member michel platini draws turkish team fenerbache in the group d for the uefa soccer champions league , in monaco , thursday aug .
26 , 2004 .
the first matches are set for sept .
14-15 and the final will be played may 25 , 2005 in istanbul , turkey .
-lrb- ap photo / bruno bebert -rrb- platini ’ s own star twinkles only slightly less than beckenbauer ’ s .
in an internet poll to determine europe ’ s greatest football player ever , platini came in ninth .
beckenbauer came in second .
who would lead uefa better ? “ i think there ’ s not much difference between platini and beckenbauer ” , straten mused . you scratch my back .. ? so it may come down to a battle of nations , to see who will sit in uefa ’ s headquarters in switzerland .
the outgoing president , swede lennart johansson , received the federal cross of merit in berlin just recently .
german interior minister otto schily called him a great friend of germany .

a rejection by the french could kill the treaty . experts expressed fears on saturday that growing french negativism may doom the proposed constitution for the european union , but they also blamed the ineptness of politicians in brussels and paris for a crisis that may seriously set back the eu . they were commenting on the results of a poll published in france on friday that indicated by 51 percent of french voters may reject the constitution in a referendum on may 29 .
forty-nine percent said they backed the text . " if france votes no , the constitution is dead and this poll is not good , " said daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london .
" the momentum is on the no side .
it 's going to be difficult to regain and it 's worrying . " the constitution , which was adopted by eu heads of state and government in june , was intended to streamline the eu 's administration to accommodate its expanding membership , define a charter of fundamental rights for citizens and create a president and foreign minister for europe , among other things .
the constitution would replace the existing rome and maastricht treaties on which the eu is founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spains prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero speaks at the opening of the european constitution campaign in madrid in february .
since it is itself a treaty , it can not come into force until it has been ratified in every member country , either through a popular referendum as in france , or a popular vote .
spain became the first country to approve the constitution by referendum last month . past shows french power decides experts concurred that a negative vote by france , one of the six original founders of the european integration project in 1957 , would be a disastrous setback for the eu . " if you want to be positive , you could say that this poll is going to be an electro-shock . " said marielle de sarnez , a member of the european parliament and a fervent supporter of the constitution .
" but the risk is large : if france , a founding country , says no to the constitution , it will be as if it were saying no to europe . " she added that the consequences could be as serious as france 's rejection in 1954 of a proposed european defense community , which set defense cooperation back by quarter of a century .
then in 1992 french voters only narrowly approved the maastricht treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i do n't want to be a pessimist , but i think we 've started very badly , " said yves meny , president of the european university institute in florence .
" we are on a very slippery slope that will be extraordinarily difficult to climb again . " meny said he was not sure the french would be susceptible to the argument that by voting no , they would be dooming the eu to a profound crisis . politicians accused of stoking crisis analysts were scathing in their criticism of both eu and french politicians for stoking the crisis .
the former , for example , chose this moment to plug an unpopular directive , devised by former commissioner frits bolkestein , that aims to open up to competition in national public service sectors such as health and education .
french public workers went on strike earlier this month against what they see as a threat to the country 's vaunted public service tradition . yet european commission president jose durao barroso monday criticized france and other countries that are resisting the directive because of fears it will lead to " social dumping " as a result of competition from low-wage countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso faces a crisis if the french vote no .
" barroso has n't proved that he is up to the job , " said de sarnez .
" it 's unbelievable that he does n't listen a little .
the commission should also take the concerns of public opinion into account . " meny accused the commission of " waving a red flag " by supporting what is known as the country of origin principle , which means that a company can trade anywhere in the eu provided only that it obey the rules and regulations of its own country . confusion over bolkestein and constitution unions have said this will put french social services in direct competition with those in the east with lower labor costs and standards .
but analysts critized french politicians for allowing a confusion to develop in the public mind between the constitution and the so-called bolkestein directive .
even president jacques chirac does not always make the distinction , said marco incerti of the center for european policy studies . de sarnez said french citizens were wary of europe because their politicians so often present it as a scapegoat .
meny said they fail to live up to their " enormous responsibility " by not sufficiently talking the truth . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de approval of eu constitution may take time joschka fischer has called on lawmakers to quickly ratify the european union constitution , in order to set an example for other eu countries .

dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

" it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure .

germany has endorsed franz beckenbauer as its candidate for the soon-to-be vacant presidency of uefa .
a successful campaign could do much to heal german soccer .
at least , that 's what many power-brokers hope . his nickname in his home country suggests a standing in the public eye to rate with germany 's emperor 's of the past .
his life in soccer has spanned the roles of player , coach and statesman . his achievements have brought him the most prestigious accolades available in the game , both domestically and internationally and he is credited with bringing the disparate forces of german soccer together into a highly respected sporting organization .
he is franz beckenbauer , " der kaiser " , the man who germany has put forward as its candidate for the presidency of uefa , european soccer 's governing body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first glance he appears to have it all and then some .
national , european and world championship trophies with club and country ; personal awards such as the european footballer of the year and more recently financial awards in the form of lucrative advertising deals and endorsements . beckenbauer also has a foundation named after him and is one of the most sought-after and respected commentator 's in sport .
add the five kids and two ex-wives and kaiser franz could well be considered a modern aristocrat with his own empire and legacy . plotting ascention to the summit of the game it seems that the only thing missing from this life is the elevation to the top of soccer 's organizational structure .
while the fifa presidency , the world soccer body under the command of sepp blatter , seems to be in relatively safe hands - for now , the european equivalent will soon be up-for-grabs . and beckenbauer is more than a little keen to get his candidacy out in the open in a bid to fend off rivals such as former france captain michel platini .
it would be a brave person who would discount the kaiser 's chances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer with another living legend , pele .
“ he ’ s one of the lucky men of world sport , ” walter straten of the german tabloid bild told dw-radio . but straten , who helped break the story , is convinced that luck would not come into it if beckenbauer was elected .

“ franz beckenbauer is not a man of bureaucracy . he ’ s played football on the highest possible level .

fans no longer know if players and referees are honest .
beckenbauer , beloved around europe and respected around the world , could restore the trust the game needs , to keep fans in the stadiums and advertisers signing contracts . but it could be that very scandal that scuppers beckenbauer 's campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .
one of the boys stands in the footwell while the other clings on to his father from the back .
ianni is cautious in his speech when his wife in present , but when alone , he admits he had some reservations about their decision eight years ago . " if she had been 50 , i would have agreed with my wife getting pregnant , " he said .
" but 60 , i did n't really agree with .
but because we had gotten that far , we had to carry on and that 's why we had the kids at 60 . " he said he would like to see an age limit imposed on women having in vitro fertilization treatments . the greek government agrees .
it has passed a low which makes it illegal for doctors to provide in vitro services to women over 50 . " it 's very tiring having kids at 60 but the thing is that women do n't realize that at the time , " he said .
" an older woman does n't have the strength that a 30 or 40 or 50-year-old woman has . " still , despite the family ' difficulties , his wife does n't think age should be an issue . " they wo n't have any problems as long as they have money and they can get help , " she said .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .

advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .
but that 's not without consequences , as the case of greece 's oldest mother shows .
she gave birth at 60 . on the greek island of rhodes , eight-year-old angelos kariotis gets help after dinner from his mother with his homework .
it 's not an unusual scene - although in this case , an outside observer would be surprised at the picture in front of him .
angelos ' mother , charistoula , is 60 years older than her son .
her mouth is full of gold teeth , and she has the gain and demeanor of a grandmother . " she had always wanted to have kids and so had i , " said charistoula 's husband , ianni , also 68 .
he agreed to his wife 's plan to have children at her advanced age .
eight years ago , she lied to doctors about her age , even dyeing her hair black , in order to obtain in vitro fertilization treatments and get pregnant .
the result was the twins , angelos and nicolas . the family lives in the small village of arc angel , a traditional greek community where in the past a woman 's role in life was to have children and bring them up .
those who could not were often ostracized by other villagers , as charistoula was .
if a couple failed to have children , the marriage often failed as well . ianni and charistoula 's marriage survived those childless years , but they left their mark . " my wife said to me , ' ianni , we have to have children for the sake of stubbornness because of the way the people in the village have treated me , " ' ianni said . scraping by bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family lives in a small , whitewashed house with three rooms , where the twins share a bedroom with their parents .
there is no central heating , and in the winter , when rhodes can get very cold , the family huddles around a single electric heater while watching television , all dressed in their winter coats . the family gets by , just barely , on ianni 's monthly pension of 500 euros -lrb- $ 665 -rrb- .
unlike younger parents , they do not receive government child support because they are pensioners .
while most dinner tables in greece are generally overflowing with food , in the kariotis household , there are just four bowls of plain spaghetti covered with a sprinkling of cheese . " certainly , we are finding it tough in terms of money , " ianni said .
" i do n't want charity , but i would like a grant or allowance from the government to help us cope . " the family has a small farm where they grow citrus fruits and olives , but they do n't have a truck they could use to take the produce to market .
because they are retired , they do n't qualify for a government tax break to buy a cheap vehicle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the economic hardships , charistoula refused to say that she has done anything wrong by having children at her age .
she denied that she waited until the last minute to have the kids , since she had tried to get pregnant for over 18 years before she succeeded . " i had been to every doctor and medical professor you could think of in that time , " she said .
" i had the children so they could take over my property .
why should outsiders take it over ? " second thoughts every day , ianni takes the boys to school on his scooter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2005 germany moves to protect stalking victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalking victims have had little recourse in germany up to now germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has passed a bill that would provide better protection for victims of stalking .
journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .
januar 2004 , in frankfurt am main fragen von journalisten .
nach medienberichten soll es angeblich neue unregelmaessigkeiten bei der vergabe von millionenauftraegen gegeben haben .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- the group said a future law must provide protection from psychological terror , but adds that journalists are not stalkers , and what in the media would be considered " intensive investigation " could be interpreted as stalking , and land the journalist involved in jail . the association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- echoed those concerns , saying that a clause should be inserted into the legislation that ensures that reporters on the job would not be classified as stalkers . overdue the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- welcomed the move of the bundesrat , saying increased penalties for stalking are long overdue . " it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

journalists , however , fear it could turn them into criminals in the eyes of the law . according to one survey , 12 percent of germans have been the victim of a stalker , harassed by someone with letters , phone calls or sms text messages , or kept a virtual prisoner in their homes as the stalker lurks across the street , or follows them whenever they step outside . there have been some highly publicized cases , such as that of supermodel claudia schiffer or former tennis star steffi graf .
but most stalking cases concern everyday individuals , stalked in nine out of 10 cases by someone they know .
it 's a form of psychological terror which can quickly turn victims ' lives into a living hell . now germany 's bundesrat wants to increase penalties for stalking and widen the definition of what constitutes the crime .
until now , police could not legally interfere often until it was too late , and some kind of assault had taken place .
the new bill passed by the upper chamber calls for stalking to be punishable by law if the harassment has " seriously encroached upon the victim 's lifestyle . " " all too often , the victims are forced to completely change the circumstances in which they live in order to escape from their tormentors , " said christean wagner , justice minister in the state of hesse .
he added the problem of stalking can become especially serious when romantic partnerships end , and according to him , about half of all cases can be traced back to a relationship gone sour . prison time the bill says those who " strongly harass " another person should serve one to three years in jail or be forced to pay a fine .
in more serious cases , where the life of the victim is threatened or he or she is seriously injured , longer prison terms up to ten years could be imposed . the bill must first pass the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , before becoming law .
the proposed legislation is not expected to go to the lower house for several months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists who have studied stalking say it often begins with low-level harassment , such as calling often or sending text messages .
but the stalking can then escalate , with the perpetrator physically observing and following the victim . " it can also lead to physical violence , rape and even murder , " psychologist jens hoffmann of dresden 's technical university told the sächsische zeitung newspaper . he pointed to a recent case in the city of bremen where a woman was killed by her stalker , the husband from whom she was separated . bad for journalists ? criticism has come from journalists ' groups , who fear that if the bill becomes law , they could be made into criminals just for doing their jobs .
according to the federal association of german newspaper publishes -lrb- bdvz -rrb- , the bill could endanger the rights of journalists , who , for example , are involved in an investigation about a person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der chef der bundesagentur fuer arbeit florian gerster beantwortet am dienstag , 20 .

" it is incomprehensible that up to now , a shoplifter was punished more severely than a stalker was , who often drove his victims to the point of madness , " anke bernhard , the federal women 's commissioner for the dpolg , told afp news agency . the justice minister of bavaria , beate merk , also threw her support behind the measure . " stalking is not a peccadillo of a love-sick admirer , but a serious crime , " she said . in the us , canada , australia and belgium , this form of psychological terror is already classified as a punishable act . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one-click justice comes to germany a new internet system being introduced in germany will allow members of the public to make complaints to the police about illegal incidents from the comfort of their own homes .

but now there is a potential cure for the daydreaming disease . some kids , and adults for that matter , are simply born with their minds stuck into forgetful mode , and no amount of brain-training will shift the jam .
respectably bedraggled they arrive at school , hoping in vain that they have n't left their pencil case and homework on their desk . but they have .
again .
they sit and stare out of the window wondering how they could have forgotten to remember the promise to themselves to shed their old skin and become the epitome of organization , swimming in pedagogical praise as their peers look on in open-mouthed silence .
dream on … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did they bring their lunchbox ?
actually there is a much more realistic solution on the horizon .
three german whiz kids have come down from the clouds for long enough to invent a smart school bag , which does all the hard-core remembering for them . " you practically do n't have to think any more , " one of the young inventors said . no more excuses based on transponder technology , the items which traditionally belong in the old school bag , are kitted out with smart labels .
the size of credit cards , these chips respond to an antenna inside the bag , which registers " missing " on its display pad if a math book , lunch box or sport kit has been inadvertently forgotten . and it does n't only hold the promise of a virtual memory revolution for kids . " transponders are gaining popularity , " said one of the 16-year-old smarty pants .
" our system could be expanded for use in doctors ' bags or briefcases . " the new model of school bag is running in a young inventors ' competition .
but whether it wins or not will have something to do with its popularity among potential users . " actually , i think it ’ s a bit stupid , " one potential customer said .

leader michael howard has promised a moratorium on closures if the conservatives win the next election .
maria hutchings , from essex , whose son has special needs , said tory councils should adopt that policy immediately .
but the tories said councils had little discretion in applying official guidelines that promote children 's " inclusion " in mainstream schools .
mrs hutchings , from benfleet , first came to public attention when she challenged prime minister tony blair during a live tv debate last month .
she then appeared at a conservative party news conference alongside mr howard and shadow education secretary tim collins , publicising their party 's policy .
but she denied being a " political pawn " in backing their proposed ending of school closures .
upon election of a new conservative government the law will be changed to allow parents of special needs children to choose the most appropriate education for their sons and daughters conservative party she said her main concern was that the official presumption that children should attend a mainstream school meant provision was being polarised between schools for those with severe difficulties , and mainstream schooling .
schools for children with moderate difficulties - known as mld schools - were the ones that were losing out .
mrs hutchings said most of the children attending such schools had already been in mainstream education and failed to thrive there .
inclusion often meant being taught in a corridor or a corner of a classroom .
in mld schools they might achieve some form of independence , which would benefit the country as a whole .
" conservative councils should now stop trying to close those schools or merge them because otherwise they are making a laughing stock of what michael howard and tim collins said at that press conference . "
spoke out a party spokesman said councils had " very little discretion " to act outside government guidelines .
" we would never encourage councils of whatever persuasion to break the law , " he said .
" but they may be assured that upon election of a new conservative government the law will be changed to allow parents of special needs children to choose the most appropriate education for their sons and daughters . "
mrs hutchings spoke out on friday after her contract with the daily mail newspaper ended .

in his early 20s , the wales team coach worked as a labourer for swalec , then he trained as a linesman , working on the lines between electricity poles .
it was while working in that job in nantyglo , blaenau gwent , one night that he was seriously injured after being knocked off a ladder by a lorry .
it meant the end of his burgeoning playing career .
but it was also the catalyst for his move in to coaching .
and the rest as they say , is history .
for some , ruddock 's rise through the ranks of welsh rugby was only a matter of time .
you felt you were one of the gang under mike - he was very motivational and very encouraging and gave a young player like myself a lot of confidence darryn parry retired electrical engineer derek powell , 65 , has kept in touch with the wales coach since ruddock 's first days in swalec overalls .
" he started off as a labourer for us .
he was a very quiet chap , but very efficient and sensible , " said mr powell .
" he did not stand out in the crowd , he just got on with physical work .
if mike had not had the accident , he would have had a welsh cap .
ruddock had ambitions to lead the wales team , says derek powell by chance , mr powell was in the same hospital recovering from a cartilage operation when ruddock was injured in the nantyglo fall .
" i remember going up to see mike .
he 'd had a serious injury .
i would not have thought he was very happy , but mike was always a positive person . "
one of the first to come under ruddock 's coaching wing was darryn parry , an 18 year old in cross keys ' senior team when ruddock took over the reins in 1984 .
mr parry , now a director for a construction firm , said : " he was very inspirational , and very much a do-er and a show-er in his coaching . "
tremendous enthusiasm he remembers the team spirit ruddock generated : " you felt you were one of the gang under mike .
he was very motivational and very encouraging and gave a young player like myself a lot of confidence . "
he added that ruddock always approached the game from a forward-orientated viewpoint , having played his rugby as no 6 at tredegar and then at swansea and achieving a b cap for wales .
mr parry said " it was a shame he was lost as a player .
but he took the tremendous enthusiasm he had and brought it to his coaching . "
' man management ' one of the first clubs to benefit from this was bective rangers , in south dublin .
former director of rugby , louis magee , said : " i think we all knew here he would become a really fine coach and we hoped he would be an international coach . "
mr magee said the wales team coach 's man-management skills were " outstanding " .
derek powell said that he knew ruddock always harboured desires to coach the welsh squad .
he said he spoke to him at a swansea-cardiff game just before ruddock left to work in ireland .
" i said ' we wo n't have our meetings now , then ' and he said , ' do n't worry , i 'll be back .
i will be coming back to wales ' . "

they have been waiting 18 months for the completion of their new home , monkey heights .
the buildings have been finished off with climbing frames , ropes , cargo nets and platforms indoors and out .
the next stage has begun to move the zoo 's monkeys , which include sulawesi crested macaques , colobus monkeys and diana monkeys , to the exhibit .
paignton zoo spokesman phil knowling said some monkeys had moved and were settling in , while others had still to take up residence .
he said : " keepers placed the purpose-built wooden travel crates in the colobus monkeys ' enclosure some time ago so they could get used to them .
" it 's likely that they will go in of their own accord , if not then nets are used . "
