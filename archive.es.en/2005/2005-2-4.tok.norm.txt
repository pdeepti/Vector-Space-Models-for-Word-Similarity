cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia .

" we could n't provide all the services we do without them .

many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .
company officials say they are reviewing offers carefully because they want to put quality before quantity and speed . in one case , the german government has requested € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for the repair and maintenance of the hospital in banda aceh , the main health facility in the hard-hit region of indonesia .
inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .
and in saarbrücken , about 60 schools with 36,000 students have created a project " schools for asia " to support schools and orphanages in the region . a clear interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month after a tsunami , a patchy recovery is taking place even as some areas remain almost lifeless .
at the end of january , about 50 new offers have been arriving daily even thought the catastrophe has disappeared from the headlines , say company officials .
that pleases heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for international development . " that so many offers are coming in - that is about 900 now - makes it clear how much interest there is , " she said .
" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia . " what i find very exciting is that so many communities have an interest in this , " said wieczorek-zeul .
" that shows that the idea of community partnerships are now firmly planted in people 's minds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 as state shrinks , can volunteers fill gaps ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers came through during the german floods of 2002 volunteerism in germany is not as strong as it is in the us .
many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .
in 2001 , the united nations sponsored the " year of the volunteer " and berlin used the opportunity to encourage germans to get more involved in their communities , even forming a commission to research ways to raise volunteerism rates .
almost every federal state has seen up initiatives to get citizens to donate some of the time to a worthy cause . kegel said , however , the issue of volunteering really got high visibility not due to government panels or studies , but during the devastating floods in eastern germany in august 2002 when television pictures of volunteers fighting the rising waters and cleaning up afterwards were beamed across the country . " the government played a big role but everyday people also came through and cleaned up what the water had left behind , " kegel said , adding that it showed what people pulling together to help out could actually achieve . he said he has noticed an interest in volunteering , especially among older people .
german society is aging , and there is an ever growing pool of retired people who are still in good health , but need and want something to do . guild tradition he disputes the assertion that germany has no tradition of volunteerism , saying there are roots that go back centuries to medieval trade guilds .
many social programs grew out of those guilds that provided their members services , which were later administered by government-run agencies . as the german government reins in its social state through its reform programs , charitable associations , perhaps the modern-day guild equivalent , could well take on new prominence . but according to susanne fechner of the berlin volunteer agency , germany is not yet at the point of turning over large-scale state services to the volunteer sector , although she said some first signs things are heading that way .
she said her agency is approached more often these days by institutions , for example kindergartens , which have fired their staff members and try to get volunteers to come replace them . " we wo n't send people out for these kinds of things , " she said .
" volunteers are a great enhancement , but they ca n't do everything and should n't be the reason people lose their jobs .

many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .
in 2001 , the united nations sponsored the " year of the volunteer " and berlin used the opportunity to encourage germans to get more involved in their communities , even forming a commission to research ways to raise volunteerism rates .
almost every federal state has seen up initiatives to get citizens to donate some of the time to a worthy cause . kegel said , however , the issue of volunteering really got high visibility not due to government panels or studies , but during the devastating floods in eastern germany in august 2002 when television pictures of volunteers fighting the rising waters and cleaning up afterwards were beamed across the country . " the government played a big role but everyday people also came through and cleaned up what the water had left behind , " kegel said , adding that it showed what people pulling together to help out could actually achieve . he said he has noticed an interest in volunteering , especially among older people .
german society is aging , and there is an ever growing pool of retired people who are still in good health , but need and want something to do . guild tradition he disputes the assertion that germany has no tradition of volunteerism , saying there are roots that go back centuries to medieval trade guilds .
many social programs grew out of those guilds that provided their members services , which were later administered by government-run agencies . as the german government reins in its social state through its reform programs , charitable associations , perhaps the modern-day guild equivalent , could well take on new prominence . but according to susanne fechner of the berlin volunteer agency , germany is not yet at the point of turning over large-scale state services to the volunteer sector , although she said some first signs things are heading that way .
she said her agency is approached more often these days by institutions , for example kindergartens , which have fired their staff members and try to get volunteers to come replace them . " we wo n't send people out for these kinds of things , " she said .

" as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .

almost every federal state has seen up initiatives to get citizens to donate some of the time to a worthy cause . kegel said , however , the issue of volunteering really got high visibility not due to government panels or studies , but during the devastating floods in eastern germany in august 2002 when television pictures of volunteers fighting the rising waters and cleaning up afterwards were beamed across the country . " the government played a big role but everyday people also came through and cleaned up what the water had left behind , " kegel said , adding that it showed what people pulling together to help out could actually achieve . he said he has noticed an interest in volunteering , especially among older people .

during their 25 minutes of discussions , bush also thanked the visiting german minister for berlin 's help in training iraq 's new police and military .

schily said that the president had told him he wanted to move forward relations between berlin and washington , which deteriorated markedly over the war in iraq . dw-world.de germany reluctant to participate in iraq security as us troops mount a massive offensive against the rebel-held iraqi city of fallujah on monday following attacks over the weekend , germany debates participating in nato training programs for iraqi security forces .

"
in berlin , she said iran should live up to its international obligations . on her first official visit to europe in the post she took over from colin powell one week ago , rice said it was up to iran to live up to the obligations placed on it by the international community to keep it from developing nuclear weapons . the united states has accused iran of pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program .
but iran says its nuclear endeavors are limited to peaceful power generation . in reference to the diplomatic work done by france , great britain and germany in getting iran to comply with international nuclear regulations , rice said that washington was in discussion with " our eu colleagues on a solid message to the iranians , that that is a necessity . " " it can only work if there is a unity of purpose and unity of message to the iranians , " said rice .
" the european three are giving the iranians an opportunity to demonstrate that they are prepared to live up to international obligations ... and i really do hope the iranians will take the opportunity . " schröder for diplomatic solution rice said that up until now , that had n't been the case .

" i think the steps taken so far are the right ones , " schröder said .
the two also discussed germany 's contribution to training iraqi police in the united arab emirates and schröder 's offer to expand the program .
president bush 's visit to mainz at the end of the month was also on the agenda and schröder said he was " looking forward " to the visit . discusses middle east peace with blair earlier in the day , rice had breakfast with prime minister blair . rice thanked blair for his leadership and britain 's support " as we try and spread freedom and democracy to the world , as we work to support the iraqi people in their quest and most especially ... as we try to bring to the israelis and palestinians the chance for a lasting peace . " middle east peace has been high on blair 's agenda , and the prime minister referred to ending the conflict between israelis and palestinians as high on his wish list following bush 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , greets u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice while speaking to reporters on the plane ride to britain , rice also urged arab states and other countries to boost their aid to finance palestinian reforms after washington announced a $ 350 million -lrb- € 270 million -rrb- assistance package . " absolutely we need to encourage others to contribute , " she said . rice 's next stops in europe will be poland and turkey .

" talks are expected to center on the political stability in southeast asia , as well as ongoing cooperation in reconstruction efforts for the tsunami-stricken regions . ”

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

"
in berlin , she said iran should live up to its international obligations . on her first official visit to europe in the post she took over from colin powell one week ago , rice said it was up to iran to live up to the obligations placed on it by the international community to keep it from developing nuclear weapons . the united states has accused iran of pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program .
but iran says its nuclear endeavors are limited to peaceful power generation . in reference to the diplomatic work done by france , great britain and germany in getting iran to comply with international nuclear regulations , rice said that washington was in discussion with " our eu colleagues on a solid message to the iranians , that that is a necessity . " " it can only work if there is a unity of purpose and unity of message to the iranians , " said rice .
" the european three are giving the iranians an opportunity to demonstrate that they are prepared to live up to international obligations ... and i really do hope the iranians will take the opportunity . " schröder for diplomatic solution rice said that up until now , that had n't been the case .
though rice and president george w. bush , who will follow her to germany later in february , have taken a hard line on iranian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have diplomatic means to do this .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .

known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .

it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .

what more can you want ? "
one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .
he bought the coca-cola franchise the same year and settled down with his wife , a czech actress he had married in 1932 .
anny ondra died in 1987 .
he became one of germany 's most generous philanthropists and even supported joe louis , who had fallen on tough times .
when louis died in 1981 , schmeling reportedly paid for the funeral .
" i had a happy marriage and a nice wife , " said schmeling in 1985 .

one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .

inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .

" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 " death nurse " accused of 29 murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators exhumed 42 ex-patients ' bodies to finger the culprit sonthofen hospital in bavaria has become infamous now that one of its former nurses has been accused of killing 29 patients .
the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .

inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .

that pleases heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for international development . " that so many offers are coming in - that is about 900 now - makes it clear how much interest there is , " she said .
" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia . " what i find very exciting is that so many communities have an interest in this , " said wieczorek-zeul .

1 .
the path of insolvency has been well-tread by german builders : construction giant holzmann went bankrupt two years ago .
companies created own problems after german reunification in 1990 , the government subsidized scores of construction projects in the former east germany and building companies came out of the woodwork to take part in the then lucrative business .
at the time , the construction industry created nearly half the nation 's gross domestic product .
when the large , state-financed rebuilding and renovation projects ended , there were " massive consequences to be expected " for the new companies , said volker russig of the ifo institute for economic research in munich .
europe keeps building bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction projects can be hard to see in germany a look outside of germany 's borders , however , showed a very different scenario .
while germany suffered , other nations kept on putting up new buildings .
" the rest of europe is doing significantly better than germany , " russig said .
great britain led the european construction charge .
thanks in part to structural reforms put in place years ago , there were just over 200,000 houses built on the island in 2004 , and with a lack of existing homes , experts say the country could use another 70,000 .
construction booms in usa while the sept .
11 terrorist attack in the united states were a blow to the us economy in general and construction companies also felt the effects of a reserved public that was in debt and not looking to invest in new real estate .
but most the effects proved to be temporary and low interest rates helped bring building volume went up 5.1 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in the first 10 months of 2004 - the biggest construction boom in decades , according to steffen ehninger of the german office for foreign trade in cologne .
german profits come from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will build parts of taiwan 's high-speed train track germany 's construction companies are looking to foreign countries as a way of getting out of the crisis .
to help the bottom line , german companies have moved from home to take advantage of large building projects in australia , the united states and south east asian countries .
" german construction companies have an excellent reputation abroad , " ehninger said .
" the german building industry in australia is responsible for a fourth of all sales . "
quality sets germans apart bilfinger berger , germany 's second-largest construction company , is active both in australia and taiwan , where it is taking part in building the taiwan high speed rail .
the german company will build 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- of high-speed train tracks and take in € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- .
planners said they chose the company because its technical know-how set it apart from other companies .
earlier than many others , bilfinger realized globalization would push construction work abroad and has long used cooperation partners as a way of keeping up a presence in a number of foreign countries , with projects taking place in bangkok , beijing , shanghai and sydney .
until germany 's overall economic situation improves , challenges at home will continue for the nation 's construction companies . it 's not the quality of the work that is causing the problem , according to ehninger , but " a bad environment " that is making the industry wait for a revival . constantin schreiber -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers fill french building gaps it 's not just science and technology specialists who leave germany for better jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 " death nurse " accused of 29 murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators exhumed 42 ex-patients ' bodies to finger the culprit sonthofen hospital in bavaria has become infamous now that one of its former nurses has been accused of killing 29 patients .
the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

1 .
the path of insolvency has been well-tread by german builders : construction giant holzmann went bankrupt two years ago .
companies created own problems after german reunification in 1990 , the government subsidized scores of construction projects in the former east germany and building companies came out of the woodwork to take part in the then lucrative business .
at the time , the construction industry created nearly half the nation 's gross domestic product .
when the large , state-financed rebuilding and renovation projects ended , there were " massive consequences to be expected " for the new companies , said volker russig of the ifo institute for economic research in munich .
europe keeps building bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction projects can be hard to see in germany a look outside of germany 's borders , however , showed a very different scenario .
while germany suffered , other nations kept on putting up new buildings .
" the rest of europe is doing significantly better than germany , " russig said .
great britain led the european construction charge .
thanks in part to structural reforms put in place years ago , there were just over 200,000 houses built on the island in 2004 , and with a lack of existing homes , experts say the country could use another 70,000 .

but most the effects proved to be temporary and low interest rates helped bring building volume went up 5.1 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in the first 10 months of 2004 - the biggest construction boom in decades , according to steffen ehninger of the german office for foreign trade in cologne .
german profits come from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will build parts of taiwan 's high-speed train track germany 's construction companies are looking to foreign countries as a way of getting out of the crisis .
to help the bottom line , german companies have moved from home to take advantage of large building projects in australia , the united states and south east asian countries .
" german construction companies have an excellent reputation abroad , " ehninger said .
" the german building industry in australia is responsible for a fourth of all sales . "
quality sets germans apart bilfinger berger , germany 's second-largest construction company , is active both in australia and taiwan , where it is taking part in building the taiwan high speed rail .
the german company will build 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- of high-speed train tracks and take in € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- .
planners said they chose the company because its technical know-how set it apart from other companies .
earlier than many others , bilfinger realized globalization would push construction work abroad and has long used cooperation partners as a way of keeping up a presence in a number of foreign countries , with projects taking place in bangkok , beijing , shanghai and sydney .
until germany 's overall economic situation improves , challenges at home will continue for the nation 's construction companies . it 's not the quality of the work that is causing the problem , according to ehninger , but " a bad environment " that is making the industry wait for a revival . constantin schreiber -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers fill french building gaps it 's not just science and technology specialists who leave germany for better jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 as state shrinks , can volunteers fill gaps ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers came through during the german floods of 2002 volunteerism in germany is not as strong as it is in the us .
many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .
in 2001 , the united nations sponsored the " year of the volunteer " and berlin used the opportunity to encourage germans to get more involved in their communities , even forming a commission to research ways to raise volunteerism rates .

many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .

1 .
the path of insolvency has been well-tread by german builders : construction giant holzmann went bankrupt two years ago .
companies created own problems after german reunification in 1990 , the government subsidized scores of construction projects in the former east germany and building companies came out of the woodwork to take part in the then lucrative business .
at the time , the construction industry created nearly half the nation 's gross domestic product .
when the large , state-financed rebuilding and renovation projects ended , there were " massive consequences to be expected " for the new companies , said volker russig of the ifo institute for economic research in munich .
europe keeps building bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction projects can be hard to see in germany a look outside of germany 's borders , however , showed a very different scenario .
while germany suffered , other nations kept on putting up new buildings .
" the rest of europe is doing significantly better than germany , " russig said .
great britain led the european construction charge .
thanks in part to structural reforms put in place years ago , there were just over 200,000 houses built on the island in 2004 , and with a lack of existing homes , experts say the country could use another 70,000 .
construction booms in usa while the sept .
11 terrorist attack in the united states were a blow to the us economy in general and construction companies also felt the effects of a reserved public that was in debt and not looking to invest in new real estate .
but most the effects proved to be temporary and low interest rates helped bring building volume went up 5.1 percent in 2003 and 9 percent in the first 10 months of 2004 - the biggest construction boom in decades , according to steffen ehninger of the german office for foreign trade in cologne .
german profits come from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will build parts of taiwan 's high-speed train track germany 's construction companies are looking to foreign countries as a way of getting out of the crisis .
to help the bottom line , german companies have moved from home to take advantage of large building projects in australia , the united states and south east asian countries .
" german construction companies have an excellent reputation abroad , " ehninger said .
" the german building industry in australia is responsible for a fourth of all sales . "
quality sets germans apart bilfinger berger , germany 's second-largest construction company , is active both in australia and taiwan , where it is taking part in building the taiwan high speed rail .
the german company will build 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- of high-speed train tracks and take in € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- .
planners said they chose the company because its technical know-how set it apart from other companies .
earlier than many others , bilfinger realized globalization would push construction work abroad and has long used cooperation partners as a way of keeping up a presence in a number of foreign countries , with projects taking place in bangkok , beijing , shanghai and sydney .
until germany 's overall economic situation improves , challenges at home will continue for the nation 's construction companies . it 's not the quality of the work that is causing the problem , according to ehninger , but " a bad environment " that is making the industry wait for a revival . constantin schreiber -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers fill french building gaps it 's not just science and technology specialists who leave germany for better jobs .

the path of insolvency has been well-tread by german builders : construction giant holzmann went bankrupt two years ago .
companies created own problems after german reunification in 1990 , the government subsidized scores of construction projects in the former east germany and building companies came out of the woodwork to take part in the then lucrative business .
at the time , the construction industry created nearly half the nation 's gross domestic product .
when the large , state-financed rebuilding and renovation projects ended , there were " massive consequences to be expected " for the new companies , said volker russig of the ifo institute for economic research in munich .
europe keeps building bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction projects can be hard to see in germany a look outside of germany 's borders , however , showed a very different scenario .
while germany suffered , other nations kept on putting up new buildings .
" the rest of europe is doing significantly better than germany , " russig said .
great britain led the european construction charge .
thanks in part to structural reforms put in place years ago , there were just over 200,000 houses built on the island in 2004 , and with a lack of existing homes , experts say the country could use another 70,000 .

german profits come from abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will build parts of taiwan 's high-speed train track germany 's construction companies are looking to foreign countries as a way of getting out of the crisis .
to help the bottom line , german companies have moved from home to take advantage of large building projects in australia , the united states and south east asian countries .
" german construction companies have an excellent reputation abroad , " ehninger said .
" the german building industry in australia is responsible for a fourth of all sales . "
quality sets germans apart bilfinger berger , germany 's second-largest construction company , is active both in australia and taiwan , where it is taking part in building the taiwan high speed rail .
the german company will build 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- of high-speed train tracks and take in € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- .
planners said they chose the company because its technical know-how set it apart from other companies .
earlier than many others , bilfinger realized globalization would push construction work abroad and has long used cooperation partners as a way of keeping up a presence in a number of foreign countries , with projects taking place in bangkok , beijing , shanghai and sydney .
until germany 's overall economic situation improves , challenges at home will continue for the nation 's construction companies . it 's not the quality of the work that is causing the problem , according to ehninger , but " a bad environment " that is making the industry wait for a revival . constantin schreiber -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german workers fill french building gaps it 's not just science and technology specialists who leave germany for better jobs .

the trip will also bring him to banda aceh , the region most affected by the tsunami disaster . east timor will be the foreign minister 's first stop , making him the second foreign minister from the european union to visit that country since it became independent of indonesian rule in 2002 .
" germany played a very active role at the time in the country ’ s struggle for independence and has freed considerable resources for the rebuilding of east timor ’ s infrastructure , " said walter lindner , a spokesman for the foreign ministry .
" mr. fischer will inform himself about the progress made so far in the reconstruction process . ”

" talks are expected to center on the political stability in southeast asia , as well as ongoing cooperation in reconstruction efforts for the tsunami-stricken regions . ”

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 " death nurse " accused of 29 murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators exhumed 42 ex-patients ' bodies to finger the culprit sonthofen hospital in bavaria has become infamous now that one of its former nurses has been accused of killing 29 patients .
the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 " death nurse " accused of 29 murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators exhumed 42 ex-patients ' bodies to finger the culprit sonthofen hospital in bavaria has become infamous now that one of its former nurses has been accused of killing 29 patients .
the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

what more can you want ? "
one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

"
in berlin , she said iran should live up to its international obligations . on her first official visit to europe in the post she took over from colin powell one week ago , rice said it was up to iran to live up to the obligations placed on it by the international community to keep it from developing nuclear weapons . the united states has accused iran of pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program .
but iran says its nuclear endeavors are limited to peaceful power generation . in reference to the diplomatic work done by france , great britain and germany in getting iran to comply with international nuclear regulations , rice said that washington was in discussion with " our eu colleagues on a solid message to the iranians , that that is a necessity . " " it can only work if there is a unity of purpose and unity of message to the iranians , " said rice .
" the european three are giving the iranians an opportunity to demonstrate that they are prepared to live up to international obligations ... and i really do hope the iranians will take the opportunity . " schröder for diplomatic solution rice said that up until now , that had n't been the case .
though rice and president george w. bush , who will follow her to germany later in february , have taken a hard line on iranian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have diplomatic means to do this . " compliance , rice told reporters in london earlier in the day that the question of the attack was " simply not on the agenda .
we have diplomatic means to do this . " chancellor schröder told reporters that his government would continue to look for a " political and diplomatic solution " to the problem .
" i think the steps taken so far are the right ones , " schröder said .
the two also discussed germany 's contribution to training iraqi police in the united arab emirates and schröder 's offer to expand the program .
president bush 's visit to mainz at the end of the month was also on the agenda and schröder said he was " looking forward " to the visit . discusses middle east peace with blair earlier in the day , rice had breakfast with prime minister blair . rice thanked blair for his leadership and britain 's support " as we try and spread freedom and democracy to the world , as we work to support the iraqi people in their quest and most especially ... as we try to bring to the israelis and palestinians the chance for a lasting peace . " middle east peace has been high on blair 's agenda , and the prime minister referred to ending the conflict between israelis and palestinians as high on his wish list following bush 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , greets u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice while speaking to reporters on the plane ride to britain , rice also urged arab states and other countries to boost their aid to finance palestinian reforms after washington announced a $ 350 million -lrb- € 270 million -rrb- assistance package . " absolutely we need to encourage others to contribute , " she said . rice 's next stops in europe will be poland and turkey .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .
company officials say they are reviewing offers carefully because they want to put quality before quantity and speed . in one case , the german government has requested € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for the repair and maintenance of the hospital in banda aceh , the main health facility in the hard-hit region of indonesia .
inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .
and in saarbrücken , about 60 schools with 36,000 students have created a project " schools for asia " to support schools and orphanages in the region . a clear interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month after a tsunami , a patchy recovery is taking place even as some areas remain almost lifeless .
at the end of january , about 50 new offers have been arriving daily even thought the catastrophe has disappeared from the headlines , say company officials .
that pleases heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for international development . " that so many offers are coming in - that is about 900 now - makes it clear how much interest there is , " she said .
" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia . " what i find very exciting is that so many communities have an interest in this , " said wieczorek-zeul .
" that shows that the idea of community partnerships are now firmly planted in people 's minds .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .
company officials say they are reviewing offers carefully because they want to put quality before quantity and speed . in one case , the german government has requested € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for the repair and maintenance of the hospital in banda aceh , the main health facility in the hard-hit region of indonesia .
inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .
and in saarbrücken , about 60 schools with 36,000 students have created a project " schools for asia " to support schools and orphanages in the region . a clear interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month after a tsunami , a patchy recovery is taking place even as some areas remain almost lifeless .
at the end of january , about 50 new offers have been arriving daily even thought the catastrophe has disappeared from the headlines , say company officials .
that pleases heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for international development . " that so many offers are coming in - that is about 900 now - makes it clear how much interest there is , " she said .
" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia . " what i find very exciting is that so many communities have an interest in this , " said wieczorek-zeul .
" that shows that the idea of community partnerships are now firmly planted in people 's minds .

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .

the trip will also bring him to banda aceh , the region most affected by the tsunami disaster . east timor will be the foreign minister 's first stop , making him the second foreign minister from the european union to visit that country since it became independent of indonesian rule in 2002 .
" germany played a very active role at the time in the country ’ s struggle for independence and has freed considerable resources for the rebuilding of east timor ’ s infrastructure , " said walter lindner , a spokesman for the foreign ministry .
" mr. fischer will inform himself about the progress made so far in the reconstruction process . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany played a large role in supporting east timor 's struggle for independence two years ago the trip marks the minister 's third visit to asia in eight months , underscoring the growing economic and political importance of the region to germany .
fischer has stepped up his travel schedule in recent months since germany launched a bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council as part of a proposed reform of the organization .

no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

what more can you want ? "
one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .

no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .
he bought the coca-cola franchise the same year and settled down with his wife , a czech actress he had married in 1932 .
anny ondra died in 1987 .
he became one of germany 's most generous philanthropists and even supported joe louis , who had fallen on tough times .
when louis died in 1981 , schmeling reportedly paid for the funeral .
" i had a happy marriage and a nice wife , " said schmeling in 1985 .
" i accomplished everything you can .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .

" germany played a very active role at the time in the country ’ s struggle for independence and has freed considerable resources for the rebuilding of east timor ’ s infrastructure , " said walter lindner , a spokesman for the foreign ministry .

he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .

on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .

it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .

in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .

many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .
in 2001 , the united nations sponsored the " year of the volunteer " and berlin used the opportunity to encourage germans to get more involved in their communities , even forming a commission to research ways to raise volunteerism rates .
almost every federal state has seen up initiatives to get citizens to donate some of the time to a worthy cause . kegel said , however , the issue of volunteering really got high visibility not due to government panels or studies , but during the devastating floods in eastern germany in august 2002 when television pictures of volunteers fighting the rising waters and cleaning up afterwards were beamed across the country . " the government played a big role but everyday people also came through and cleaned up what the water had left behind , " kegel said , adding that it showed what people pulling together to help out could actually achieve . he said he has noticed an interest in volunteering , especially among older people .
german society is aging , and there is an ever growing pool of retired people who are still in good health , but need and want something to do . guild tradition he disputes the assertion that germany has no tradition of volunteerism , saying there are roots that go back centuries to medieval trade guilds .
many social programs grew out of those guilds that provided their members services , which were later administered by government-run agencies . as the german government reins in its social state through its reform programs , charitable associations , perhaps the modern-day guild equivalent , could well take on new prominence . but according to susanne fechner of the berlin volunteer agency , germany is not yet at the point of turning over large-scale state services to the volunteer sector , although she said some first signs things are heading that way .
she said her agency is approached more often these days by institutions , for example kindergartens , which have fired their staff members and try to get volunteers to come replace them . " we wo n't send people out for these kinds of things , " she said .
" volunteers are a great enhancement , but they ca n't do everything and should n't be the reason people lose their jobs .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .

many germans traditionally felt it was the government 's role to take care of problems .
but as state coffers run dry , attitudes are changing . when someone with questions about aids calls the hotline at berlin aids hilfe , an organization which provides counselling and other services to people with the disease , the person answering the phone is n't on the payroll .
they 're working for free . volunteers also provide the bulk of the manpower for the group 's education programs , one-on-one support services , and a host of other activities .
while berlin aids hilfe has only 15 paid staff members , some 200 people work for the organization on a volunteer basis . " they do so much for us , " said director kai-uwe merkenich .
" we could n't provide all the services we do without them . " as germany finds itself facing an aging population and a shrinking tax base and institutes reforms that cut back on state expenditures , volunteers will likely be increasingly called to step up and provide services that were once paid for by the government .
according to several professionals in the volunteer field , many germans are beginning to realize this . " the state can not finance certain things anymore , " said thomas kegel , head of the volunteerism academy , a group which provides training in volunteer and non-profit organization management .
" we in germany want to keep our social-welfare state , but that will only happen if people start getting involved and helping each other out . " volunteerism rates people do already volunteer in germany , although not in the numbers that they do in the united states .
a study carried out for germany 's family ministry looking at volunteerism rates found that 34 percent of germans are involved in some kind of volunteer activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteer fire brigades have a long tradition in germany .
the percentages are slightly higher in the south and west of the country , slightly lower in the north and east . a survey in the united states by the gallup polling organization in the 1990s , however , found that nationwide more than 40 percent of americans participated in some kind of volunteer activity .
among white americans , 51 percent reported they did some kind of volunteer work regularly . " the protestant work ethic is much stronger in america , " said steffen micheel , a spokesman for günter nooke , a parliamentarian who organized a recent volunteering conference in the german capital called " berlin helps itself . "
he said europeans have a long history of relying on others to take care of many of their needs . " first it was the princes and other rulers and later on the state took over the role , " he said .
" germans have a kind of mentality of expecting ' comprehensive coverage , ' but i think there is a change in public opinion taking place . " attitude shift according to thomas kegel of the volunteer academy , attitude toward volunteerism have been slowly changing for several decades .
he said the shift was sparked by the 1968 protest movement in germany , when citizens began forming associations with charitable purposes . " they did n't want to wait for the state , " he said .
" and now , the state has a real interest in encouraging that kind of thinking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations logo for international volunteer day -lrb- ivd -rrb- on december 5 .
in 2001 , the united nations sponsored the " year of the volunteer " and berlin used the opportunity to encourage germans to get more involved in their communities , even forming a commission to research ways to raise volunteerism rates .
almost every federal state has seen up initiatives to get citizens to donate some of the time to a worthy cause . kegel said , however , the issue of volunteering really got high visibility not due to government panels or studies , but during the devastating floods in eastern germany in august 2002 when television pictures of volunteers fighting the rising waters and cleaning up afterwards were beamed across the country . " the government played a big role but everyday people also came through and cleaned up what the water had left behind , " kegel said , adding that it showed what people pulling together to help out could actually achieve . he said he has noticed an interest in volunteering , especially among older people .
german society is aging , and there is an ever growing pool of retired people who are still in good health , but need and want something to do . guild tradition he disputes the assertion that germany has no tradition of volunteerism , saying there are roots that go back centuries to medieval trade guilds .
many social programs grew out of those guilds that provided their members services , which were later administered by government-run agencies . as the german government reins in its social state through its reform programs , charitable associations , perhaps the modern-day guild equivalent , could well take on new prominence . but according to susanne fechner of the berlin volunteer agency , germany is not yet at the point of turning over large-scale state services to the volunteer sector , although she said some first signs things are heading that way .
she said her agency is approached more often these days by institutions , for example kindergartens , which have fired their staff members and try to get volunteers to come replace them . " we wo n't send people out for these kinds of things , " she said .

in indonesia alone , 132,000 are missing a month after the disaster .
the rebuilding of destroyed villages and cities will take years . long-term sustainable support is urgently needed , according to german officials . for this reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for regional partnership initiatives in his new year 's speech .
and his compatriots are heeding his call : already hundreds of concrete offers are lying on the desk of bonn-based inwent gmbh , which has been charged with coordinating them and advising volunteers by the federal ministry for international development . the goal of the chancellor 's initiative is a direct and sustainable cooperation between citizens , associations , businesses , schools , communities and the affected areas .
and so far , there has been a wide resonance : bonn , hamburg , potsdam - cities across germany are answer the call . politicians and citizens are coming together and coming up with ideas to promote sustainable redevelopment in the affected areas . " we have a chance for the communities not only to help in rebuilding the region but also to offer solidarity , " said ulrich nitschke , who heads the coordination for inwent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake and tsunami that shattered indonesia 's aceh province caused damage and losses worth $ 4.5 billion -lrb- € 3.45 billion -rrb- . quality before quantity a month after the quake and floods , the hotline at inwent does not stay quiet - there are already 900 offers of help from all over germany .
company officials say they are reviewing offers carefully because they want to put quality before quantity and speed . in one case , the german government has requested € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for the repair and maintenance of the hospital in banda aceh , the main health facility in the hard-hit region of indonesia .
inwent is coordinating between the government and professional german soccer players , who are raising money through benefit appearances . the twon of regensburg has already secured help for the fisherman of sri lanka by collecting money for boats and houses for those that lost everything .
and in saarbrücken , about 60 schools with 36,000 students have created a project " schools for asia " to support schools and orphanages in the region . a clear interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a month after a tsunami , a patchy recovery is taking place even as some areas remain almost lifeless .
at the end of january , about 50 new offers have been arriving daily even thought the catastrophe has disappeared from the headlines , say company officials .
that pleases heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for international development . " that so many offers are coming in - that is about 900 now - makes it clear how much interest there is , " she said .
" it is important now that these efforts become sustainable . " officials say that partnerships with communities in devastated regions are an effective way to create such development .
for example , potsdam is helping its sister city , galle , sri lanka , to rebuild a school .
cities such as frankfurt are lending a hand to their already established sister cities with such projects as rebuilding libraries , sewage plants and orphanages . in 2004 , there were a total of 646 german communities in partnerships with other communities in developing countries such as berlin with jakarta or hildesheim with padang , indonesia . " what i find very exciting is that so many communities have an interest in this , " said wieczorek-zeul .
" that shows that the idea of community partnerships are now firmly planted in people 's minds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.02.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc deutsche bank cuts anger politicians german politicians expressed outrage on friday at plans by the country 's biggest - and highest earning - bank , deutsche bank , to slash thousands of jobs at a time when employment in the euro zone 's biggest economy is at a postwar high . " it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 " death nurse " accused of 29 murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators exhumed 42 ex-patients ' bodies to finger the culprit sonthofen hospital in bavaria has become infamous now that one of its former nurses has been accused of killing 29 patients .
the man claims he was putting his victims out of their misery . the 26-year-old who german tabloids have dubbed the " death nurse " has admitted to killing 16 patients .
now the prosecutor 's office is charging the suspect with another 13 killings .
investigators presume that six of the cases were homicide , 22 were manslaughter , and one was a case of killing on demand . the results of autopsies have been a milestone in the investigation , according to chief prosecutor herbert pollert . " until about two weeks ago , the only proof we had was the suspect 's confession , " he said .
" we found that plausible , but now we have scientific proof that the accused did indeed use the fatal medication . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sonthofen hospital the nurse began working at sonthofen hospital in january 2003 .
investigators said the man began his series of murders one month later .
he apparently stole drugs from a medicine cabinet - tranquilizers that paralyze muscles and anesthetics that can arrest breathing .
the shots he gave were deadly within five minutes .
most of the victims were older patients .
two victims were seriously ill women in their mid-40s . the nurse said he wanted to put an end to the patients ' suffering .
but he also admitted that six patients were not seriously ill , such as a 73-year-old woman who had made plans with her family for the time after her release from the hospital .
thus , the prosecutor has accused the suspect of murder through devious means . ground-breaking pathologists had trouble finding traces of the medication in the victims ' bodies a year and a half after their deaths .
they had to be dug up from burial sites .
six of the other victims had already been cremated . criminal investigation chief albert müller said the case had broken new ground . " we had n't had any scientific experience with these medications before , " he said .
" but now we 've been able to prove that the tranquilizing shots were given in very high doses right before the deaths .
so we can say in these cases that suspicions have hardened . " an arraignment date has not yet been set .
police and prosecutors say a psychological report must first determine whether or not the suspect 's claim that he killed out of compassion is plausible . at the same time , silvia grauvogel of the german association of caregivers said the case raises other issues that should be addressed .
the drugs the nurse is said to have used should n't have been accessible to him in the first place , she told dw-radio . " how could a caregiver get access to such a dangerous , potent drug , " grauvogel asked .
" how could it end up in that department where it 's normally not used ?
drugs like that are only used in intensive care units or the anesthetics department .
how come no one noticed that large amounts of the drugs were disappearing ?

what more can you want ? "
one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .
he bought the coca-cola franchise the same year and settled down with his wife , a czech actress he had married in 1932 .
anny ondra died in 1987 .
he became one of germany 's most generous philanthropists and even supported joe louis , who had fallen on tough times .
when louis died in 1981 , schmeling reportedly paid for the funeral .
" i had a happy marriage and a nice wife , " said schmeling in 1985 .
" i accomplished everything you can .

the race for the white house europe -pipe- 04.02.2005 opinion : bush 's second-term task großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will have to do a lot of persuading this time round politics is about power and persuasion .
getting the mix right is part of any president 's challenge , particularly if a second term is involved , comments jackson janes on president bush 's state of the union address . president bush is beginning his second term with a lot of power .
he won more votes than any other president .
his party has control of both the senate and the house of representatives with larger majorities than during his first term .
yet his ability to persuade is more limited .
he has a very low approval rating in a country which is very much divided over many issues and concerns .
and second terms are famously full of examples where presidents have all too often gone wrong . that can be explained in part because of a feeling of hubris which another four years in the white house must generate .
but there are also the unexpected , the uncontrolled , and the underestimated events which can sweep over the white house like a tsunami .
nixon 's fate after watergate , reagan 's iran-contra affair , and clinton 's impeachment are all permanent warning signs for future presidents as well as the current one . none of that seemed to matter to president bush as he delivered his fifth state of the union speech .
he appeared as a confident leader , convinced of his missions to make history . bildunterschrift : bush was inaugurated for the second time on jan .
20 the state of the union address has to be understood as the second part of his inauguration speech .
when he took the oath of office on jan .
20 , he spoke about the world and what his vision of its future should be .
on wednesday , he spent more time on the agenda he envisions for the united states , focusing particularly on the future of social security .
at the inauguration , he focused on international security and how the united states has a special obligation to itself and the world to provide the framework for achieving it .
he stressed that the security of the united states was dependent on the security of the rest of the world .
in the state of the union speech , he argued that americans individual social security should be less dependent on the state and more on their own decisions and choices . focus on the future in both speeches , the president was talking about big ideas , whether it be spreading freedom around the globe or securing the future of social security at home .
with those objectives in mind , he is not thinking about the next four years .
he is thinking more about the next 40 . george w. bush is attacking his second term with a recipe for radical reform , at home and abroad . his decision to go into iraq was driven as much by the mistaken belief that saddam had weapons of mass destruction as by the belief that a change in iraq was the key to changing the entire middle east .
this was radical surgery , even if it was elective .
the iraqi elections serve as clear evidence for the president that his decision was the right one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet norwood -lrb- right -rrb- of pfugerville , texas , whose son was killed in iraq last year , hugs safia taleb al-suhail , leader of the iraqi women 's political council , during the state of the union address during the state of the union speech , the symbolism of american security tied to establishing iraqi democracy was dramatically demonstrated by an american woman whose sons was killed in fallujah embracing an iraqi woman who had just voted in her first election .
if politics is also theater , that was the high point of the show . it has been president bush 's mantra that eliminating the threat of saddam was central to the war against terrorism and to securing peace in the middle east .
he believes that setting the basis for long-term peace beginning with iraq will be a generational task , similar to the task facing american leadership after world war ii .
he made that clear in his inauguration speech as well as in the state of the union address .
he will spend the next four years trying to persuade nervous americans and the rest of the world that this is the right course , no matter how much it costs and what sacrifices are required .
difficulties ahead the president has also decided that his legacy will not only be shaped by iraq but also by his efforts to reshape the parameters of american social security .
known as the third rail of american politics - a dangerous issue to touch for any politicians hoping to avoid political electrocution - social security is the keystone of the relationship between the government and the citizen . by recommending changes in this relationship , the president is again engaged in radical surgery .
like iraq , he sees this as a necessary step for prevention and preemption of dangers in the future .
and , as with iraq , he will be facing four years of trying to persuade americans that these dangers are imminent and threatening .
it will not be an easy path and the results are unpredictable . president bush has enormous power , but in a second term , without the possibility of being reelected , that power will gradually wane as the search for his successor begins .
in order for the president to achieve even part of his agenda , he will have to rely increasingly on his power of persuasion well beyond his loyal supporters .
second terms do not make that task easy .
in over half a century , only three presidents before bush had the opportunity to try .
during the first term , president bush seemed more inclined to use power .
during the second term , he will have to get along with more persuasion .
getting the mix right will be a challenge .

" it 's a scandal , " the deputy chief whip of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat spd party , michael müller , told the regional daily berliner zeitung .
" it 's outrageous that the earnings expectations are being raised at the cost of jobs . "
similar tones were heard from the environmentalist green party , the spd 's partner in the ruling coalition .
deutsche bank 's cost-cuttings plans were " highly problematic " at a time when unemployment in germany stands at more than five million , the highest level since the war , said the green party 's finance expert christine scheel .
but politicians were not in a position to do anything about it , she regretted .
even the conservative opposition was up in arms .
" it 's a sign that business ethics are in danger of disappearing , " cdu parliamentarian gerald weiss told the berliner zeitung .
on thursday , deutsche bank said it was planning to axe or relocate some 6,400 jobs in all , equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce , after running up a net profit of around € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- , the highest in four years .
the aim of the additional blood-letting was to catapult deutsche bank into one of the biggest banks in the world in terms of market capitalization from its current no. 23 ranking , chairman josef ackermann said . dw-world.de deutsche bank mulls job cuts deutsche bank , germany 's biggest bank , is considering cutting jobs in its high-street banking operations and even moving its administrative headquarters away from germany in the long run , the bank 's supervisory board chief said in an interview with the weekly stern magazine .

their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .

" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .
he bought the coca-cola franchise the same year and settled down with his wife , a czech actress he had married in 1932 .
anny ondra died in 1987 .
he became one of germany 's most generous philanthropists and even supported joe louis , who had fallen on tough times .
when louis died in 1981 , schmeling reportedly paid for the funeral .
" i had a happy marriage and a nice wife , " said schmeling in 1985 .

no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .

their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .

after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .

their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc thousands protest university fee ruling thousands of students hit the streets of several german cities on thursday to protest a court ruling that is likely to see the introduction of fees at universities .
the biggest rally took place in hamburg , northern germany , where up to 10,000 students turned out , while 8,000 protested in leipzig in the east , more than 4,000 in mannheim to the southwest and 1,000 in the western city of essen .
around 1,000 also demonstrated in the capital berlin .
some were seen holding banners marked : " study fees are the death of education " and " education is not a product . "
germany 's highest court ruled on jan .
26 that the 16 federal states can charge tuition fees for universities , breaking with a long tradition of free higher education .

the biggest rally took place in hamburg , northern germany , where up to 10,000 students turned out , while 8,000 protested in leipzig in the east , more than 4,000 in mannheim to the southwest and 1,000 in the western city of essen .
around 1,000 also demonstrated in the capital berlin .
some were seen holding banners marked : " study fees are the death of education " and " education is not a product . "
germany 's highest court ruled on jan .
26 that the 16 federal states can charge tuition fees for universities , breaking with a long tradition of free higher education .
the ruling came in response to a complaint from six regions governed by the conservative christian union parties which wanted to introduce fees to make up a funding shortfall .
five of the states said they would soon introduce a fee of about € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester to improve the quality of education at the tax-financed institutions .
it is not unusual for students here to pursue a degree well into their 30s .
in 2002 , the government of chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , imposed a blanket ban on tuition fees for students beginning their courses .
education minister edelgard bulmahn has said that the states must now ensure that families who can not afford the fees are given financial aid . dw-world.de germany divided over tuition fees ruling reactions to the german high court 's decision to allow individual federal states to charge tuition fees have been mixed since judges declared the law banning the imposition of fees unconstitutional on wednesday .

one of the boxing world 's most famous champions , and one of germany 's most cherished sports legends , max schmeling , died this week at the age of 99 . dominating in the ring , quiet and generous outside of it , max schmeling won one of the most storied bouts in boxing history and praise for his quiet resistance against hitler and the nazis . schmeling , who spent his years after boxing running a coca cola franchise , died on wednesday in his home in hollenstedt , near hamburg .
no cause of death was given . " his success as a world heavyweight boxing champion , his international reputation as a sportsman , an idol , will not be forgotten , " said hamburg mayor ole von beust .
" up until his death he was loved world wide and is an irreplaceable sporting and human role model . "
the city plans to hold a memorial service for schmeling on march 1 . the first german world champion born sept 28 , 1905 in klein luckow , a town in the eastern german state of brandenburg , schmeling became a pro boxer in 1924 at the age of 19 .
three years later , he became german heavyweight champ and then moved to the united states to train . his american period proved the most successful and most difficult of his career , when critics portrayed him as a nazi sympathizer as hitler gained power in germany .
schmeling won the world heavyweight crown in 1930 , beating joe sharkey when the american was disqualified for hitting below the belt .
he defended it in 1931 before losing in 1933 to max baer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max schemling beating joe sharkey for ther heavyweight belt in 1930 hitler tried repeatedly to get the new celebrity on his side .
although schmeling lunched with the german dictator and reportedly had long discussions with goebbels , he refused to join the nazi party . bout against louis becomes political in 1936 , he scored a sensation by knocking out american boxing legend joe louis , at the time a young but promising boxer .
when the two met for a rematch two years later , it was n't just about boxing anymore . bildunterschrift : max schmeling , right , throws a right at joe louis in an early round of their heavyweight bout in new york city , june 19 , 1936 .
schmeling knocked louis out in the 12th round of the scheduled 15 round boxing match . schmeling , who made hitler promise to protect us athletes during the 1936 olympics in berlin , was unfairly cast as the aryan hero of nazi germany and louis as the proud , fearless american .
us president franklin roosevelt invited louis to the white house and urged him to victory .
their bout in front of 70,000 people at yankee stadium was over after 2 minutes and 4 seconds , when louis sent schmeling down to the mat for the fourth and final time .
" looking back i 'm almost happy i lost that fight , " schmeling said in 1975 , according to the associated press .
" just imagine if i would have come back to germany with a victory .
i had nothing to do with the nazis , but they would have given me a medal .
after the war i might have been considered a war criminal . " hid jews during kristallnacht when the nazis terrorized germany 's jewish population during kristallnacht in 1938 , schmeling hid the sons of his jewish friend david lewin in his hotel room .
his refusal to join the nazi party annoyed hitler who drafted him into a paratroopers unit and sent him on dangerous missions . though he fought a few bouts after the war , he was never able to repeat his success and retired in 1948 with a record of 56-10-4 , with 39 knockouts .
he bought the coca-cola franchise the same year and settled down with his wife , a czech actress he had married in 1932 .
anny ondra died in 1987 .
he became one of germany 's most generous philanthropists and even supported joe louis , who had fallen on tough times .
when louis died in 1981 , schmeling reportedly paid for the funeral .

in just six months the campaign has grabbed numerous headlines and can count on the support of pop stars , clergy and statesmen alike .
so what are the coalition 's aims ?
how is it funded ?
how are the churches involved ?
what has it got to do with the politicians ?
why does it attract the celebrities ?
and just what are those wristbands ?
aims the coalition says world poverty is sustained not by nature but by factors such as global trade , debt and insufficient and ineffective aid which are exacerbated by " inappropriate " economic policies .
it hopes the uk presidencies of the g8 and the european union along with the 20th anniversary of live aid will galvanise the western world into action .
it says a " sea change " to compel developed countries to fulfil their " obligations " could see an end to poverty .
it says policy change in three areas - trade , debt and aid - would stop the suffering .
it calls for actions such as ending export subsidies , dropping unpayable debt and giving us $ 50 billion -lrb- £ 26.6 billion -rrb- more in aid .
return to top funding the campaign is supported by more than 200 charities , campaigns , trade unions , faith groups and celebrities .
these range from oxfam to the church of england to the transport and general workers ' union , which have all contributed to the cause .
dr charles reed of the church of england said : " it is not a hierarchal organisation .
all of the organisations feel a part-ownership in the campaign and for it to be a success they must contribute to the running costs .
" they have all put their hands in their pockets to make this happen . "
return to top churches a number of churches and religious groups are involved in the campaign - recently the vicar of dibley , comic dawn french , led hundreds of women clergy to number 10 to sing hymns and take their poverty message to the heart of government .
the church of england , methodist and baptist churches have all signed up , while groups such as the catholic agency for overseas development -lrb- cafod -rrb- , muslim aid , and the jewish council for racial equality are all involved .
dr charles reed , adviser on international policy to the church of england , said as churches worked in every part of the country they had a network in which to put the " clear " message of make poverty history across .
and , he said , they were part of a wider church working in areas around the world directly affected by poverty .
return to top politicians it is not often campaigners find themselves meeting a smiling prime minister on the doorstep as they deliver a petition to downing street , or find the chancellor publicly praising their message - but somehow make poverty history has found powerful ears all-too ready to listen .
gordon brown might be convinced " a new deal for all developing countries that will address the underlying causes of their poverty , their illiteracy and their disease " is the way forward - as he recently told the united nations development programme - but that is not to say they agree whole-heartedly .
some in make poverty history express scepticism at mr brown 's recently announced " marshall plan for africa " .
unlike the chancellor they want debt relief without conditions .
however he has been sporting the organisation 's wristband and was backed by singer bono at the world economic forum in davos .
return to top celebrities " we can make extreme poverty history , i really believe that , " said u2 frontman bono .
" the kind of stupid poverty where kids are dying for the lack of an immunisation that costs 20 cents , or for lack of food in a world of plenty .
do n't we want to be the generation that says no to that ? "
the mph campaign has attracted the likes of notting hill writer richard curtis , comic dawn french , actor rhys ifans and r & b star jamelia .
richard curtis is devoting a year to the campaign and it is backed by comic relief .
there is a real feeling it is make-or-break time to tackle poverty , said a spokesman , so many celebrities feel if they can use their influence to change things then so much the better .
fran healy of travis said : " no-one can be oblivious or ignorant to the plight of the poor , nor to the responsibility our governments have as architects of their poverty . "
band aid founder bob geldof is also using his experience of charity drives to spearhead the campaign .
" the reality is that only politics created this dilemma and only politics can resolve it , " he said .
return to top wristbands the white band - which is worn around the wrist , as a hairband or around the arm - is meant to signify support for the campaign , numerous celebrities have been snapped wearing the items .
they come in cotton or silicon , cost £ 1 and can be bought direct from make poverty history and its supporters or in oxfam shops .

dr charles reed , adviser on international policy to the church of england , said as churches worked in every part of the country they had a network in which to put the " clear " message of make poverty history across .

in just six months the campaign has grabbed numerous headlines and can count on the support of pop stars , clergy and statesmen alike .
so what are the coalition 's aims ?
how is it funded ?
how are the churches involved ?
what has it got to do with the politicians ?
why does it attract the celebrities ?
and just what are those wristbands ?
aims the coalition says world poverty is sustained not by nature but by factors such as global trade , debt and insufficient and ineffective aid which are exacerbated by " inappropriate " economic policies .
it hopes the uk presidencies of the g8 and the european union along with the 20th anniversary of live aid will galvanise the western world into action .
it says a " sea change " to compel developed countries to fulfil their " obligations " could see an end to poverty .
it says policy change in three areas - trade , debt and aid - would stop the suffering .
it calls for actions such as ending export subsidies , dropping unpayable debt and giving us $ 50 billion -lrb- £ 26.6 billion -rrb- more in aid .
return to top funding the campaign is supported by more than 200 charities , campaigns , trade unions , faith groups and celebrities .
these range from oxfam to the church of england to the transport and general workers ' union , which have all contributed to the cause .
dr charles reed of the church of england said : " it is not a hierarchal organisation .
all of the organisations feel a part-ownership in the campaign and for it to be a success they must contribute to the running costs .
" they have all put their hands in their pockets to make this happen . "
return to top churches a number of churches and religious groups are involved in the campaign - recently the vicar of dibley , comic dawn french , led hundreds of women clergy to number 10 to sing hymns and take their poverty message to the heart of government .
the church of england , methodist and baptist churches have all signed up , while groups such as the catholic agency for overseas development -lrb- cafod -rrb- , muslim aid , and the jewish council for racial equality are all involved .
dr charles reed , adviser on international policy to the church of england , said as churches worked in every part of the country they had a network in which to put the " clear " message of make poverty history across .
and , he said , they were part of a wider church working in areas around the world directly affected by poverty .
return to top politicians it is not often campaigners find themselves meeting a smiling prime minister on the doorstep as they deliver a petition to downing street , or find the chancellor publicly praising their message - but somehow make poverty history has found powerful ears all-too ready to listen .
gordon brown might be convinced " a new deal for all developing countries that will address the underlying causes of their poverty , their illiteracy and their disease " is the way forward - as he recently told the united nations development programme - but that is not to say they agree whole-heartedly .
some in make poverty history express scepticism at mr brown 's recently announced " marshall plan for africa " .
unlike the chancellor they want debt relief without conditions .
however he has been sporting the organisation 's wristband and was backed by singer bono at the world economic forum in davos .
return to top celebrities " we can make extreme poverty history , i really believe that , " said u2 frontman bono .
" the kind of stupid poverty where kids are dying for the lack of an immunisation that costs 20 cents , or for lack of food in a world of plenty .
do n't we want to be the generation that says no to that ? "
the mph campaign has attracted the likes of notting hill writer richard curtis , comic dawn french , actor rhys ifans and r & b star jamelia .
richard curtis is devoting a year to the campaign and it is backed by comic relief .
there is a real feeling it is make-or-break time to tackle poverty , said a spokesman , so many celebrities feel if they can use their influence to change things then so much the better .
fran healy of travis said : " no-one can be oblivious or ignorant to the plight of the poor , nor to the responsibility our governments have as architects of their poverty . "
band aid founder bob geldof is also using his experience of charity drives to spearhead the campaign .

one mp has already been arrested after thursday 's ruling , and sam rainsy himself has left the country .
cambodia 's king norodom sihamoni has promised not to enter into his country 's often murky political arena .
but a sam rainsy party spokesman said he would send a letter to the king to ask that the mps ' immunity be restored .
" they should not have been stripped as parliamentarians when all they did was express their own opinions , " eng chhay eang said .
the government " have kicked out the opposition voice " , he said , adding that sam rainsy party mps were planning to boycott parliament for a period of time in protest .
' sad day for democracy ' on thursday cambodia 's national assembly achieved the two-thirds majority it needed to overturn rules protecting sam rainsy and his colleagues cheam channy and chea poch from prosecution .
sam rainsy 1949 : born in phnom penh 1965 : leaves cambodia for france 1989 : becomes funcinpec 's european representative 1993 : back in cambodia , becomes finance minister 1994 : expelled from funcinpec 1995 : founds the khmer nation party , later renamed the sam rainsy party 2003 : party polls 22 % in general election 2005 : leaves the country after losing parliamentary immunity as a result of the decision , the three men could face a series of defamation charges - which could force them to pay hefty fines or even spend time in jail .
hours after the decision , sam rainsy left the country and is believed to have travelled first to bangkok and then to paris .
cheam channy was taken into custody by police on thursday afternoon , and has reportedly been charged with starting an anti-hun sen militia .
chea poch is thought to be in hiding .
us condemnation prime minister hun sen first filed a libel suit against sam rainsy last year , for accusing the government of plotting to kill its political rivals .
the other party in the coalition government , prince norodom ranariddh 's funcinpec party , has also begun defamation action against sam rainsy .
sam rainsy alleged that prince ranariddh took bribes to join forces with hun sen 's cambodian people 's party to form the government - a move funcinpec denies .
a us senator said in a statement late on thursday that washington should take tough action against cambodia for stripping sam rainsy of his immunity .
after parliament 's decision , prime minister hun sen was unrepentant kentucky republican senator mitch mcconnell said the move was " outrageous and unacceptable " , and urged the us state department to respond in " a forceful and appropriate manner " .
the us embassy in phnom penh also condemned the parliament 's decision on thursday .
" we are deeply concerned that the national assembly has chosen to occupy itself with political activity that appears to be designed to silence the opposition , " it said in a statement .
but prince ranariddh was unrepentant .
" i think this a cambodian domestic issue .
we have the full right to solve it according to the rule of the laws of cambodia , " he is quoted as saying by reuters news agency on friday .

there have been 4,891 suspected cases reported to the health protection agency in the first four weeks of the year , compared with 467 last january .
more than two-thirds of those affected are aged between 13 and 24 , who missed out on the mmr jab as children .
experts are urging people in that age group to ensure they are protected .
what we are seeing is a group of people who have not been exposed to mumps as children and who have not been vaccinated with mmr dr nick phinn , health protection agency alert over student mumps outbreak mumps is a viral infection that is transmitted through airborne droplets from the coughs and sneezes of infected people .
it is spread through being in close contact with an infected person and is spread by kissing , coughing or sneezing .

up to 75 % of cases notified by gps are confirmed as mumps once laboratory tests have been carried out .
the combined measles , mumps and rubella vaccination was not introduced until 1988 .
and the booster jab was not brought in until the mid 1990s , so children born between those dates are more vulnerable to mumps than those who have had both immunisations .
some universities , including birmingham , kent , leeds , manchester , nottingham and oxford have introduced vaccination programmes for students so those who missed out can be immunised .
swelling dr nick phinn , a consultant in communicable diseases at the health protection agency , told bbc five live : " what we are seeing is a group of people between 13 and 24 who have not been exposed to mumps as children because mmr has been so effective , and who have not been vaccinated with mmr because it was only introduced in 1988 .

the vast majority of people make an easy recovery from mumps infection .

the school truancy rate is the same as in 1997 - 0.7 % - but fewer children are missing classes for authorised absences such as illness or holidays .
a report from the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- calls for central government to work more closely with local councils and schools to cut absence .
it says efforts to tackle the problem are starting to have an impact .
the nao says the department for education and skills has spent £ 885m on schemes to tackle absences since 1997 .
a further £ 560m is ear-marked to be spent on dealing with the problem in 2005 and 2006 .
since 1997 , the overall rate of absence , which includes authorised absences for illness or family holidays as well as truancy , has fallen from 7.6 % to 6.7 % of school days .
that means about 450,000 of england 's 6.7 million state school pupils are missing school each day .
about 50,000 of these are playing truant .
nao school attendance report in full -lrb- 977kb -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
the nao 's report said : " attendance needs to be managed because , while absent , young people are not benefiting from education to the value of £ 1.6bn each year .
" pupils with high absence rates are much more likely to leave school with few or no qualifications and they are more at risk of being drawn into undesirable activities , including crime and anti-social behaviour . "
' making progress ' however , education secretary ruth kelly told the bbc radio four 's today programme the government was making progress . "
we are starting to have an impact " education secretary ruth kelly " i think this government is actually the first government ever to take this problem seriously and we are starting to have an impact , " she said .
but she accepted there was a " hard core of persistent truants " , who represent around 2 % of the country 's 6.7m pupils .
" we really need , somehow , to get to grips with those persistent truants , " she said .
ms kelly said the main thing the government had done was to give local authorities the power to tackle this problem .
the government would soon be unveiling plans for more vocational training for pupils turned off by the existing curriculum .
it wants to reduce the overall absence rate to 6.28 % by 2008 .
prosecution the nao called for more efforts to be directed at primary school level , to stop children developing bad habits of skipping school .
parents ' negative attitudes to education also needed to be challenged .
early indications were that schemes designed to tackle poor attendance were having an effect .
have your say " it seems that throwing money at a problem will not make it go away " oliver , uk send us your comments it assessed various projects , including the increased use of prosecution -lrb- some evidence that it is a deterrent -rrb- and a fixed penalty scheme , whereby the parents of truants can be fined £ 100 -lrb- too early to say -rrb- .
under a scheme called the behaviour improvement programme - where problems of behaviour and truancy are tackled together - overall absence rates at schools involved fell twice as fast as the national rates .
' fear of bullying ' but the shadow education secretary , tim collins , called it a " devastating independent report " .
" we have to put this in context : the government is spending an awful lot of money and not getting a lot for it , " he said .
he said all the government had succeeded in doing was reducing the number of authorised absences , such as where a parent gains permission for a child to go on a holiday .
" but they had made no progress at all ... in reducing unauthorised absence which is what we should all be worried about , which is truancy , " he said .
fear of bullying was one main " driving force " behind truancy and the conservatives aimed to fight this by " cracking down on indiscipline in schools " .
providing alternative vocational training for 14 and 15-year-olds was another important move .
the liberal democrats ' education spokesman , phil willis , said : " seven years of tough government rhetoric and meaningless targets have done nothing to tackle the truancy epidemic in our schools . "
it was time to tackle the causes of truancy rather than focus on penalties .
what was needed were smaller class sizes that gave teachers more time with each pupil , better flexibility between academic and vocational courses and reforming the curriculum so young people saw school as relevant .

since 1997 , the overall rate of absence , which includes authorised absences for illness or family holidays as well as truancy , has fallen from 7.6 % to 6.7 % of school days .

the nao says the department for education and skills has spent £ 885m on schemes to tackle absences since 1997 .
a further £ 560m is ear-marked to be spent on dealing with the problem in 2005 and 2006 .
since 1997 , the overall rate of absence , which includes authorised absences for illness or family holidays as well as truancy , has fallen from 7.6 % to 6.7 % of school days .
