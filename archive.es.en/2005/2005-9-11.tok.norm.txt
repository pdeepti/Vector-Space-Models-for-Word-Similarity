while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.09.2005 chinese medicine gaining popularity back to first page back 2/2 personal prescription each patient is different , so the initial examination , involving discussing the symptoms and patients ' lifestyles as well as examining their tongues and how they walk , helps to determine the treatment plan , lü explained .
in weimann 's case , he experienced major relief after his first treatment , but lü warned that it would take a while to get rid of the pain completely .
" it was never as bad as it was before , " weimann said .
after about seven treatments involving acupuncture and a circulation-enhancing and detox technique known as " massage cupping , " weimann is convinced of tcm 's effectiveness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massage cupping treatment improves circulation and removes toxins and doctors are responding to their patients ' desires .
dr. heidi rausch , a tcm instructor , said tcm has grown enormously since she became a member of the german doctors ' association for acupuncture in 1985 .
in the last 15 years alone , membership in the organization has grown 10 times and has now reached 11,000 .
likewise , membership in the consortium for classical acupuncture and tcm , which includes non-medical practitioners , has almost doubled in the last six to seven years , according to birgit ziegler , the group 's deputy chairwoman .
covering the costs despite the increased interest , insurance companies are only cautiously embracing tcm .
german health care provider deutsche betriebskrankenkasse expressed doubts about just how popular tcm has become .
" it 's exaggerated , " spokesman rainer brenker said .
" a study in the 1990s found that 5-10 percent of our clientele were interested in alternative healing treatments . "
other insurers are more open , even if the financial coverage is not always available for patients .
" we have limited financial means and what 's optimal for us is what works , " said innungskrankenkasse spokesman joachim odenbach .
ultimately , the decision of whether to pay for tcm treatments is up to the board representing doctors , insurers and patients and it is likely to remain limited in any case .
while insurance coverage is a factor for patients , most , including weimann , whose insurance covers his treatments , " would rather do without something else than have to go around with pain . "
does it work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seeking to evaluate the ability of acupuncture to alleviate chronic pain , german insurance companies funded the so-called gerac studies - the largest scientific investigation of acupuncture ever - which were carried out from 2001-2004 .
the results showed that traditional acupuncture -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- produced better results than western medicine -lrb- 27 percent -rrb- .
but 44 percent of patients given fake acupuncture also reported improvement , thus showing a placebo effect .
for those helped by tcm , like weimann , the study results have little relevance .
" even if it is just a placebo , it still works , " weimann said . megan harris , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : homeopathy no better than placebo homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : political parties : on the campaign trail color of money and not of trees conservatives unveil election platform liberals becoming neo-liberal ?
spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
" it 's still an open race " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
" it 's still an open race " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .

for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .
18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet . " even if there is a change in government , it is unlikely to result in a big reform push , " said morgan stanley economist elga bartsch .
basically , the spd " is sticking to the status quo " while the cdu was " essentially proposing a continuation of the gradual reform process started by schröder , " bartsch said . as a result , the economist saw " no compelling reason " to re-assess her growth forecast for germany , even if merkel were to win .
the cdu 's proposals " still do n't fully address the challenges facing the german economy in an increasingly integrated global economy , " bartsch criticized . cdu wants to raise taxes one of the more controversial points in merkel 's manifesto is a proposal to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by two points to 18 percent in order to help finance a reduction in the unemployment insurance employers are obliged to pay for their staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such a move would help bring down germany 's notoriously high non-wage labor costs .
but it could also backfire by choking off chronically weak consumer demand and , further down the line , trigger a similar sort of political backlash that looks likely to topple schröder next weekend . another policy centerpiece of a merkel government would be a revamp of the tax system .
the man tipped to become her finance minister , ext week , there is no guarantee that merkel and her cdu will be any more successful than schröder was in persuading a reluctant population to swallow the bitter pill of painful but vital economic reforms . a deep political cynicism has taken root in germany , according to ruediger schmitt-beck , a political science professor at the university of duisburg-essen .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
" it 's still an open race " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .

" to organize and host the 2006 world cup in such a way that most people would agree that , ' germany did it right ' - that would be the best compliment for us .
it also would be nice if we meet brazil finals on july 9th in berlin to have a little revenge for what they put us through in yokohama in 2002 ! " lazy or lighting-quick ? bildunterschrift : growing up in the streets and parks of an industrial section of munich , it became clear early on that young franz would become a good player . still , none of his early coaches or teammates would ever have guessed that the young bavarian would become one of the most popular german soccer players in history . like bobby moore , franz had a particular gift : he never needed to look swift - even though he could be lightning-quick - because his mind was usually two or even three moves ahead of the rest . " they used to point fingers at me and say " look at that lazy dog , he 's not following the ball . " but if i see that the ball is going 30-meters out of bounds then , why should i bother running when it is quite obviously going out . but , at that time , it was like you had to follow the ball . the crowd would n't cheer unless you ran all the way into the out-of-bounds .
well … that just was n't in my repertoire . " setting the stage over the years franz has acquired almost every honor there is in the sport of soccer - five-time german champion , four-time european cup champion , as well as world cup campion in 1974 as a player and 1990 as coach . but it is not just for the medals and trophies that beckenbauer is remembered .
he started a revolution in his own right by inventing the role of the attacking sweeper or libero .
those long runs out of central midfield had never been seen before .
up to then , no one had thought that a sweeper had any business being in his opponents ' half of the field , let alone scoring . bildunterschrift : many would consider beckenbauer to be germany 's " player of the century . " few could move with the ball like him .
the 1970s were his years , playing on the national team and with bayern munich , he presented the world with a flashy , sometimes arrogant image of german soccer that still resonates decades later . life begins at sixty these days beckenbaur is regarded as much more then just a great ' player . ' he coached the german national team to the 1990 world cup chamption finals against argentina .
he has served as club president of fc bayern , the most successful team in the german bundesliga . likewise , in his current role as president of the fifa world cup organizing committee , franz was instrumental in bringing the world cup to germany in 2006 , an act which solidified his reputation as the luminary behind modern german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asked about what he wants to do after the world cup , franz usually dodges the question .
" we 'll see , " he says .
lately he has made suggestions that he would like to take over as head of uefa when lennart johansson is forced to retire in 2007 . one thing 's for sure : even as the kaiser of german soccer ages , the world around him seems to reach out to him and keep him from fading into the background . " the future is never certain , i prefer to leave that to other people .
sometime i will have to retire for real and when i do i hope that everything i have done meets the standard people expect of me , " he said .
" i do n't want to leave any hard feelings out there . i 'd be happy if most people could think ' hey , the guy managed to do a pretty good job , and he 's not such a bad fellow after all .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : political parties : on the campaign trail color of money and not of trees conservatives unveil election platform liberals becoming neo-liberal ?
spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .

are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .

you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

" to organize and host the 2006 world cup in such a way that most people would agree that , ' germany did it right ' - that would be the best compliment for us .
it also would be nice if we meet brazil finals on july 9th in berlin to have a little revenge for what they put us through in yokohama in 2002 ! " lazy or lighting-quick ? bildunterschrift : growing up in the streets and parks of an industrial section of munich , it became clear early on that young franz would become a good player . still , none of his early coaches or teammates would ever have guessed that the young bavarian would become one of the most popular german soccer players in history . like bobby moore , franz had a particular gift : he never needed to look swift - even though he could be lightning-quick - because his mind was usually two or even three moves ahead of the rest . " they used to point fingers at me and say " look at that lazy dog , he 's not following the ball . " but if i see that the ball is going 30-meters out of bounds then , why should i bother running when it is quite obviously going out . but , at that time , it was like you had to follow the ball . the crowd would n't cheer unless you ran all the way into the out-of-bounds .
well … that just was n't in my repertoire . " setting the stage over the years franz has acquired almost every honor there is in the sport of soccer - five-time german champion , four-time european cup champion , as well as world cup campion in 1974 as a player and 1990 as coach . but it is not just for the medals and trophies that beckenbauer is remembered .
he started a revolution in his own right by inventing the role of the attacking sweeper or libero .
those long runs out of central midfield had never been seen before .
up to then , no one had thought that a sweeper had any business being in his opponents ' half of the field , let alone scoring . bildunterschrift : many would consider beckenbauer to be germany 's " player of the century . " few could move with the ball like him .
the 1970s were his years , playing on the national team and with bayern munich , he presented the world with a flashy , sometimes arrogant image of german soccer that still resonates decades later . life begins at sixty these days beckenbaur is regarded as much more then just a great ' player . ' he coached the german national team to the 1990 world cup chamption finals against argentina .
he has served as club president of fc bayern , the most successful team in the german bundesliga . likewise , in his current role as president of the fifa world cup organizing committee , franz was instrumental in bringing the world cup to germany in 2006 , an act which solidified his reputation as the luminary behind modern german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asked about what he wants to do after the world cup , franz usually dodges the question .
" we 'll see , " he says .
lately he has made suggestions that he would like to take over as head of uefa when lennart johansson is forced to retire in 2007 . one thing 's for sure : even as the kaiser of german soccer ages , the world around him seems to reach out to him and keep him from fading into the background . " the future is never certain , i prefer to leave that to other people .
sometime i will have to retire for real and when i do i hope that everything i have done meets the standard people expect of me , " he said .
" i do n't want to leave any hard feelings out there . i 'd be happy if most people could think ' hey , the guy managed to do a pretty good job , and he 's not such a bad fellow after all .

in weimann 's case , he experienced major relief after his first treatment , but lü warned that it would take a while to get rid of the pain completely .
" it was never as bad as it was before , " weimann said .
after about seven treatments involving acupuncture and a circulation-enhancing and detox technique known as " massage cupping , " weimann is convinced of tcm 's effectiveness .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet .

the cdu 's proposals " still do n't fully address the challenges facing the german economy in an increasingly integrated global economy , " bartsch criticized . cdu wants to raise taxes one of the more controversial points in merkel 's manifesto is a proposal to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by two points to 18 percent in order to help finance a reduction in the unemployment insurance employers are obliged to pay for their staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such a move would help bring down germany 's notoriously high non-wage labor costs .
but it could also backfire by choking off chronically weak consumer demand and , further down the line , trigger a similar sort of political backlash that looks likely to topple schröder next weekend . another policy centerpiece of a merkel government would be a revamp of the tax system .

for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .
18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet . " even if there is a change in government , it is unlikely to result in a big reform push , " said morgan stanley economist elga bartsch .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .
" it 's still an open race " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .

for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .
18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet . " even if there is a change in government , it is unlikely to result in a big reform push , " said morgan stanley economist elga bartsch .
basically , the spd " is sticking to the status quo " while the cdu was " essentially proposing a continuation of the gradual reform process started by schröder , " bartsch said . as a result , the economist saw " no compelling reason " to re-assess her growth forecast for germany , even if merkel were to win .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .
18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet . " even if there is a change in government , it is unlikely to result in a big reform push , " said morgan stanley economist elga bartsch .
basically , the spd " is sticking to the status quo " while the cdu was " essentially proposing a continuation of the gradual reform process started by schröder , " bartsch said . as a result , the economist saw " no compelling reason " to re-assess her growth forecast for germany , even if merkel were to win .
the cdu 's proposals " still do n't fully address the challenges facing the german economy in an increasingly integrated global economy , " bartsch criticized . cdu wants to raise taxes one of the more controversial points in merkel 's manifesto is a proposal to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by two points to 18 percent in order to help finance a reduction in the unemployment insurance employers are obliged to pay for their staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such a move would help bring down germany 's notoriously high non-wage labor costs .
but it could also backfire by choking off chronically weak consumer demand and , further down the line , trigger a similar sort of political backlash that looks likely to topple schröder next weekend . another policy centerpiece of a merkel government would be a revamp of the tax system .
the man tipped to become her finance minister , ext week , there is no guarantee that merkel and her cdu will be any more successful than schröder was in persuading a reluctant population to swallow the bitter pill of painful but vital economic reforms . a deep political cynicism has taken root in germany , according to ruediger schmitt-beck , a political science professor at the university of duisburg-essen . " the belief that all politicians are equally bad is becoming increasingly widespread , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet .

the cdu 's proposals " still do n't fully address the challenges facing the german economy in an increasingly integrated global economy , " bartsch criticized . cdu wants to raise taxes one of the more controversial points in merkel 's manifesto is a proposal to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by two points to 18 percent in order to help finance a reduction in the unemployment insurance employers are obliged to pay for their staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such a move would help bring down germany 's notoriously high non-wage labor costs .
but it could also backfire by choking off chronically weak consumer demand and , further down the line , trigger a similar sort of political backlash that looks likely to topple schröder next weekend . another policy centerpiece of a merkel government would be a revamp of the tax system .
the man tipped to become her finance minister , ext week , there is no guarantee that merkel and her cdu will be any more successful than schröder was in persuading a reluctant population to swallow the bitter pill of painful but vital economic reforms . a deep political cynicism has taken root in germany , according to ruediger schmitt-beck , a political science professor at the university of duisburg-essen .

" they used to point fingers at me and say " look at that lazy dog , he 's not following the ball . " but if i see that the ball is going 30-meters out of bounds then , why should i bother running when it is quite obviously going out . but , at that time , it was like you had to follow the ball . the crowd would n't cheer unless you ran all the way into the out-of-bounds .

he started a revolution in his own right by inventing the role of the attacking sweeper or libero .

the 1970s were his years , playing on the national team and with bayern munich , he presented the world with a flashy , sometimes arrogant image of german soccer that still resonates decades later . life begins at sixty these days beckenbaur is regarded as much more then just a great ' player . ' he coached the german national team to the 1990 world cup chamption finals against argentina .
he has served as club president of fc bayern , the most successful team in the german bundesliga . likewise , in his current role as president of the fifa world cup organizing committee , franz was instrumental in bringing the world cup to germany in 2006 , an act which solidified his reputation as the luminary behind modern german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when asked about what he wants to do after the world cup , franz usually dodges the question .
" we 'll see , " he says .
lately he has made suggestions that he would like to take over as head of uefa when lennart johansson is forced to retire in 2007 . one thing 's for sure : even as the kaiser of german soccer ages , the world around him seems to reach out to him and keep him from fading into the background . " the future is never certain , i prefer to leave that to other people .
sometime i will have to retire for real and when i do i hope that everything i have done meets the standard people expect of me , " he said .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 no miracle cure for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : status quo regardless of whom german voters pick ?
for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .
18 poll . with nearly five million people without a job , the overriding theme of this general election is , of course , unemployment .
but most of those people on the dole do not believe their plight will improve much if there is a change in government , as they fail to detect any major differences in the economic platforms of either chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens or their conservative challengers , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . indeed , while the small-print may differ , the main thrust of the economic manifestos of both parties point very much in the same direction - of additional social and labor market reforms , rather than a reversal of the reforms implemented so far . merkel has sought to capitalize on the government 's poor economic track-record , with unemployment stuck at post-war highs and the economy consistently one of the lowest-performing in the euro zone . both sides to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl and angela merkel germans are a lot worse off now than they were seven years ago when schröder first stormed to power , merkel argues , while schröder retorts that the roots of many of the country 's back-breaking economic problems can be traced back to the previous conservative administration under merkel 's mentor helmut kohl . nevertheless , while merkel is widely tipped to win on the vote , economists believe that she too will shy away from the more radical changes needed to get the economy back on its feet . " even if there is a change in government , it is unlikely to result in a big reform push , " said morgan stanley economist elga bartsch .
basically , the spd " is sticking to the status quo " while the cdu was " essentially proposing a continuation of the gradual reform process started by schröder , " bartsch said . as a result , the economist saw " no compelling reason " to re-assess her growth forecast for germany , even if merkel were to win .
the cdu 's proposals " still do n't fully address the challenges facing the german economy in an increasingly integrated global economy , " bartsch criticized . cdu wants to raise taxes one of the more controversial points in merkel 's manifesto is a proposal to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by two points to 18 percent in order to help finance a reduction in the unemployment insurance employers are obliged to pay for their staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such a move would help bring down germany 's notoriously high non-wage labor costs .
but it could also backfire by choking off chronically weak consumer demand and , further down the line , trigger a similar sort of political backlash that looks likely to topple schröder next weekend . another policy centerpiece of a merkel government would be a revamp of the tax system .
the man tipped to become her finance minister , ext week , there is no guarantee that merkel and her cdu will be any more successful than schröder was in persuading a reluctant population to swallow the bitter pill of painful but vital economic reforms . a deep political cynicism has taken root in germany , according to ruediger schmitt-beck , a political science professor at the university of duisburg-essen .

in weimann 's case , he experienced major relief after his first treatment , but lü warned that it would take a while to get rid of the pain completely .
" it was never as bad as it was before , " weimann said .

dr. heidi rausch , a tcm instructor , said tcm has grown enormously since she became a member of the german doctors ' association for acupuncture in 1985 .
in the last 15 years alone , membership in the organization has grown 10 times and has now reached 11,000 .

ultimately , the decision of whether to pay for tcm treatments is up to the board representing doctors , insurers and patients and it is likely to remain limited in any case .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.09.2005 " change is needed to get germany moving " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would be the first woman and first easterner to lead germany german conservative leader angela merkel is currently favored to become chancellor after the sept .
18 election .
in an interview with dw-tv she discussed her foreign policy plans and comparisons to margaret thatcher . dw-tv : unless the pollsters are completely wrong , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- will win the general election on sept .
18 and you will become the first woman to lead germany .
are you already planning your move into the chancellery ? angela merkel : we will fight until the end since we know the voters will only decide the outcome on election day .
that 's why i wo n't count my chickens before they 're hatched , but we are well prepared to take over the responsibilities of governing . abroad you are often compared to a famous british prime minister .
do you want to be the german margaret thatcher ? i think such comparisons are always a bit off the mark .
margaret thatcher was just as excited about german reunification as i was .
on the other hand , it 's correct that we 're in a phase when germany also needs to undergo further reforms .
that means you can look at the broad success of some of margaret thatcher 's reforms as an example , but overall i 'm me and germany is germany . you spent the first three decades of your life in east germany and came to politics late .
who is your inspiration politically ? i do n't have just one political role model .
clearly i learned the most from helmut kohl , since i served in his cabinet for eight years .
that 's were i experienced my greatest introduction to politics .
and i think the way he shaped german reunification and how he stood for europe as the european union is an example of historic dimensions . bildunterschrift : helmut kohl is a man - which women in politics do you most admire ? unfortunately there are n't that many .
i 've had to deal with the same kinds of hairstyle stories that hillary clinton has and we 've already talked about margaret thatcher .
i 've forged my own way and both men and women have been part of that as role models or people that i admire , but there certainly could be more women . the tax proposals of your designated finance minister , paul kirchhof , are opposed by many members of your own party .
his flat tax rate of 25 percent is thought to upset german sensibilities toward equality and fairness . what should be debated is our election platform .
and paul kirchhof joined my team of advisors because he sees our platform as two thirds of the way to a truly simplified tax system .
now we 'll have our hands full just implementing that and there is plenty of discussion since we 'd get rid of plenty of exceptions with this election platform .
that means we have to take it step by step , thinking about what could come after that is n't forbidden .
paul kirchhof has proposals that go further , but they , of course , would first have to be discussed .
i made him part of my team of advisors because he 's a man that does n't forget the forest by looking at the trees .
sometimes we get so caught up in details that we lose greater vision and that wo n't happen with paul kirchhof . creating new jobs and stirring domestic demand are your economic priorities .
but why raise the value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- when that would instead dampen consumption ? we have to think over in what order we implement various measures .
it 's important for me that jobs have priority and that means we have to halt the process that costs us over 1,000 social-security paying positions each day .
to do that we need a bundle of measure that cut non-wage labor costs , such as lowering unemployment insurance contributions .
and if we do n't want to do that by borrowing - increasing the debt - then the only way is to raise indirect taxes elsewhere .
we are telling people that ahead of the election because we know - or at least i 'm convinced - that this step will create more jobs which will give people the security to start spending again .
you ca n't force people to make purchases , they have to feel confident about the future and the only way i can ensure that is by improving the labor market in germany . bildunterschrift : you have been accused during the campaign of not taking a clear position on the war in iraq .
should germany support the united states in this war ? i have always said that under a conservative-led government there would be no german soldiers in iraq .
during the first gulf war under chancellor helmut kohl there were no german soldiers in iraq and there 's absolutely no reason to change that .
the criticism was about something else .
the criticism started because the chancellor and the government committed themselves very early and in my opinion then weakened the international pressure on saddam hussein that possibly could have meant that we never would have had to have this war .
as it turns out it did .
but i can say to everyone : no german soldiers in iraq . us president bush supports turkey 's bid to join the european union .
you are strongly against it .
the makings of a new transatlantic row ? regarding transatlantic ties , it 's not about always having the same opinion .
that was never the case with germany and the united states of america .
i have indeed a different opinion about turkey 's full membership .
turkey should be bound tightly to europe in security and geo-strategic questions in order to shape foreign policy together .
turkey is a member of nato so that could be easily done .
but the internal market - european integration is rather deep at this point - and i believe the european union would be overwhelmed if turkey were accepted as a full member .
and i think we should we should clearly tell turkey now , instead of in 10 or 15 years , that the public in some european countries , for example france which has referendums , are n't prepared to support its bid .
that would create much greater foreign policy problems , which i 'd like to avoid . as chancellor , would you try to stop accession negotiations or would you simply ensure that such negotiations made membership impossible ? i 'd do what is always done in foreign policy if we get the chance .
that is , pacta sunt servanda , which means the next government would stick to the responsibilities of the preceding government .
if turkey fulfils the requirements , then accession negotiations will start .
they are considered to be without a predetermined outcome so we could then bring our ideas to the negotiating table , naturally .
but they would be in the context of what our predecessors have already agreed to . bildunterschrift : i noticed in the televised debate with the chancellor that you and chancellor schröder overall treated each other fairly and with respect .
does that herald the coming of a so-called grand coalition or is it simply that you do n't really dislike one another ? i do n't think either is the case .
it was just important that such a duel about discussing where germany is going was done in a reasonable format .
but i believe a grand coalition would mean a total standstill , that 's why i 'm fighting for change and a change with the union and fdp -lrb- the free-market liberal free democratic party -rrb- .
such change is needed to get germany moving again .
all other possible political constellations that one can imagine are either inefficient as a grand coalition or weak like red-red-green -lrb- spd , left party , greens -rrb- for example or a so-called traffic light coalition with spd , fdp and greens .
they all would n't bring germany forward a single millimeter and that 's why i tell people : this time vote cdu so we can have true change . merkel was interviewed by dw-tv 's christian trippe send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

while doubts remain and insurers do n't usually pay , patients who 've experienced its healing power are hooked . after his wednesday morning appointment at dr. hung lü 's acupuncture clinic in bonn , thomas weimann grabs his suit jacket and passes an oriental wall tapestry on his way out of the treatment room , while lü prepares for the next patient in her office .
" see you on friday , " he says as he heads to work .
weimann has been receiving treatments for his back and shoulder pain from lü for about two months .
" call it a chinese miracle , i do n't know - my pain disappeared , " he said .
a middle-aged account manager for an auto supplier , weimann had tried various treatments , including massage and pills , to ease his pain , with only partial results .
although his pain decreased with hospital treatments , it never really went away .
frustrated , he searched the internet for alternative medical treatments and discovered traditional chinese medicine -lrb- tcm -rrb- .
weimann made his first appointment without hesitation .
" it was a totally unemotional decision and i was n't afraid , " he said , having been convinced that it would do the trick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the medical traditions common to china are deeply connected to the culture and range from acupunture to herbal and dietary solutions like many in germany , weimann has turned to tcm for the age-old healing powers of acupuncture , herbal remedies , relaxation and detoxification treatments .
tcm is rooted in age-old chinese healing remedies .
lü , whose mother is a doctor in china and who herself has practiced tcm since shortly after coming to germany 18 years ago , said , " it 's an important part of chinese culture . "
importing age-old traditions as the number of patients seeking alternative treatments increases , more and more german doctors are beginning to offer tcm techniques . dr. angela redlich , who runs a tcm practice in berlin and studied tcm in china , said people seek out tcm if other more mainstream methods have n't worked , or if they want something that does n't have side effects .
the most common ailments treated are migraines , bronchitis , aches and pains of the back and joints as well as gastro-intestinal problems .
practitioners sometimes combine acupuncture , herbs and nourishment treatments as well as suggest quigong , a popular type of relaxation exercise .
the duration also varies from one to 20 or more treatments .

" to organize and host the 2006 world cup in such a way that most people would agree that , ' germany did it right ' - that would be the best compliment for us .
it also would be nice if we meet brazil finals on july 9th in berlin to have a little revenge for what they put us through in yokohama in 2002 ! " lazy or lighting-quick ? bildunterschrift : growing up in the streets and parks of an industrial section of munich , it became clear early on that young franz would become a good player . still , none of his early coaches or teammates would ever have guessed that the young bavarian would become one of the most popular german soccer players in history . like bobby moore , franz had a particular gift : he never needed to look swift - even though he could be lightning-quick - because his mind was usually two or even three moves ahead of the rest . " they used to point fingers at me and say " look at that lazy dog , he 's not following the ball . " but if i see that the ball is going 30-meters out of bounds then , why should i bother running when it is quite obviously going out . but , at that time , it was like you had to follow the ball . the crowd would n't cheer unless you ran all the way into the out-of-bounds .
well … that just was n't in my repertoire . " setting the stage over the years franz has acquired almost every honor there is in the sport of soccer - five-time german champion , four-time european cup champion , as well as world cup campion in 1974 as a player and 1990 as coach . but it is not just for the medals and trophies that beckenbauer is remembered .
he started a revolution in his own right by inventing the role of the attacking sweeper or libero .
those long runs out of central midfield had never been seen before .
up to then , no one had thought that a sweeper had any business being in his opponents ' half of the field , let alone scoring . bildunterschrift : many would consider beckenbauer to be germany 's " player of the century . " few could move with the ball like him .

the prince said modern life had got out of balance , and needed to return to the rhythms of nature .
he also revealed he used to sing to seals as a child with his grandmother near her highland home .

i think it 's terribly important for any human being to have a time for silence prince charles " one of the things that is so special to me is the connection with my grandmother , " he said .

the special edition of the programme was filmed in caithness and the interview held in the castle of mey , the late queen mother 's beloved home .
he reflected on the sanctuary caithness offered in a frenetic world .
" i just think we need to remember we are a part of nature and not apart from it , which i think has been one of the great problems of the twentieth century , " he said .

police said cars were hijacked and roads blocked in ballyclare , glengormley , rathcoole , larne and carrickfergus .
dup leader ian paisley blamed the parades commission for not reviewing the route that barred it from a nationalist area .
the parade was re-routed to avoid the mainly nationalist springfield road area .
after a request by unionists on friday , the parades commission reviewed its ruling on the route , but decided not to change it .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- inside the hurricane zone bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 11 september 2005 , 06:02 gmt 07:02 uk inside the hurricane zone bbc news website reporter richard allen greene is travelling through the stricken neighbourhoods of new orleans .
here he shares his experience of the journey and the people he met along the way .
gulfport , mississippi : saturday , 10 september , 1700gmt americans believe very deeply in two things : business and god .
stopping back in gulfport on my way home , i saw plenty of evidence of the former .
there is still a lot of military traffic , but the city is clearly open for business , less than two weeks after hurricane katrina .
shops and restaurants proudly displayed " we 're open " signs , even as blue tarpaulins were being fastened onto the remains of their roofs .
the area near the beachfront is technically a closed police zone , but even past the barricades at least two shops were open - a pawnshop and another selling blue jeans .
heavy lifting equipment was clearing away massive rubble around the casinos , including the broken remains of lorries .
meanwhile , new ones were already rolling through town to replace them .
and on highway 49 , just as you pull into town , cliff dann and paul clark have set up by the side of the road to sell generators and mobile homes .
they drove in from florida a day after the storm , cliff says , and have sold more than 300 generators so far .
no matter what happens , it seems , americans will dust themselves off and get back to business .
-lrb- in fact , i saw my first " i survived the big one - hurricane katrina " t-shirts today . -rrb-
but they will also ask themselves why such tragedies happen .
deeply religious , they ask where god was when the winds blew .
for some , it seems , nothing can shake their faith .
col joe spraggins is the head of emergency operations in harrison county , which includes gulfport and biloxi .
for days after the storm , he gave twice-daily briefings about how recovery was progressing .
but once , he looked up from his facts and figures and maps to address the broader picture .
" for so many years , " he said , " we 've had everything so easy , so perfect .
when god gives us a disaster , we have to find out why .
it might be to bring us back to reality . "
baton rouge : friday , 9 september , 1600gmt who is to blame ?
it 's a very human response to a catastrophe like the bungled rescue operation following hurricane katrina .
but it 's also an ugly one , driven partly by the intense partisan mood in the united states .
president bush is a republican .
louisiana governor kathleen blanco and senator mary landrieu are democrats .
nationally , much of the anger has focused on national organisations , like the federal emergency management agency -lrb- fema -rrb- , or on president bush himself , who was seen golfing the day after the storm hit .
but here in baton rouge , the louisiana state capital , a talk radio host is venting his fury at gov blanco , who , he says , blocked federal relief from coming in and refused to hand control of the state 's national guard to the president .
" when is she going to stand up in front of the microphones and answer some questions ?
i 'm not blaming her , " he adds , entirely disingenuously .
" i just want some answers . "
but like a tropical storm at sea , he changes directions unexpectedly and demands that his producer phone fema 's emergency help line to see what kind of response evacuees receive - if any .
there is plenty of blame to go around , he concludes .
shortly after his rant - and entirely unrelated to it , i would imagine - fema director mike brown is relieved of his responsibility for katrina relief .
a first sign , perhaps , of the first head to roll .
bogalusa , louisiana : thursday , 8 september , 1700gmt louisiana state highway 21 must have been an extraordinarily beautiful drive two weeks ago - in fact , it 's officially labelled one of the state 's " scenic byways " .
it winds its way north through dense forest , traditional mailboxes on posts by the side of the road marking the houses in the wood .
but it 's hard to see the forest , for the trees that have been snapped in two draw the eye .
like vandalism that says " katrina was here " , the firs are splintered , lying at jazzy angles , fallen on houses , suspended from downed power lines .
crews have cleared the road and are industriously sawing up the remains of the trees into wood that can be hauled away , but it still looks like the forest has a long , gaping wound .
don brussard , a volunteer who drove from baton rouge to bogalusa to hand out free hot meals , says he was amazed at the damage .
and joshua bridges , 84 , who lives in bogalusa , has seen similar destruction around his own home : " trees you could n't get your arms around have been torn down . "
baton rouge : thursday 1340gmt visiting a maternity ward at a hospital here , i met a new mother who was distraught at having been separated from her three older children .
she was deeply confused , thinking they were still in the new orleans superdome , even though it was finally completely evacuated several days ago .
so i take something else she says with a pinch of salt : that she was left under the bridge near the superdome for three days , heavily pregnant , because rescuers saved elderly and disabled people first .
whether what she said is entirely accurate seems almost beside the point .
people were left there far longer than they should have been , and a norwegian journalist who has been in the city since before the storm is enraged about it .
" we could get in and out by boat - why could n't the government ? " he demanded as we left the new mother 's room .
" it 's a scandal . "
it is a question even children are asking .
one of my colleagues from newsround , the bbc 's children 's news programme , took questions from her audience after reporting from new orleans for several days .
" how could you get in and out ?
why do you have food and water and petrol ? " one of the young people wanted to know .
the answer , of course , is that when push comes to shove , the bbc has the funds to get these things .
but large an organisation as it is , the bbc is a molehill compared to the mountain that is the us government .
congress and george w bush are both setting up inquiries into what went wrong .
the children who watch newsround will be looking forward to an answer .
baton rouge : wednesday , 7 september , 2030gmt do n't call mary ann mercier and her husband eric " refugees " .
like a lot of people who fled hurricane katrina , they bristle at the term .
" it 's inappropriate , " mary ann , a science teacher , says firmly .
" we were not part of a combat . "
" we were victims of a catastrophe , " eric adds .
the two of them got out of their home in east new orleans before the storm .
they are planning to stay " as long as it takes the city to dry out " - mary ann is looking into working in the local school district for a while - but then they plan to go back to new orleans .
in the meantime , they are amused by at least one aspect of their situation - staying with their son , who is studying nursing at louisiana state university .
" the kids are taking care of us , " eric says .
" it 's payback time . "
baton rouge : wednesday 1440gmt when the radio announcer switched to french , i did a double-take .
what is going on here ?
there must still be french speakers in the bayou , i thought , even 202 years after napoleon sold this land to the united states to raise money for wars against the english .
then i realised - even with my non-existent french - what i was hearing .
it was a plea for foreign nationals evacuated from new orleans to contact the french consulate .
later , the announcement was repeated in spanish , with a number for the mexican consulate .
it 's not only the people of new orleans itself who are frantic about their loved ones , or even only americans .
all around the world , families are still holding their breath , hoping against hope their loved ones got out alive .
baton rouge : tuesday , 6 september , 2200gmt i am getting used to the four-hour drive it takes to get 70 miles from baton rouge to new orleans , but the return journey has always been a breeze .
until today .
today , it took just as long to get into baton rouge as it did to get into new orleans .
going into the big easy , the problem is roadblocks .
going into the state capital , it is gridlock .
evacuees - they hate being called refugees , apparently - have reportedly doubled the size of the population here .
with tuesday being the first day of the new school year and the first day back to work after a long weekend , traffic was out of control .
people will certainly not be allowed back into new orleans for at least a month , so those who have fled here seem likely to stay here .
baton rouge was publicly proud of having taken in so many people , as well it should be .
but crime is reportedly on the rise .
traffic may soon be the least of the problems here .
the french quarter , new orleans : tuesday 1715gmt new orleans has turned a corner .
yes , emergency boats are still out combing the water-logged streets for survivors , and yes , it will be weeks before the city is dry enough for anyone even to know what can be saved and what will have to be bulldozed .
but the army is out in force and looting seems to be in precipitous decline - and today one of the city 's main canals was repaired .
mayor ray nagin said after a helicopter tour that perhaps only 60 % of the city was flooded , down from 80 % at the worst point .
so while this may quite not be the beginning of the crescent city 's recovery , it feels like - as winston churchill might have said - the beginning of the beginning .
but even once repair and reconstruction begin in earnest , more suffering awaits those caught up in hurricane katrina .
i have reported on post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , the mental trauma often experienced by survivors of horrifying experiences .
and while i hate to think of everything as a nail merely because i have a hammer , i am already seeing the signs of ptsd among people i talk to .
perhaps the five-year veteran of the new orleans police who spoke to me in the french quarter always had that intense nervous energy .
perhaps his eyes always darted around as he conversed with people .
or perhaps he has been traumatised by having spent a week at the superdome , where refugees from the storm were trapped in what everyone agrees was a living hell .
law enforcement officials and national guard troops - who were there to maintain order - instead set up camp and huddled in a corner for their own protection , he said .
" it was too hot to sleep in the day and too dangerous to sleep at night , " a colleague of his piped up .
and the storm itself made an incredible impression on the officer , whom i wo n't name because he was not supposed to speak to the press .
" i ca n't even gauge the speed of the wind , but i was looking out the window of the superdome and everything was going sideways .
" i 'm not afraid of anything , " he said .
" and i was terrified . "
saint charles parish , north east of new orleans : tuesday 1315gmt a huge oil refinery sprawls out in both directions from the road into new orleans .
oil is as important an industry on this gulf coast as it is in the more famous gulf in the middle east .
some experts fear that the needs of the oil industry may have inadvertently robbed new orleans of protection from the storm surge that turned the city from amsterdam into venice .
new orleans lies at the mouth of the mississippi river , north america 's mightiest river system .
from time immemorial , the river has been depositing silt in the mississippi delta , creating a buffer zone between the city and the gulf of mexico .
but man has insisted on controlling the mississippi for the convenience of business and industry .
engineers have dammed and lined the river to keep it tamed , severely reducing the size of the delta in the process .
so when katrina hit , new orleans had little protection from one of the greatest storm surges america has ever seen .
today , engineers are starting to pump out the water that storm surge deposited .
engineering helping to repair the damage that engineering caused .
experts are pleading with government and business to think seriously before new orleans embarks on its next major engineering project - rebuilding itself after the storm .
highway 61 north , heading to baton rouge : monday , 5 september , 1530gmt i did n't make it into new orleans today - i was distracted by a family on a rescue mission and lost my place in the queue .
after parting with the family , i headed back north to baton rouge , revisiting highway 61 . "
i checked the odometer ... and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long " only then did i get an idea of the magnitude of traffic trying to get into new orleans on this , the first day people are being let back into part of the city to inspect their homes .
it was clear there was no way i would be able to count the cars on the road , so i checked the odometer instead - and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long .
and there were more cars backed up at a checkpoint further up the road - a three-mile queue .
i regret not getting into new orleans today - but more importantly , i hope everyone sweltering in their cars does .
highway 61 south , en route to new orleans : monday 1320gmt the rumours and speculation i have been hearing are correct .
people are abandoning new orleans for good .
as cars inched their way towards the city , i talked to jerry goff , 58 , who retired two years ago after 33 years working in oil refinery .
he and his wife shelly left their house in marrero on the west bank of the mississippi on sunday , before the storm hit , and took shelter with his parents in alexandria , central louisiana .
they watched on tv as the storm battered their home town .
" it was bad .
real bad , " jerry says .
their house was three feet deep in water , shelley 's brother told them before leaving the city himself on thursday .
they 're going to have a look for themselves today , jerry says , but then they 're going back to alexandria - where he is enrolling his three children in a local school .
gonzales , louisiana : monday 1120gmt today is the labor day holiday in the us , traditionally one of the busiest driving weekends of the year .
in fact , there 's an old joke : if all the cars in america were lined up end-to-end , it would probably be labor day .
the main highway from baton rouge into new orleans surpasses the stereotype this morning .
this is my second morning driving into the city as dawn breaks , and today the traffic is even worse than yesterday .
emergency vehicles scream their way south - police cars , ambulances , hazardous material disposal teams , and pick-up truck after truck hauling small boats with outboard motors to search the still-flooded areas of the city .
yesterday there was another type of rescue vehicle on the road as well , america 's famous snub-nosed yellow school bus .
a queue of them at least a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- long trundled towards new orleans from houston , texas , to bring survivors out of the city .
but today there 's extra traffic as well .
monday is the first day residents of some areas of new orleans are officially permitted back to check their property .
they are allowed to be in the city from 6am to 6pm local time , and many obviously got on the road as early as possible .
they 've waited a full week since the storm hit - and with traffic moving at this pace , they will have to wait at least several hours longer .
the flooded streets of new orleans : sunday , 4 september , 1600gmt at this point , many of the people still in flooded sections of new orleans are there because they refuse to leave .
quite a few , it seems , want to stay behind to care for pets .
ron henry and robyn mooney are volunteers who have been carrying out boat rescues for the past two days .
yesterday , they said , they found a guy hiding in his house with his two dobermans .
determined to get him out , they went so far as to threaten to shoot the dogs - but in the end , on advice from their command post , they let him be .
" it was n't worth getting into a gunfight over it , " robyn said .
and in fact , although ron and robyn have been shouting at people that they have to leave or the police will come and take them away in handcuffs due to the mandatory evacuation order , many of the people they found on their first run today insisted on staying behind .
judy winkel 's street is chest-deep in water , but her front porch is dry , and from it she defiantly told ron and robyn she was staying with her four dogs .
she said her husband was out getting water , and sure enough , darren engeron paddled up in a canoe a moment later .
he too insisted he was staying : " i 'm a survivor , " he said .
" i will find water . "
it became clear that ron and robyn could not convince them to leave , so in a parting gesture , they gave judy and darren some advice on how to avoid the patrols .
" take all this stuff off your front porch .
the rescue teams look for clothes drying outside , " robyn said as ron gunned the air boat 's noisy engine to full power .
a few streets away , the people gathered on bernard topping 's front porch were having what looked like a regular sunday-morning chat in the sunshine .
true , the porch was only an inch or two above the waterline , but no-one seemed to mind - except , perhaps , for william branch .
he wanted to know how things were in the nearby town of lake charles .
" fine , " said robyn .
" they did n't get hit at all . "
william was relieved : his wife and grandchildren were there , he said .
ron and robyn were keen for him to get on board so he could join them , and he wavered for a moment , but ultimately decided to stay .
the folks he was with seemed happy to be where they were - bernard snapped pictures of the rescue boat , while ron chatted with a man on the porch about his boat 's engine .
but when we met up with al coffee at the end of the rescue run , he told a story that put me in mind of william branch and his family in lake charles .
al had found a couple of guys who did n't want to leave .
he found out they both had daughters , so his crew phoned them from their boat so they could plead with the men to ride out .
one refused , even with his daughter screaming at him down the line from florida , but the other one gave in to his daughter 's entreaties from houston .
calling william 's wife in lake charles never occurred to me .
i ca n't help but wonder what would have happened if it had .
jefferson parish , louisiana : sunday 1250gmt the sunrise over lake pontchartrain was beautiful but it revealed my first sight of the devastation hurricane katrina had wrought on new orleans .
i was travelling with al coffee , a retired restaurateur who has been doing voluntary rescue with his own boat , petrol and food for the past week .
before he talked his way through a police road block to get us into the city he mentioned that the 82nd airborne had been sent into new orleans , to help restore order .
the 82nd are among the most hardened infantry troops in the us army .
they were at the forefront of the invasion of iraq and al coffee is livid that they have been sent to new orleans .
al himself served in the national guard and helped with rescue operations after hurricane camille in 1969 .
he thinks public-order operations like this one should be the responsibility of the louisiana national guard .
but the national guard is in iraq .
baton rouge , louisiana : sunday 0200gmt it was with a curious and very unexpected reluctance that i drove west out of gulfport towards new orleans this afternoon .
i ca n't help but agree with a colleague that " the new orleans story " is overshadowing " the mississippi story " .
the horror of what is happening in new orleans is undeniable , with its flooding , fires and lawlessness .
-lrb- when disease sets in , as it undoubtedly will soon , the big easy will have its fourth horseman . -rrb-
new orleans holds a special place in this country 's heart , having given birth to the now-universal cajun-style cooking , glorious jazz , and the curious french-inflected accent which all americans think they can mimic , though none really can .
if most americans think of mississippi at all , they probably think of the 1960s racist murders that inspired the film mississippi burning .
it 's one of the country 's poorest states , with a per capita income two-thirds that of the nation as a whole .
only one in six mississippians has a university degree , while one in four americans does .
and it is about one-third black , giving it the highest percentage of african-americans of any state in the us .
it depends heavily on casinos and oil , both industries smashed by katrina .
-lrb- oil will recover quickly . -rrb-
looking out at the wreckage of gulfport 's shoreline , i wondered how long it would take to clean up - and how long it would have taken to clean up had it been , say , one of the wealthy retirement communities in florida .
but drive to baton rouge i did , and was stunned at what i found here : not only electricity and running water , but joggers striding past neatly trimmed lawns .
in two hours i have driven from a war zone to suburban america .
tomorrow i head into the big easy .
gulfport : saturday , 3 september , 2000gmt harrison county 's emergency operations center is becoming more shipshape by the minute - a generator is running power to the building , the outback restaurant has set up a huge grill and is handing out hamburgers and chicken , and men wearing orange harrison county inmate worker t-shirts are busily mopping the floors .
the " inmate workers " are prisoners from the local jail who are helping with disaster relief .
one of the local sheriff 's deputies told me they were volunteers .
better to be out in the fresh air than locked up inside , he said , but clammed up when i asked more questions .
a moment later , inmate worker steve duke confirmed that he had indeed chosen to help out .
the inmates get time off their sentences for doing community service labour , he said - 30 days ' reduction in sentence for 30 days ' work is the normal trade , but the prisoners are getting unspecified " executive pay " for the disaster relief effort .
but duke was not working to get time off his sentence , he said - he has only 29 days left to serve .
he was doing it because , as he said , " i live here too . "
highway 10 west , mississippi : saturday 1700gmt driving west to see the destruction in bay st louis , a small town near mississippi 's border with louisiana , i picked up a new orleans radio station playing jazz .
not just any old jazz , either , but when the saints go marching in - the signature tune of new orleans jazz - with wailing , screaming horns walking a tightrope between maniacal laughter and uncontrollable tears .
my first thought was that it could be meant as a welcome to the troops who have finally arrived to try to impose some order on the chaotic city .
but listening to those trumpets , i wondered if it was n't a more fundamental cri de coeur , a cry from the heart of the descendants of the original jazzmen who turned their own sorrow , pain and suffering into america 's native music .
gulfport : saturday 1530gmt amid all the destruction of lives , homes , infrastructure and businesses in rural mississippi , some people still have the energy to lament something else katrina took away : the state 's heritage .
kelly robinson , a public information officer with the mississippi emergency management agency , reminded me today that the beachfront was until this week lined with dozens of grand antebellum mansions .
" these were 150-to-200-year-old homes .
these old mansions are just gone , nothing left of them but the base . "
oak trees hundreds of years old have been uprooted as well , " plucked like a tulip would be , " she said .
it is not clear that all of the region 's residents will mourn one of the state 's most significant historic sites - the home of jefferson davis , the first and last president of the confederate states of america , which fought the north in the us civil war .
" the slave quarters are gone , " ms robinson said .
" the carriage is lying in a heap of rubble .
it will be a miracle if the house itself is not destroyed .
it 's still standing , but it wo n't be repaired .
" history is gone , " she said .
" history has destroyed history . "
gulfport : saturday 1400gmt for all the talk of help on the way , nothing has changed on the beachfront at gulfport since the storm hit five days ago .
huge lorries meant to haul tropical fruit lie where the storm left them - upturned , worse than useless , now merely rubble to be hauled away themselves .
and there is more dangerous waste lying on the beach - 40 tons of chicken and a million pounds of shrimp had been sitting in containers on the beach when katrina hit .
they are now scattered across the beachfront , rotting where they lay , a health hazard producing an awful stink .
and they are nearly unrecognisable - though i had been told where to find them , i walked past several before i realised what i was seeing .
my nose found them before my eyes did .
but by far the most unbearable smell comes from a seal , lying on its side and putrefying outside the salmon-coloured copa casino .
there are more humble reminders here , too , of the lives lost and destroyed - a wheelchair sitting abandoned , a videotape of the big bad wolf , the fate of the child who owned it unknown .
biloxi : friday , 2 september , 2330gmt heading back into biloxi to find out what people thought of president bush 's visit today , i saw a fierce sign in front of a house that had been chopped completely in two by a falling tree : you loot ' n ' we shoot .
i wanted to get a picture , but i was n't going to start shooting without permission , so i cautiously pulled into the driveway next door .
as i stepped out of the car , the man in front of the sign turned and reached into his pickup truck .
i decided a slow , cautious approach would be safer than turning my back , and as luck would have it , when the guy turned back to me , his hands were empty and he was smiling .
i introduced myself and asked if i could take a photo of the sign .
sure , the guy said , my son made it .
but just as i was pulling out my camera , an angry voice behind me called : " hey !
whose truck is this in my driveway ? "
i admitted it was mine and said i 'd only be there for a minute while i took a picture .
" well park it in his driveway ! " she shouted .
" i 'm not telling you to move it - i 'm calling the police ! "
i grabbed a quick shot - for which the man i 'd considered threatening made a peace sign - then scurried back to my vehicle to escape the wrath of the neighbour who turned out to be much fiercer .
i made my way down to the beachfront , where i met a construction worker called ed hess .
deeply tanned , with greying hair reaching down towards his shoulders , he could not have been less moved by george bush 's stop in town .
" you really want to impress me ?
come down here and work with me for a day hauling bricks .
i 've been toting water up nine flights of stairs .
if he could keep up with me , that would impress me - otherwise it 's just talk . "
water park , outside gulfport : friday 1750gmt search and rescue has set up a command post at the water park just outside of gulfport , and it is a hive of activity first thing in the morning - highlighting yet another difference between aid workers , who are busy to the point of exhaustion , and those they have come to rescue , who have little to do but sit and wait .
rescue units have come from as far away as pennsylvania and new york city to aid more local ones from alabama and florida .
no-one here admits it , but hopes of finding trapped survivors must be fading .
col joe spraggins , head of the harrison county emergency management agency , says people can last for five to seven days without food or water , but in this heat that must be optimistic .
and today is officially day four after katrina .
col spraggins says three people were rescued on thursday and 17 corpses were discovered .
so far , search and rescue teams are only following tips from the office of emergency operations , not sweeping wide areas .
gulfport , mississippi : friday 1310gmt gulfport , mississippi , is only a short drive from biloxi , but it feels like a different world .
it was clearly poorer to begin with than biloxi , with its once-attractive seafront historic preservation area of century-old homes .
visitors to gulfport , on the other hand , pass a series of pawnshops , discount stores and offers of cash loans with no credit checks .
now , four days after katrina stomped through , it feels like a curious mixture of ghost town and construction , or deconstruction , site .
military police control traffic at intersections , waving the little civilian traffic past non-working traffic lights , while massive earth-moving vehicles roar along the roads at their lumbering , deliberate pace .
again and again , as i pass buildings smashed into firewood , i have to remind myself that this destruction was a random act of nature , because it looks so much like the product of furious anger .
biloxi , mississippi : thursday , 1 september , 2030gmt mother nature ?
i do n't think so : the nature that tore its way through mississippi 's gulf coast at the beginning of the week was more of a giant , petulant child having a particularly nasty tantrum .
downed trees were the first evidence of the intensity of the storm , from the moment i headed out of mobile .
as i headed towards the town of biloxi , they became more frequent - and were joined by damaged billboards and even the occasional carcass lorries that had been hurled aside like children 's discarded toys .
but , as is often the case with freaks of nature , for every twisted , broken wreck of a billboard , there were half a dozen untouched - many , with cruel irony , advertising the big stars due to perform at the casinos that made biloxi a regional entertainment hub .
somehow , i did n't think merle haggard 's show is going to go on as advertised next week , despite his countenance beaming down along highway 10 .
sally lawson , who worked at one of the largest casinos , confirmed my suspicions as soon as i drove along beach boulevard .
friends of hers had been killed trying to ride out the storm , her daughter was due to give birth at any moment , and she had no idea when she would ever get a pay-cheque again .
petrol station , mobile , alabama : thursday 1540gmt london was revelling in an unexpectedly beautiful late-summer day when i left on wednesday - the parks full of sunbathers , the djs joyously playing in the summertime and a lovely day .
but no sooner was i on the plane to atlanta , georgia , than the mood shifted .
" can i borrow your newspaper ? " a flight attendant asked the man in the seat behind me .
he gave her a blank look .
" i 'm from new orleans , " she said .
his demeanour changed immediately : " of course , " he said .
" take it . "
suddenly the strangers on the plane were a community : " i 'm from new orleans , too . "
where ?
where 's your family ?
are they ok ?
yeah , they made it to atlanta .
they 're in houston .
i 'm from florida , i know what you 're going through .
on the ground in mobile , alabama - about an hour from biloxi , mississippi , one of the worst-affected areas - the mood of solidarity prevails .
the woman hiring out cars at the airport is hosting a family whose home was destroyed .
warehouse-like supermarkets proudly hoist banners saying : " we 're open . "
and indeed , although the man next to me as we entered the store wondered aloud if there would be any food , the shelves were stocked and the famous southern charm was much in evidence .
every interaction included a question about how my day was going and a genuine-sounding wish that i have a good one .
and on the roads , the drivers are unfailingly polite in their enormous pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles .
even where i am at the moment - in a long queue for petrol .
the woman at the hire-car agency said her husband had waited three hours for fuel yesterday .
at times like these , i 'm grateful for the southern charm , because it 's 90 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 32c -rrb- at 10am .
it 's going to get hotter and stay hot late into the night , and people seem to sense intuitively that politeness is more important than ever .

here he shares his experience of the journey and the people he met along the way .
gulfport , mississippi : saturday , 10 september , 1700gmt americans believe very deeply in two things : business and god .
stopping back in gulfport on my way home , i saw plenty of evidence of the former .
there is still a lot of military traffic , but the city is clearly open for business , less than two weeks after hurricane katrina .
shops and restaurants proudly displayed " we 're open " signs , even as blue tarpaulins were being fastened onto the remains of their roofs .
generators are much in demand the area near the beachfront is technically a closed police zone , but even past the barricades at least two shops were open - a pawnshop and another selling blue jeans .
heavy lifting equipment was clearing away massive rubble around the casinos , including the broken remains of lorries .
meanwhile , new ones were already rolling through town to replace them .
and on highway 49 , just as you pull into town , cliff dann and paul clark have set up by the side of the road to sell generators and mobile homes .
they drove in from florida a day after the storm , cliff says , and have sold more than 300 generators so far .
no matter what happens , it seems , americans will dust themselves off and get back to business .
-lrb- in fact , i saw my first " i survived the big one - hurricane katrina " t-shirts today . -rrb-
but they will also ask themselves why such tragedies happen .
deeply religious , they ask where god was when the winds blew .
new orleans street preachers made homeless by katrina hand out aid and salvation in pictures for some , it seems , nothing can shake their faith .
col joe spraggins is the head of emergency operations in harrison county , which includes gulfport and biloxi .
for days after the storm , he gave twice-daily briefings about how recovery was progressing .
but once , he looked up from his facts and figures and maps to address the broader picture .
" for so many years , " he said , " we 've had everything so easy , so perfect .
when god gives us a disaster , we have to find out why .
it might be to bring us back to reality . "
baton rouge : friday , 9 september , 1600gmt who is to blame ?
it 's a very human response to a catastrophe like the bungled rescue operation following hurricane katrina .
but it 's also an ugly one , driven partly by the intense partisan mood in the united states .
president bush is a republican .
louisiana governor kathleen blanco and senator mary landrieu are democrats .
nationally , much of the anger has focused on national organisations , like the federal emergency management agency -lrb- fema -rrb- , or on president bush himself , who was seen golfing the day after the storm hit .
but here in baton rouge , the louisiana state capital , a talk radio host is venting his fury at gov blanco , who , he says , blocked federal relief from coming in and refused to hand control of the state 's national guard to the president .
" when is she going to stand up in front of the microphones and answer some questions ?
i 'm not blaming her , " he adds , entirely disingenuously .
" i just want some answers . "
but like a tropical storm at sea , he changes directions unexpectedly and demands that his producer phone fema 's emergency help line to see what kind of response evacuees receive - if any .
there is plenty of blame to go around , he concludes .
shortly after his rant - and entirely unrelated to it , i would imagine - fema director mike brown is relieved of his responsibility for katrina relief .
a first sign , perhaps , of the first head to roll .
bogalusa , louisiana : thursday , 8 september , 1700gmt louisiana state highway 21 must have been an extraordinarily beautiful drive two weeks ago - in fact , it 's officially labelled one of the state 's " scenic byways " .
it winds its way north through dense forest , traditional mailboxes on posts by the side of the road marking the houses in the wood .
highway 21 is lined with trees thrown down by the wind but it 's hard to see the forest , for the trees that have been snapped in two draw the eye .
like vandalism that says " katrina was here " , the firs are splintered , lying at jazzy angles , fallen on houses , suspended from downed power lines .
crews have cleared the road and are industriously sawing up the remains of the trees into wood that can be hauled away , but it still looks like the forest has a long , gaping wound .
don brussard , a volunteer who drove from baton rouge to bogalusa to hand out free hot meals , says he was amazed at the damage .
and joshua bridges , 84 , who lives in bogalusa , has seen similar destruction around his own home : " trees you could n't get your arms around have been torn down . "
baton rouge : thursday 1340gmt visiting a maternity ward at a hospital here , i met a new mother who was distraught at having been separated from her three older children .
she was deeply confused , thinking they were still in the new orleans superdome , even though it was finally completely evacuated several days ago .
so i take something else she says with a pinch of salt : that she was left under the bridge near the superdome for three days , heavily pregnant , because rescuers saved elderly and disabled people first .
whether what she said is entirely accurate seems almost beside the point .
people were left there far longer than they should have been , and a norwegian journalist who has been in the city since before the storm is enraged about it .
" we could get in and out by boat - why could n't the government ? " he demanded as we left the new mother 's room .
" it 's a scandal . "
it is a question even children are asking .
one of my colleagues from newsround , the bbc 's children 's news programme , took questions from her audience after reporting from new orleans for several days .
" how could you get in and out ?
why do you have food and water and petrol ? " one of the young people wanted to know .
the answer , of course , is that when push comes to shove , the bbc has the funds to get these things .
but large an organisation as it is , the bbc is a molehill compared to the mountain that is the us government .
congress and george w bush are both setting up inquiries into what went wrong .
the children who watch newsround will be looking forward to an answer .
baton rouge : wednesday , 7 september , 2030gmt do n't call mary ann mercier and her husband eric " refugees " .
like a lot of people who fled hurricane katrina , they bristle at the term .
the merciers are staying with their son " it 's inappropriate , " mary ann , a science teacher , says firmly .
" we were not part of a combat . "
" we were victims of a catastrophe , " eric adds .
the two of them got out of their home in east new orleans before the storm .
they are planning to stay " as long as it takes the city to dry out " - mary ann is looking into working in the local school district for a while - but then they plan to go back to new orleans .
in the meantime , they are amused by at least one aspect of their situation - staying with their son , who is studying nursing at louisiana state university .
" the kids are taking care of us , " eric says .
" it 's payback time . "
baton rouge : wednesday 1440gmt when the radio announcer switched to french , i did a double-take .
what is going on here ?
there must still be french speakers in the bayou , i thought , even 202 years after napoleon sold this land to the united states to raise money for wars against the english .
then i realised - even with my non-existent french - what i was hearing .
it was a plea for foreign nationals evacuated from new orleans to contact the french consulate .
later , the announcement was repeated in spanish , with a number for the mexican consulate .
it 's not only the people of new orleans itself who are frantic about their loved ones , or even only americans .
all around the world , families are still holding their breath , hoping against hope their loved ones got out alive .
baton rouge : tuesday , 6 september , 2200gmt i am getting used to the four-hour drive it takes to get 70 miles from baton rouge to new orleans , but the return journey has always been a breeze .
until today .
today , it took just as long to get into baton rouge as it did to get into new orleans .
going into the big easy , the problem is roadblocks .
going into the state capital , it is gridlock .
evacuees - they hate being called refugees , apparently - have reportedly doubled the size of the population here .
with tuesday being the first day of the new school year and the first day back to work after a long weekend , traffic was out of control .
people will certainly not be allowed back into new orleans for at least a month , so those who have fled here seem likely to stay here .
baton rouge was publicly proud of having taken in so many people , as well it should be .
but crime is reportedly on the rise .
traffic may soon be the least of the problems here .
the french quarter , new orleans : tuesday 1715gmt new orleans has turned a corner .
yes , emergency boats are still out combing the water-logged streets for survivors , and yes , it will be weeks before the city is dry enough for anyone even to know what can be saved and what will have to be bulldozed .
but the army is out in force and looting seems to be in precipitous decline - and today one of the city 's main canals was repaired .
mayor ray nagin said after a helicopter tour that perhaps only 60 % of the city was flooded , down from 80 % at the worst point .
so while this may quite not be the beginning of the crescent city 's recovery , it feels like - as winston churchill might have said - the beginning of the beginning .
but even once repair and reconstruction begin in earnest , more suffering awaits those caught up in hurricane katrina .
i have reported on post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , the mental trauma often experienced by survivors of horrifying experiences .
and while i hate to think of everything as a nail merely because i have a hammer , i am already seeing the signs of ptsd among people i talk to .
perhaps the five-year veteran of the new orleans police who spoke to me in the french quarter always had that intense nervous energy .
perhaps his eyes always darted around as he conversed with people .
or perhaps he has been traumatised by having spent a week at the superdome , where refugees from the storm were trapped in what everyone agrees was a living hell .
law enforcement officials and national guard troops - who were there to maintain order - instead set up camp and huddled in a corner for their own protection , he said .
" it was too hot to sleep in the day and too dangerous to sleep at night , " a colleague of his piped up .
and the storm itself made an incredible impression on the officer , whom i wo n't name because he was not supposed to speak to the press .
" i ca n't even gauge the speed of the wind , but i was looking out the window of the superdome and everything was going sideways .
" i 'm not afraid of anything , " he said .
" and i was terrified . "
saint charles parish , north east of new orleans : tuesday 1315gmt a huge oil refinery sprawls out in both directions from the road into new orleans .
oil is as important an industry on this gulf coast as it is in the more famous gulf in the middle east .
some experts fear that the needs of the oil industry may have inadvertently robbed new orleans of protection from the storm surge that turned the city from amsterdam into venice .
engineers are hard at work repairing the city 's flood defences new orleans lies at the mouth of the mississippi river , north america 's mightiest river system .
from time immemorial , the river has been depositing silt in the mississippi delta , creating a buffer zone between the city and the gulf of mexico .
but man has insisted on controlling the mississippi for the convenience of business and industry .
engineers have dammed and lined the river to keep it tamed , severely reducing the size of the delta in the process .
so when katrina hit , new orleans had little protection from one of the greatest storm surges america has ever seen .
today , engineers are starting to pump out the water that storm surge deposited .
engineering helping to repair the damage that engineering caused .
experts are pleading with government and business to think seriously before new orleans embarks on its next major engineering project - rebuilding itself after the storm .
highway 61 north , heading to baton rouge : monday , 5 september , 1530gmt i did n't make it into new orleans today - i was distracted by a family on a rescue mission and lost my place in the queue .
after parting with the family , i headed back north to baton rouge , revisiting highway 61 .
i checked the odometer ... and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long only then did i get an idea of the magnitude of traffic trying to get into new orleans on this , the first day people are being let back into part of the city to inspect their homes .
it was clear there was no way i would be able to count the cars on the road , so i checked the odometer instead - and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long .
and there were more cars backed up at a checkpoint further up the road - a three-mile queue .
i regret not getting into new orleans today - but more importantly , i hope everyone sweltering in their cars does .
highway 61 south , en route to new orleans : monday 1320gmt the rumours and speculation i have been hearing are correct .
people are abandoning new orleans for good .
as cars inched their way towards the city , i talked to jerry goff , 58 , who retired two years ago after 33 years working in oil refinery .
jerry goff is moving his family away from new orleans he and his wife shelly left their house in marrero on the west bank of the mississippi on sunday , before the storm hit , and took shelter with his parents in alexandria , central louisiana .
they watched on tv as the storm battered their home town .
" it was bad .
real bad , " jerry says .
their house was three feet deep in water , shelley 's brother told them before leaving the city himself on thursday .
they 're going to have a look for themselves today , jerry says , but then they 're going back to alexandria - where he is enrolling his three children in a local school .
gonzales , louisiana : monday 1120gmt today is the labor day holiday in the us , traditionally one of the busiest driving weekends of the year .
in fact , there 's an old joke : if all the cars in america were lined up end-to-end , it would probably be labor day .
messages to the world and the neighbours in pictures the main highway from baton rouge into new orleans surpasses the stereotype this morning .
this is my second morning driving into the city as dawn breaks , and today the traffic is even worse than yesterday .
emergency vehicles scream their way south - police cars , ambulances , hazardous material disposal teams , and pick-up truck after truck hauling small boats with outboard motors to search the still-flooded areas of the city .
yesterday there was another type of rescue vehicle on the road as well , america 's famous snub-nosed yellow school bus .
a queue of them at least a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- long trundled towards new orleans from houston , texas , to bring survivors out of the city .
but today there 's extra traffic as well .
monday is the first day residents of some areas of new orleans are officially permitted back to check their property .
they are allowed to be in the city from 6am to 6pm local time , and many obviously got on the road as early as possible .
they 've waited a full week since the storm hit - and with traffic moving at this pace , they will have to wait at least several hours longer .
the flooded streets of new orleans : sunday , 4 september , 1600gmt at this point , many of the people still in flooded sections of new orleans are there because they refuse to leave .
quite a few , it seems , want to stay behind to care for pets .
ron henry and robyn mooney are volunteers who have been carrying out boat rescues for the past two days .
yesterday , they said , they found a guy hiding in his house with his two dobermans .
judy winkel refused to leave to look after her four dogs determined to get him out , they went so far as to threaten to shoot the dogs - but in the end , on advice from their command post , they let him be .
" it was n't worth getting into a gunfight over it , " robyn said .
and in fact , although ron and robyn have been shouting at people that they have to leave or the police will come and take them away in handcuffs due to the mandatory evacuation order , many of the people they found on their first run today insisted on staying behind .
judy winkel 's street is chest-deep in water , but her front porch is dry , and from it she defiantly told ron and robyn she was staying with her four dogs .
she said her husband was out getting water , and sure enough , darren engeron paddled up in a canoe a moment later .
he too insisted he was staying : " i 'm a survivor , " he said .
" i will find water . "
it became clear that ron and robyn could not convince them to leave , so in a parting gesture , they gave judy and darren some advice on how to avoid the patrols .
" take all this stuff off your front porch .
the rescue teams look for clothes drying outside , " robyn said as ron gunned the air boat 's noisy engine to full power .
a few streets away , the people gathered on bernard topping 's front porch were having what looked like a regular sunday-morning chat in the sunshine .
william was relieved to know lake charles had not been affected true , the porch was only an inch or two above the waterline , but no-one seemed to mind - except , perhaps , for william branch .
he wanted to know how things were in the nearby town of lake charles .
" fine , " said robyn .
" they did n't get hit at all . "
william was relieved : his wife and grandchildren were there , he said .
ron and robyn were keen for him to get on board so he could join them , and he wavered for a moment , but ultimately decided to stay .
the folks he was with seemed happy to be where they were - bernard snapped pictures of the rescue boat , while ron chatted with a man on the porch about his boat 's engine .
but when we met up with al coffee at the end of the rescue run , he told a story that put me in mind of william branch and his family in lake charles .
al had found a couple of guys who did n't want to leave .
he found out they both had daughters , so his crew phoned them from their boat so they could plead with the men to ride out .
one refused , even with his daughter screaming at him down the line from florida , but the other one gave in to his daughter 's entreaties from houston .
calling william 's wife in lake charles never occurred to me .
i ca n't help but wonder what would have happened if it had .
jefferson parish , louisiana : sunday 1250gmt the sunrise over lake pontchartrain was beautiful but it revealed my first sight of the devastation hurricane katrina had wrought on new orleans .
i was travelling with al coffee , a retired restaurateur who has been doing voluntary rescue with his own boat , petrol and food for the past week .
al coffee feels the louisiana national guard should be in charge before he talked his way through a police road block to get us into the city he mentioned that the 82nd airborne had been sent into new orleans , to help restore order .
the 82nd are among the most hardened infantry troops in the us army .
they were at the forefront of the invasion of iraq and al coffee is livid that they have been sent to new orleans .
al himself served in the national guard and helped with rescue operations after hurricane camille in 1969 .
he thinks public-order operations like this one should be the responsibility of the louisiana national guard .
but the national guard is in iraq .
baton rouge , louisiana : sunday 0200gmt it was with a curious and very unexpected reluctance that i drove west out of gulfport towards new orleans this afternoon .
i ca n't help but agree with a colleague that " the new orleans story " is overshadowing " the mississippi story " .
the horror of what is happening in new orleans is undeniable , with its flooding , fires and lawlessness .
-lrb- when disease sets in , as it undoubtedly will soon , the big easy will have its fourth horseman . -rrb-
new orleans holds a special place in this country 's heart , having given birth to the now-universal cajun-style cooking , glorious jazz , and the curious french-inflected accent which all americans think they can mimic , though none really can .
new orleans holds a special place in the country 's heart if most americans think of mississippi at all , they probably think of the 1960s racist murders that inspired the film mississippi burning .
it 's one of the country 's poorest states , with a per capita income two-thirds that of the nation as a whole .
only one in six mississippians has a university degree , while one in four americans does .
and it is about one-third black , giving it the highest percentage of african-americans of any state in the us .
it depends heavily on casinos and oil , both industries smashed by katrina .
-lrb- oil will recover quickly . -rrb-
looking out at the wreckage of gulfport 's shoreline , i wondered how long it would take to clean up - and how long it would have taken to clean up had it been , say , one of the wealthy retirement communities in florida .
but drive to baton rouge i did , and was stunned at what i found here : not only electricity and running water , but joggers striding past neatly trimmed lawns .
in two hours i have driven from a war zone to suburban america .
tomorrow i head into the big easy .
gulfport : saturday , 3 september , 2000gmt harrison county 's emergency operations center is becoming more shipshape by the minute - a generator is running power to the building , the outback restaurant has set up a huge grill and is handing out hamburgers and chicken , and men wearing orange harrison county inmate worker t-shirts are busily mopping the floors .
the " inmate workers " are prisoners from the local jail who are helping with disaster relief .
many buildings in gulfport were completely destroyed one of the local sheriff 's deputies told me they were volunteers .
better to be out in the fresh air than locked up inside , he said , but clammed up when i asked more questions .
a moment later , inmate worker steve duke confirmed that he had indeed chosen to help out .
the inmates get time off their sentences for doing community service labour , he said - 30 days ' reduction in sentence for 30 days ' work is the normal trade , but the prisoners are getting unspecified " executive pay " for the disaster relief effort .
but duke was not working to get time off his sentence , he said - he has only 29 days left to serve .
he was doing it because , as he said , " i live here too . "
highway 10 west , mississippi : saturday 1700gmt driving west to see the destruction in bay st louis , a small town near mississippi 's border with louisiana , i picked up a new orleans radio station playing jazz .
not just any old jazz , either , but when the saints go marching in - the signature tune of new orleans jazz - with wailing , screaming horns walking a tightrope between maniacal laughter and uncontrollable tears .
my first thought was that it could be meant as a welcome to the troops who have finally arrived to try to impose some order on the chaotic city .
but listening to those trumpets , i wondered if it was n't a more fundamental cri de coeur , a cry from the heart of the descendants of the original jazzmen who turned their own sorrow , pain and suffering into america 's native music .
gulfport : saturday 1530gmt amid all the destruction of lives , homes , infrastructure and businesses in rural mississippi , some people still have the energy to lament something else katrina took away : the state 's heritage .
kelly robinson , a public information officer with the mississippi emergency management agency , reminded me today that the beachfront was until this week lined with dozens of grand antebellum mansions .
us southerners tell their tales of hurricane survival in pictures " these were 150-to-200-year-old homes .
these old mansions are just gone , nothing left of them but the base . "
oak trees hundreds of years old have been uprooted as well , " plucked like a tulip would be , " she said .
it is not clear that all of the region 's residents will mourn one of the state 's most significant historic sites - the home of jefferson davis , the first and last president of the confederate states of america , which fought the north in the us civil war .
" the slave quarters are gone , " ms robinson said .
" the carriage is lying in a heap of rubble .
it will be a miracle if the house itself is not destroyed .
it 's still standing , but it wo n't be repaired .
" history is gone , " she said .
" history has destroyed history . "
gulfport : saturday 1400gmt for all the talk of help on the way , nothing has changed on the beachfront at gulfport since the storm hit five days ago .
huge lorries meant to haul tropical fruit lie where the storm left them - upturned , worse than useless , now merely rubble to be hauled away themselves .
vehicles lie overturned on the gulfport beachfront and there is more dangerous waste lying on the beach - 40 tons of chicken and a million pounds of shrimp had been sitting in containers on the beach when katrina hit .
they are now scattered across the beachfront , rotting where they lay , a health hazard producing an awful stink .
and they are nearly unrecognisable - though i had been told where to find them , i walked past several before i realised what i was seeing .
my nose found them before my eyes did .
but by far the most unbearable smell comes from a seal , lying on its side and putrefying outside the salmon-coloured copa casino .
there are more humble reminders here , too , of the lives lost and destroyed - a wheelchair sitting abandoned , a videotape of the big bad wolf , the fate of the child who owned it unknown .
biloxi : friday , 2 september , 2330gmt heading back into biloxi to find out what people thought of president bush 's visit today , i saw a fierce sign in front of a house that had been chopped completely in two by a falling tree : you loot ' n ' we shoot .
i wanted to get a picture , but i was n't going to start shooting without permission , so i cautiously pulled into the driveway next door .
as i stepped out of the car , the man in front of the sign turned and reached into his pickup truck .
taking a photo of this sign sparked an angry confrontation i decided a slow , cautious approach would be safer than turning my back , and as luck would have it , when the guy turned back to me , his hands were empty and he was smiling .
i introduced myself and asked if i could take a photo of the sign .
sure , the guy said , my son made it .
but just as i was pulling out my camera , an angry voice behind me called : " hey !
whose truck is this in my driveway ? "
i admitted it was mine and said i 'd only be there for a minute while i took a picture .
" well park it in his driveway ! " she shouted .
" i 'm not telling you to move it - i 'm calling the police ! "
i grabbed a quick shot - for which the man i 'd considered threatening made a peace sign - then scurried back to my vehicle to escape the wrath of the neighbour who turned out to be much fiercer .
i made my way down to the beachfront , where i met a construction worker called ed hess .
deeply tanned , with greying hair reaching down towards his shoulders , he could not have been less moved by george bush 's stop in town .
" you really want to impress me ?
come down here and work with me for a day hauling bricks .
i 've been toting water up nine flights of stairs .
if he could keep up with me , that would impress me - otherwise it 's just talk . "
water park , outside gulfport : friday 1750gmt search and rescue has set up a command post at the water park just outside of gulfport , and it is a hive of activity first thing in the morning - highlighting yet another difference between aid workers , who are busy to the point of exhaustion , and those they have come to rescue , who have little to do but sit and wait .
rescue units have come from as far away as pennsylvania and new york city to aid more local ones from alabama and florida .
no-one here admits it , but hopes of finding trapped survivors must be fading .
col joe spraggins , head of the harrison county emergency management agency , says people can last for five to seven days without food or water , but in this heat that must be optimistic .
and today is officially day four after katrina .
col spraggins says three people were rescued on thursday and 17 corpses were discovered .
so far , search and rescue teams are only following tips from the office of emergency operations , not sweeping wide areas .
gulfport , mississippi : friday 1310gmt gulfport , mississippi , is only a short drive from biloxi , but it feels like a different world .
it was clearly poorer to begin with than biloxi , with its once-attractive seafront historic preservation area of century-old homes .
visitors to gulfport , on the other hand , pass a series of pawnshops , discount stores and offers of cash loans with no credit checks .
now , four days after katrina stomped through , it feels like a curious mixture of ghost town and construction , or deconstruction , site .
military police control traffic at intersections , waving the little civilian traffic past non-working traffic lights , while massive earth-moving vehicles roar along the roads at their lumbering , deliberate pace .
again and again , as i pass buildings smashed into firewood , i have to remind myself that this destruction was a random act of nature , because it looks so much like the product of furious anger .
biloxi , mississippi : thursday , 1 september , 2030gmt mother nature ?
i do n't think so : the nature that tore its way through mississippi 's gulf coast at the beginning of the week was more of a giant , petulant child having a particularly nasty tantrum .
stepping into nothing : little is left standing in parts of biloxi downed trees were the first evidence of the intensity of the storm , from the moment i headed out of mobile .
as i headed towards the town of biloxi , they became more frequent - and were joined by damaged billboards and even the occasional carcass lorries that had been hurled aside like children 's discarded toys .
but , as is often the case with freaks of nature , for every twisted , broken wreck of a billboard , there were half a dozen untouched - many , with cruel irony , advertising the big stars due to perform at the casinos that made biloxi a regional entertainment hub .
somehow , i did n't think merle haggard 's show is going to go on as advertised next week , despite his countenance beaming down along highway 10 .
sally lawson , who worked at one of the largest casinos , confirmed my suspicions as soon as i drove along beach boulevard .
friends of hers had been killed trying to ride out the storm , her daughter was due to give birth at any moment , and she had no idea when she would ever get a pay-cheque again .
petrol station , mobile , alabama : thursday 1540gmt london was revelling in an unexpectedly beautiful late-summer day when i left on wednesday - the parks full of sunbathers , the djs joyously playing in the summertime and a lovely day .
but no sooner was i on the plane to atlanta , georgia , than the mood shifted .
" can i borrow your newspaper ? " a flight attendant asked the man in the seat behind me .
he gave her a blank look .
" i 'm from new orleans , " she said .
his demeanour changed immediately : " of course , " he said .
" take it . "
suddenly the strangers on the plane were a community : " i 'm from new orleans , too . "
where ?
where 's your family ?
are they ok ?
yeah , they made it to atlanta .
they 're in houston .
i 'm from florida , i know what you 're going through .
on the ground in mobile , alabama - about an hour from biloxi , mississippi , one of the worst-affected areas - the mood of solidarity prevails .
there is a sense of solidarity across the affected areas the woman hiring out cars at the airport is hosting a family whose home was destroyed .
warehouse-like supermarkets proudly hoist banners saying : " we 're open . "
and indeed , although the man next to me as we entered the store wondered aloud if there would be any food , the shelves were stocked and the famous southern charm was much in evidence .
every interaction included a question about how my day was going and a genuine-sounding wish that i have a good one .
and on the roads , the drivers are unfailingly polite in their enormous pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles .
even where i am at the moment - in a long queue for petrol .
the woman at the hire-car agency said her husband had waited three hours for fuel yesterday .
at times like these , i 'm grateful for the southern charm , because it 's 90 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 32c -rrb- at 10am .
it 's going to get hotter and stay hot late into the night , and people seem to sense intuitively that politeness is more important than ever .

gulfport , mississippi : saturday , 10 september , 1700gmt americans believe very deeply in two things : business and god .
stopping back in gulfport on my way home , i saw plenty of evidence of the former .
there is still a lot of military traffic , but the city is clearly open for business , less than two weeks after hurricane katrina .
shops and restaurants proudly displayed " we 're open " signs , even as blue tarpaulins were being fastened onto the remains of their roofs .
generators are much in demand the area near the beachfront is technically a closed police zone , but even past the barricades at least two shops were open - a pawnshop and another selling blue jeans .
heavy lifting equipment was clearing away massive rubble around the casinos , including the broken remains of lorries .
meanwhile , new ones were already rolling through town to replace them .
and on highway 49 , just as you pull into town , cliff dann and paul clark have set up by the side of the road to sell generators and mobile homes .
they drove in from florida a day after the storm , cliff says , and have sold more than 300 generators so far .
no matter what happens , it seems , americans will dust themselves off and get back to business .
-lrb- in fact , i saw my first " i survived the big one - hurricane katrina " t-shirts today . -rrb-
but they will also ask themselves why such tragedies happen .
deeply religious , they ask where god was when the winds blew .
new orleans street preachers made homeless by katrina hand out aid and salvation in pictures for some , it seems , nothing can shake their faith .
col joe spraggins is the head of emergency operations in harrison county , which includes gulfport and biloxi .
for days after the storm , he gave twice-daily briefings about how recovery was progressing .
but once , he looked up from his facts and figures and maps to address the broader picture .
" for so many years , " he said , " we 've had everything so easy , so perfect .
when god gives us a disaster , we have to find out why .
it might be to bring us back to reality . "
baton rouge : friday , 9 september , 1600gmt who is to blame ?
it 's a very human response to a catastrophe like the bungled rescue operation following hurricane katrina .
but it 's also an ugly one , driven partly by the intense partisan mood in the united states .
president bush is a republican .
louisiana governor kathleen blanco and senator mary landrieu are democrats .
nationally , much of the anger has focused on national organisations , like the federal emergency management agency -lrb- fema -rrb- , or on president bush himself , who was seen golfing the day after the storm hit .
but here in baton rouge , the louisiana state capital , a talk radio host is venting his fury at gov blanco , who , he says , blocked federal relief from coming in and refused to hand control of the state 's national guard to the president .
" when is she going to stand up in front of the microphones and answer some questions ?
i 'm not blaming her , " he adds , entirely disingenuously .
" i just want some answers . "
but like a tropical storm at sea , he changes directions unexpectedly and demands that his producer phone fema 's emergency help line to see what kind of response evacuees receive - if any .
there is plenty of blame to go around , he concludes .
shortly after his rant - and entirely unrelated to it , i would imagine - fema director mike brown is relieved of his responsibility for katrina relief .
a first sign , perhaps , of the first head to roll .
bogalusa , louisiana : thursday , 8 september , 1700gmt louisiana state highway 21 must have been an extraordinarily beautiful drive two weeks ago - in fact , it 's officially labelled one of the state 's " scenic byways " .
it winds its way north through dense forest , traditional mailboxes on posts by the side of the road marking the houses in the wood .
highway 21 is lined with trees thrown down by the wind but it 's hard to see the forest , for the trees that have been snapped in two draw the eye .
like vandalism that says " katrina was here " , the firs are splintered , lying at jazzy angles , fallen on houses , suspended from downed power lines .
crews have cleared the road and are industriously sawing up the remains of the trees into wood that can be hauled away , but it still looks like the forest has a long , gaping wound .
don brussard , a volunteer who drove from baton rouge to bogalusa to hand out free hot meals , says he was amazed at the damage .
and joshua bridges , 84 , who lives in bogalusa , has seen similar destruction around his own home : " trees you could n't get your arms around have been torn down . "
baton rouge : thursday 1340gmt visiting a maternity ward at a hospital here , i met a new mother who was distraught at having been separated from her three older children .
she was deeply confused , thinking they were still in the new orleans superdome , even though it was finally completely evacuated several days ago .
so i take something else she says with a pinch of salt : that she was left under the bridge near the superdome for three days , heavily pregnant , because rescuers saved elderly and disabled people first .
whether what she said is entirely accurate seems almost beside the point .
people were left there far longer than they should have been , and a norwegian journalist who has been in the city since before the storm is enraged about it .
" we could get in and out by boat - why could n't the government ? " he demanded as we left the new mother 's room .
" it 's a scandal . "
it is a question even children are asking .
one of my colleagues from newsround , the bbc 's children 's news programme , took questions from her audience after reporting from new orleans for several days .
" how could you get in and out ?
why do you have food and water and petrol ? " one of the young people wanted to know .
the answer , of course , is that when push comes to shove , the bbc has the funds to get these things .
but large an organisation as it is , the bbc is a molehill compared to the mountain that is the us government .
congress and george w bush are both setting up inquiries into what went wrong .
the children who watch newsround will be looking forward to an answer .
baton rouge : wednesday , 7 september , 2030gmt do n't call mary ann mercier and her husband eric " refugees " .
like a lot of people who fled hurricane katrina , they bristle at the term .
the merciers are staying with their son " it 's inappropriate , " mary ann , a science teacher , says firmly .
" we were not part of a combat . "
" we were victims of a catastrophe , " eric adds .
the two of them got out of their home in east new orleans before the storm .
they are planning to stay " as long as it takes the city to dry out " - mary ann is looking into working in the local school district for a while - but then they plan to go back to new orleans .
in the meantime , they are amused by at least one aspect of their situation - staying with their son , who is studying nursing at louisiana state university .
" the kids are taking care of us , " eric says .
" it 's payback time . "
baton rouge : wednesday 1440gmt when the radio announcer switched to french , i did a double-take .
what is going on here ?
there must still be french speakers in the bayou , i thought , even 202 years after napoleon sold this land to the united states to raise money for wars against the english .
then i realised - even with my non-existent french - what i was hearing .
it was a plea for foreign nationals evacuated from new orleans to contact the french consulate .
later , the announcement was repeated in spanish , with a number for the mexican consulate .
it 's not only the people of new orleans itself who are frantic about their loved ones , or even only americans .
all around the world , families are still holding their breath , hoping against hope their loved ones got out alive .
baton rouge : tuesday , 6 september , 2200gmt i am getting used to the four-hour drive it takes to get 70 miles from baton rouge to new orleans , but the return journey has always been a breeze .
until today .
today , it took just as long to get into baton rouge as it did to get into new orleans .
going into the big easy , the problem is roadblocks .
going into the state capital , it is gridlock .
evacuees - they hate being called refugees , apparently - have reportedly doubled the size of the population here .
with tuesday being the first day of the new school year and the first day back to work after a long weekend , traffic was out of control .
people will certainly not be allowed back into new orleans for at least a month , so those who have fled here seem likely to stay here .
baton rouge was publicly proud of having taken in so many people , as well it should be .
but crime is reportedly on the rise .
traffic may soon be the least of the problems here .
the french quarter , new orleans : tuesday 1715gmt new orleans has turned a corner .
yes , emergency boats are still out combing the water-logged streets for survivors , and yes , it will be weeks before the city is dry enough for anyone even to know what can be saved and what will have to be bulldozed .
but the army is out in force and looting seems to be in precipitous decline - and today one of the city 's main canals was repaired .
mayor ray nagin said after a helicopter tour that perhaps only 60 % of the city was flooded , down from 80 % at the worst point .
so while this may quite not be the beginning of the crescent city 's recovery , it feels like - as winston churchill might have said - the beginning of the beginning .
but even once repair and reconstruction begin in earnest , more suffering awaits those caught up in hurricane katrina .
i have reported on post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , the mental trauma often experienced by survivors of horrifying experiences .
and while i hate to think of everything as a nail merely because i have a hammer , i am already seeing the signs of ptsd among people i talk to .
perhaps the five-year veteran of the new orleans police who spoke to me in the french quarter always had that intense nervous energy .
perhaps his eyes always darted around as he conversed with people .
or perhaps he has been traumatised by having spent a week at the superdome , where refugees from the storm were trapped in what everyone agrees was a living hell .
law enforcement officials and national guard troops - who were there to maintain order - instead set up camp and huddled in a corner for their own protection , he said .
" it was too hot to sleep in the day and too dangerous to sleep at night , " a colleague of his piped up .
and the storm itself made an incredible impression on the officer , whom i wo n't name because he was not supposed to speak to the press .
" i ca n't even gauge the speed of the wind , but i was looking out the window of the superdome and everything was going sideways .
" i 'm not afraid of anything , " he said .
" and i was terrified . "
saint charles parish , north east of new orleans : tuesday 1315gmt a huge oil refinery sprawls out in both directions from the road into new orleans .
oil is as important an industry on this gulf coast as it is in the more famous gulf in the middle east .
some experts fear that the needs of the oil industry may have inadvertently robbed new orleans of protection from the storm surge that turned the city from amsterdam into venice .
engineers are hard at work repairing the city 's flood defences new orleans lies at the mouth of the mississippi river , north america 's mightiest river system .
from time immemorial , the river has been depositing silt in the mississippi delta , creating a buffer zone between the city and the gulf of mexico .
but man has insisted on controlling the mississippi for the convenience of business and industry .
engineers have dammed and lined the river to keep it tamed , severely reducing the size of the delta in the process .
so when katrina hit , new orleans had little protection from one of the greatest storm surges america has ever seen .
today , engineers are starting to pump out the water that storm surge deposited .
engineering helping to repair the damage that engineering caused .
experts are pleading with government and business to think seriously before new orleans embarks on its next major engineering project - rebuilding itself after the storm .
highway 61 north , heading to baton rouge : monday , 5 september , 1530gmt i did n't make it into new orleans today - i was distracted by a family on a rescue mission and lost my place in the queue .
after parting with the family , i headed back north to baton rouge , revisiting highway 61 .
i checked the odometer ... and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long only then did i get an idea of the magnitude of traffic trying to get into new orleans on this , the first day people are being let back into part of the city to inspect their homes .
it was clear there was no way i would be able to count the cars on the road , so i checked the odometer instead - and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long .
and there were more cars backed up at a checkpoint further up the road - a three-mile queue .
i regret not getting into new orleans today - but more importantly , i hope everyone sweltering in their cars does .
highway 61 south , en route to new orleans : monday 1320gmt the rumours and speculation i have been hearing are correct .
people are abandoning new orleans for good .
as cars inched their way towards the city , i talked to jerry goff , 58 , who retired two years ago after 33 years working in oil refinery .
jerry goff is moving his family away from new orleans he and his wife shelly left their house in marrero on the west bank of the mississippi on sunday , before the storm hit , and took shelter with his parents in alexandria , central louisiana .
they watched on tv as the storm battered their home town .
" it was bad .
real bad , " jerry says .
their house was three feet deep in water , shelley 's brother told them before leaving the city himself on thursday .
they 're going to have a look for themselves today , jerry says , but then they 're going back to alexandria - where he is enrolling his three children in a local school .
gonzales , louisiana : monday 1120gmt today is the labor day holiday in the us , traditionally one of the busiest driving weekends of the year .
in fact , there 's an old joke : if all the cars in america were lined up end-to-end , it would probably be labor day .
messages to the world and the neighbours in pictures the main highway from baton rouge into new orleans surpasses the stereotype this morning .
this is my second morning driving into the city as dawn breaks , and today the traffic is even worse than yesterday .
emergency vehicles scream their way south - police cars , ambulances , hazardous material disposal teams , and pick-up truck after truck hauling small boats with outboard motors to search the still-flooded areas of the city .
yesterday there was another type of rescue vehicle on the road as well , america 's famous snub-nosed yellow school bus .
a queue of them at least a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- long trundled towards new orleans from houston , texas , to bring survivors out of the city .
but today there 's extra traffic as well .
monday is the first day residents of some areas of new orleans are officially permitted back to check their property .
they are allowed to be in the city from 6am to 6pm local time , and many obviously got on the road as early as possible .
they 've waited a full week since the storm hit - and with traffic moving at this pace , they will have to wait at least several hours longer .
the flooded streets of new orleans : sunday , 4 september , 1600gmt at this point , many of the people still in flooded sections of new orleans are there because they refuse to leave .
quite a few , it seems , want to stay behind to care for pets .
ron henry and robyn mooney are volunteers who have been carrying out boat rescues for the past two days .
yesterday , they said , they found a guy hiding in his house with his two dobermans .
judy winkel refused to leave to look after her four dogs determined to get him out , they went so far as to threaten to shoot the dogs - but in the end , on advice from their command post , they let him be .
" it was n't worth getting into a gunfight over it , " robyn said .
and in fact , although ron and robyn have been shouting at people that they have to leave or the police will come and take them away in handcuffs due to the mandatory evacuation order , many of the people they found on their first run today insisted on staying behind .
judy winkel 's street is chest-deep in water , but her front porch is dry , and from it she defiantly told ron and robyn she was staying with her four dogs .
she said her husband was out getting water , and sure enough , darren engeron paddled up in a canoe a moment later .
he too insisted he was staying : " i 'm a survivor , " he said .
" i will find water . "
it became clear that ron and robyn could not convince them to leave , so in a parting gesture , they gave judy and darren some advice on how to avoid the patrols .
" take all this stuff off your front porch .
the rescue teams look for clothes drying outside , " robyn said as ron gunned the air boat 's noisy engine to full power .
a few streets away , the people gathered on bernard topping 's front porch were having what looked like a regular sunday-morning chat in the sunshine .
william was relieved to know lake charles had not been affected true , the porch was only an inch or two above the waterline , but no-one seemed to mind - except , perhaps , for william branch .
he wanted to know how things were in the nearby town of lake charles .
" fine , " said robyn .
" they did n't get hit at all . "
william was relieved : his wife and grandchildren were there , he said .
ron and robyn were keen for him to get on board so he could join them , and he wavered for a moment , but ultimately decided to stay .
the folks he was with seemed happy to be where they were - bernard snapped pictures of the rescue boat , while ron chatted with a man on the porch about his boat 's engine .
but when we met up with al coffee at the end of the rescue run , he told a story that put me in mind of william branch and his family in lake charles .
al had found a couple of guys who did n't want to leave .
he found out they both had daughters , so his crew phoned them from their boat so they could plead with the men to ride out .
one refused , even with his daughter screaming at him down the line from florida , but the other one gave in to his daughter 's entreaties from houston .
calling william 's wife in lake charles never occurred to me .
i ca n't help but wonder what would have happened if it had .
jefferson parish , louisiana : sunday 1250gmt the sunrise over lake pontchartrain was beautiful but it revealed my first sight of the devastation hurricane katrina had wrought on new orleans .
i was travelling with al coffee , a retired restaurateur who has been doing voluntary rescue with his own boat , petrol and food for the past week .
al coffee feels the louisiana national guard should be in charge before he talked his way through a police road block to get us into the city he mentioned that the 82nd airborne had been sent into new orleans , to help restore order .
the 82nd are among the most hardened infantry troops in the us army .
they were at the forefront of the invasion of iraq and al coffee is livid that they have been sent to new orleans .
al himself served in the national guard and helped with rescue operations after hurricane camille in 1969 .
he thinks public-order operations like this one should be the responsibility of the louisiana national guard .
but the national guard is in iraq .
baton rouge , louisiana : sunday 0200gmt it was with a curious and very unexpected reluctance that i drove west out of gulfport towards new orleans this afternoon .
i ca n't help but agree with a colleague that " the new orleans story " is overshadowing " the mississippi story " .
the horror of what is happening in new orleans is undeniable , with its flooding , fires and lawlessness .
-lrb- when disease sets in , as it undoubtedly will soon , the big easy will have its fourth horseman . -rrb-
new orleans holds a special place in this country 's heart , having given birth to the now-universal cajun-style cooking , glorious jazz , and the curious french-inflected accent which all americans think they can mimic , though none really can .
new orleans holds a special place in the country 's heart if most americans think of mississippi at all , they probably think of the 1960s racist murders that inspired the film mississippi burning .
it 's one of the country 's poorest states , with a per capita income two-thirds that of the nation as a whole .
only one in six mississippians has a university degree , while one in four americans does .
and it is about one-third black , giving it the highest percentage of african-americans of any state in the us .
it depends heavily on casinos and oil , both industries smashed by katrina .
-lrb- oil will recover quickly . -rrb-
looking out at the wreckage of gulfport 's shoreline , i wondered how long it would take to clean up - and how long it would have taken to clean up had it been , say , one of the wealthy retirement communities in florida .
but drive to baton rouge i did , and was stunned at what i found here : not only electricity and running water , but joggers striding past neatly trimmed lawns .
in two hours i have driven from a war zone to suburban america .
tomorrow i head into the big easy .
gulfport : saturday , 3 september , 2000gmt harrison county 's emergency operations center is becoming more shipshape by the minute - a generator is running power to the building , the outback restaurant has set up a huge grill and is handing out hamburgers and chicken , and men wearing orange harrison county inmate worker t-shirts are busily mopping the floors .
the " inmate workers " are prisoners from the local jail who are helping with disaster relief .
many buildings in gulfport were completely destroyed one of the local sheriff 's deputies told me they were volunteers .
better to be out in the fresh air than locked up inside , he said , but clammed up when i asked more questions .
a moment later , inmate worker steve duke confirmed that he had indeed chosen to help out .
the inmates get time off their sentences for doing community service labour , he said - 30 days ' reduction in sentence for 30 days ' work is the normal trade , but the prisoners are getting unspecified " executive pay " for the disaster relief effort .
but duke was not working to get time off his sentence , he said - he has only 29 days left to serve .
he was doing it because , as he said , " i live here too . "
highway 10 west , mississippi : saturday 1700gmt driving west to see the destruction in bay st louis , a small town near mississippi 's border with louisiana , i picked up a new orleans radio station playing jazz .
not just any old jazz , either , but when the saints go marching in - the signature tune of new orleans jazz - with wailing , screaming horns walking a tightrope between maniacal laughter and uncontrollable tears .
my first thought was that it could be meant as a welcome to the troops who have finally arrived to try to impose some order on the chaotic city .
but listening to those trumpets , i wondered if it was n't a more fundamental cri de coeur , a cry from the heart of the descendants of the original jazzmen who turned their own sorrow , pain and suffering into america 's native music .
gulfport : saturday 1530gmt amid all the destruction of lives , homes , infrastructure and businesses in rural mississippi , some people still have the energy to lament something else katrina took away : the state 's heritage .
kelly robinson , a public information officer with the mississippi emergency management agency , reminded me today that the beachfront was until this week lined with dozens of grand antebellum mansions .
us southerners tell their tales of hurricane survival in pictures " these were 150-to-200-year-old homes .
these old mansions are just gone , nothing left of them but the base . "
oak trees hundreds of years old have been uprooted as well , " plucked like a tulip would be , " she said .
it is not clear that all of the region 's residents will mourn one of the state 's most significant historic sites - the home of jefferson davis , the first and last president of the confederate states of america , which fought the north in the us civil war .
" the slave quarters are gone , " ms robinson said .
" the carriage is lying in a heap of rubble .
it will be a miracle if the house itself is not destroyed .
it 's still standing , but it wo n't be repaired .
" history is gone , " she said .
" history has destroyed history . "
gulfport : saturday 1400gmt for all the talk of help on the way , nothing has changed on the beachfront at gulfport since the storm hit five days ago .
huge lorries meant to haul tropical fruit lie where the storm left them - upturned , worse than useless , now merely rubble to be hauled away themselves .
vehicles lie overturned on the gulfport beachfront and there is more dangerous waste lying on the beach - 40 tons of chicken and a million pounds of shrimp had been sitting in containers on the beach when katrina hit .
they are now scattered across the beachfront , rotting where they lay , a health hazard producing an awful stink .
and they are nearly unrecognisable - though i had been told where to find them , i walked past several before i realised what i was seeing .
my nose found them before my eyes did .
but by far the most unbearable smell comes from a seal , lying on its side and putrefying outside the salmon-coloured copa casino .
there are more humble reminders here , too , of the lives lost and destroyed - a wheelchair sitting abandoned , a videotape of the big bad wolf , the fate of the child who owned it unknown .
biloxi : friday , 2 september , 2330gmt heading back into biloxi to find out what people thought of president bush 's visit today , i saw a fierce sign in front of a house that had been chopped completely in two by a falling tree : you loot ' n ' we shoot .
i wanted to get a picture , but i was n't going to start shooting without permission , so i cautiously pulled into the driveway next door .
as i stepped out of the car , the man in front of the sign turned and reached into his pickup truck .
taking a photo of this sign sparked an angry confrontation i decided a slow , cautious approach would be safer than turning my back , and as luck would have it , when the guy turned back to me , his hands were empty and he was smiling .
i introduced myself and asked if i could take a photo of the sign .
sure , the guy said , my son made it .
but just as i was pulling out my camera , an angry voice behind me called : " hey !
whose truck is this in my driveway ? "
i admitted it was mine and said i 'd only be there for a minute while i took a picture .
" well park it in his driveway ! " she shouted .
" i 'm not telling you to move it - i 'm calling the police ! "
i grabbed a quick shot - for which the man i 'd considered threatening made a peace sign - then scurried back to my vehicle to escape the wrath of the neighbour who turned out to be much fiercer .
i made my way down to the beachfront , where i met a construction worker called ed hess .
deeply tanned , with greying hair reaching down towards his shoulders , he could not have been less moved by george bush 's stop in town .
" you really want to impress me ?
come down here and work with me for a day hauling bricks .
i 've been toting water up nine flights of stairs .
if he could keep up with me , that would impress me - otherwise it 's just talk . "
water park , outside gulfport : friday 1750gmt search and rescue has set up a command post at the water park just outside of gulfport , and it is a hive of activity first thing in the morning - highlighting yet another difference between aid workers , who are busy to the point of exhaustion , and those they have come to rescue , who have little to do but sit and wait .
rescue units have come from as far away as pennsylvania and new york city to aid more local ones from alabama and florida .
no-one here admits it , but hopes of finding trapped survivors must be fading .
col joe spraggins , head of the harrison county emergency management agency , says people can last for five to seven days without food or water , but in this heat that must be optimistic .
and today is officially day four after katrina .
col spraggins says three people were rescued on thursday and 17 corpses were discovered .
so far , search and rescue teams are only following tips from the office of emergency operations , not sweeping wide areas .
gulfport , mississippi : friday 1310gmt gulfport , mississippi , is only a short drive from biloxi , but it feels like a different world .
it was clearly poorer to begin with than biloxi , with its once-attractive seafront historic preservation area of century-old homes .
visitors to gulfport , on the other hand , pass a series of pawnshops , discount stores and offers of cash loans with no credit checks .
now , four days after katrina stomped through , it feels like a curious mixture of ghost town and construction , or deconstruction , site .
military police control traffic at intersections , waving the little civilian traffic past non-working traffic lights , while massive earth-moving vehicles roar along the roads at their lumbering , deliberate pace .
again and again , as i pass buildings smashed into firewood , i have to remind myself that this destruction was a random act of nature , because it looks so much like the product of furious anger .
biloxi , mississippi : thursday , 1 september , 2030gmt mother nature ?
i do n't think so : the nature that tore its way through mississippi 's gulf coast at the beginning of the week was more of a giant , petulant child having a particularly nasty tantrum .
stepping into nothing : little is left standing in parts of biloxi downed trees were the first evidence of the intensity of the storm , from the moment i headed out of mobile .
as i headed towards the town of biloxi , they became more frequent - and were joined by damaged billboards and even the occasional carcass lorries that had been hurled aside like children 's discarded toys .
but , as is often the case with freaks of nature , for every twisted , broken wreck of a billboard , there were half a dozen untouched - many , with cruel irony , advertising the big stars due to perform at the casinos that made biloxi a regional entertainment hub .
somehow , i did n't think merle haggard 's show is going to go on as advertised next week , despite his countenance beaming down along highway 10 .
sally lawson , who worked at one of the largest casinos , confirmed my suspicions as soon as i drove along beach boulevard .
friends of hers had been killed trying to ride out the storm , her daughter was due to give birth at any moment , and she had no idea when she would ever get a pay-cheque again .
petrol station , mobile , alabama : thursday 1540gmt london was revelling in an unexpectedly beautiful late-summer day when i left on wednesday - the parks full of sunbathers , the djs joyously playing in the summertime and a lovely day .
but no sooner was i on the plane to atlanta , georgia , than the mood shifted .
" can i borrow your newspaper ? " a flight attendant asked the man in the seat behind me .
he gave her a blank look .
" i 'm from new orleans , " she said .
his demeanour changed immediately : " of course , " he said .
" take it . "
suddenly the strangers on the plane were a community : " i 'm from new orleans , too . "
where ?
where 's your family ?
are they ok ?
yeah , they made it to atlanta .
they 're in houston .
i 'm from florida , i know what you 're going through .
on the ground in mobile , alabama - about an hour from biloxi , mississippi , one of the worst-affected areas - the mood of solidarity prevails .
there is a sense of solidarity across the affected areas the woman hiring out cars at the airport is hosting a family whose home was destroyed .
warehouse-like supermarkets proudly hoist banners saying : " we 're open . "
and indeed , although the man next to me as we entered the store wondered aloud if there would be any food , the shelves were stocked and the famous southern charm was much in evidence .
every interaction included a question about how my day was going and a genuine-sounding wish that i have a good one .
and on the roads , the drivers are unfailingly polite in their enormous pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles .
even where i am at the moment - in a long queue for petrol .
the woman at the hire-car agency said her husband had waited three hours for fuel yesterday .
at times like these , i 'm grateful for the southern charm , because it 's 90 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 32c -rrb- at 10am .
it 's going to get hotter and stay hot late into the night , and people seem to sense intuitively that politeness is more important than ever .

here he shares his experience of the journey and the people he met along the way .
gulfport , mississippi : saturday , 10 september , 1700gmt americans believe very deeply in two things : business and god .
stopping back in gulfport on my way home , i saw plenty of evidence of the former .
there is still a lot of military traffic , but the city is clearly open for business , less than two weeks after hurricane katrina .
shops and restaurants proudly displayed " we 're open " signs , even as blue tarpaulins were being fastened onto the remains of their roofs .
generators are much in demand the area near the beachfront is technically a closed police zone , but even past the barricades at least two shops were open - a pawnshop and another selling blue jeans .
heavy lifting equipment was clearing away massive rubble around the casinos , including the broken remains of lorries .
meanwhile , new ones were already rolling through town to replace them .
and on highway 49 , just as you pull into town , cliff dann and paul clark have set up by the side of the road to sell generators and mobile homes .
they drove in from florida a day after the storm , cliff says , and have sold more than 300 generators so far .
no matter what happens , it seems , americans will dust themselves off and get back to business .
-lrb- in fact , i saw my first " i survived the big one - hurricane katrina " t-shirts today . -rrb-
but they will also ask themselves why such tragedies happen .
deeply religious , they ask where god was when the winds blew .
new orleans street preachers made homeless by katrina hand out aid and salvation in pictures for some , it seems , nothing can shake their faith .
col joe spraggins is the head of emergency operations in harrison county , which includes gulfport and biloxi .
for days after the storm , he gave twice-daily briefings about how recovery was progressing .
but once , he looked up from his facts and figures and maps to address the broader picture .
" for so many years , " he said , " we 've had everything so easy , so perfect .
when god gives us a disaster , we have to find out why .
it might be to bring us back to reality . "
baton rouge : friday , 9 september , 1600gmt who is to blame ?
it 's a very human response to a catastrophe like the bungled rescue operation following hurricane katrina .
but it 's also an ugly one , driven partly by the intense partisan mood in the united states .
president bush is a republican .
louisiana governor kathleen blanco and senator mary landrieu are democrats .
nationally , much of the anger has focused on national organisations , like the federal emergency management agency -lrb- fema -rrb- , or on president bush himself , who was seen golfing the day after the storm hit .
but here in baton rouge , the louisiana state capital , a talk radio host is venting his fury at gov blanco , who , he says , blocked federal relief from coming in and refused to hand control of the state 's national guard to the president .
" when is she going to stand up in front of the microphones and answer some questions ?
i 'm not blaming her , " he adds , entirely disingenuously .
" i just want some answers . "
but like a tropical storm at sea , he changes directions unexpectedly and demands that his producer phone fema 's emergency help line to see what kind of response evacuees receive - if any .
there is plenty of blame to go around , he concludes .
shortly after his rant - and entirely unrelated to it , i would imagine - fema director mike brown is relieved of his responsibility for katrina relief .
a first sign , perhaps , of the first head to roll .
bogalusa , louisiana : thursday , 8 september , 1700gmt louisiana state highway 21 must have been an extraordinarily beautiful drive two weeks ago - in fact , it 's officially labelled one of the state 's " scenic byways " .
it winds its way north through dense forest , traditional mailboxes on posts by the side of the road marking the houses in the wood .
highway 21 is lined with trees thrown down by the wind but it 's hard to see the forest , for the trees that have been snapped in two draw the eye .
like vandalism that says " katrina was here " , the firs are splintered , lying at jazzy angles , fallen on houses , suspended from downed power lines .
crews have cleared the road and are industriously sawing up the remains of the trees into wood that can be hauled away , but it still looks like the forest has a long , gaping wound .
don brussard , a volunteer who drove from baton rouge to bogalusa to hand out free hot meals , says he was amazed at the damage .
and joshua bridges , 84 , who lives in bogalusa , has seen similar destruction around his own home : " trees you could n't get your arms around have been torn down . "
baton rouge : thursday 1340gmt visiting a maternity ward at a hospital here , i met a new mother who was distraught at having been separated from her three older children .
she was deeply confused , thinking they were still in the new orleans superdome , even though it was finally completely evacuated several days ago .
so i take something else she says with a pinch of salt : that she was left under the bridge near the superdome for three days , heavily pregnant , because rescuers saved elderly and disabled people first .
whether what she said is entirely accurate seems almost beside the point .
people were left there far longer than they should have been , and a norwegian journalist who has been in the city since before the storm is enraged about it .
" we could get in and out by boat - why could n't the government ? " he demanded as we left the new mother 's room .
" it 's a scandal . "
it is a question even children are asking .
one of my colleagues from newsround , the bbc 's children 's news programme , took questions from her audience after reporting from new orleans for several days .
" how could you get in and out ?
why do you have food and water and petrol ? " one of the young people wanted to know .
the answer , of course , is that when push comes to shove , the bbc has the funds to get these things .
but large an organisation as it is , the bbc is a molehill compared to the mountain that is the us government .
congress and george w bush are both setting up inquiries into what went wrong .
the children who watch newsround will be looking forward to an answer .
baton rouge : wednesday , 7 september , 2030gmt do n't call mary ann mercier and her husband eric " refugees " .
like a lot of people who fled hurricane katrina , they bristle at the term .
the merciers are staying with their son " it 's inappropriate , " mary ann , a science teacher , says firmly .
" we were not part of a combat . "
" we were victims of a catastrophe , " eric adds .
the two of them got out of their home in east new orleans before the storm .
they are planning to stay " as long as it takes the city to dry out " - mary ann is looking into working in the local school district for a while - but then they plan to go back to new orleans .
in the meantime , they are amused by at least one aspect of their situation - staying with their son , who is studying nursing at louisiana state university .
" the kids are taking care of us , " eric says .
" it 's payback time . "
baton rouge : wednesday 1440gmt when the radio announcer switched to french , i did a double-take .
what is going on here ?
there must still be french speakers in the bayou , i thought , even 202 years after napoleon sold this land to the united states to raise money for wars against the english .
then i realised - even with my non-existent french - what i was hearing .
it was a plea for foreign nationals evacuated from new orleans to contact the french consulate .
later , the announcement was repeated in spanish , with a number for the mexican consulate .
it 's not only the people of new orleans itself who are frantic about their loved ones , or even only americans .
all around the world , families are still holding their breath , hoping against hope their loved ones got out alive .
baton rouge : tuesday , 6 september , 2200gmt i am getting used to the four-hour drive it takes to get 70 miles from baton rouge to new orleans , but the return journey has always been a breeze .
until today .
today , it took just as long to get into baton rouge as it did to get into new orleans .
going into the big easy , the problem is roadblocks .
going into the state capital , it is gridlock .
evacuees - they hate being called refugees , apparently - have reportedly doubled the size of the population here .
with tuesday being the first day of the new school year and the first day back to work after a long weekend , traffic was out of control .
people will certainly not be allowed back into new orleans for at least a month , so those who have fled here seem likely to stay here .
baton rouge was publicly proud of having taken in so many people , as well it should be .
but crime is reportedly on the rise .
traffic may soon be the least of the problems here .
the french quarter , new orleans : tuesday 1715gmt new orleans has turned a corner .
yes , emergency boats are still out combing the water-logged streets for survivors , and yes , it will be weeks before the city is dry enough for anyone even to know what can be saved and what will have to be bulldozed .
but the army is out in force and looting seems to be in precipitous decline - and today one of the city 's main canals was repaired .
mayor ray nagin said after a helicopter tour that perhaps only 60 % of the city was flooded , down from 80 % at the worst point .
so while this may quite not be the beginning of the crescent city 's recovery , it feels like - as winston churchill might have said - the beginning of the beginning .
but even once repair and reconstruction begin in earnest , more suffering awaits those caught up in hurricane katrina .
i have reported on post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , the mental trauma often experienced by survivors of horrifying experiences .
and while i hate to think of everything as a nail merely because i have a hammer , i am already seeing the signs of ptsd among people i talk to .
perhaps the five-year veteran of the new orleans police who spoke to me in the french quarter always had that intense nervous energy .
perhaps his eyes always darted around as he conversed with people .
or perhaps he has been traumatised by having spent a week at the superdome , where refugees from the storm were trapped in what everyone agrees was a living hell .
law enforcement officials and national guard troops - who were there to maintain order - instead set up camp and huddled in a corner for their own protection , he said .
" it was too hot to sleep in the day and too dangerous to sleep at night , " a colleague of his piped up .
and the storm itself made an incredible impression on the officer , whom i wo n't name because he was not supposed to speak to the press .
" i ca n't even gauge the speed of the wind , but i was looking out the window of the superdome and everything was going sideways .
" i 'm not afraid of anything , " he said .
" and i was terrified . "
saint charles parish , north east of new orleans : tuesday 1315gmt a huge oil refinery sprawls out in both directions from the road into new orleans .
oil is as important an industry on this gulf coast as it is in the more famous gulf in the middle east .
some experts fear that the needs of the oil industry may have inadvertently robbed new orleans of protection from the storm surge that turned the city from amsterdam into venice .
engineers are hard at work repairing the city 's flood defences new orleans lies at the mouth of the mississippi river , north america 's mightiest river system .
from time immemorial , the river has been depositing silt in the mississippi delta , creating a buffer zone between the city and the gulf of mexico .
but man has insisted on controlling the mississippi for the convenience of business and industry .
engineers have dammed and lined the river to keep it tamed , severely reducing the size of the delta in the process .
so when katrina hit , new orleans had little protection from one of the greatest storm surges america has ever seen .
today , engineers are starting to pump out the water that storm surge deposited .
engineering helping to repair the damage that engineering caused .
experts are pleading with government and business to think seriously before new orleans embarks on its next major engineering project - rebuilding itself after the storm .
highway 61 north , heading to baton rouge : monday , 5 september , 1530gmt i did n't make it into new orleans today - i was distracted by a family on a rescue mission and lost my place in the queue .
after parting with the family , i headed back north to baton rouge , revisiting highway 61 .
i checked the odometer ... and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long only then did i get an idea of the magnitude of traffic trying to get into new orleans on this , the first day people are being let back into part of the city to inspect their homes .
it was clear there was no way i would be able to count the cars on the road , so i checked the odometer instead - and found the queue on highway 61 was about 15 miles long .
and there were more cars backed up at a checkpoint further up the road - a three-mile queue .
i regret not getting into new orleans today - but more importantly , i hope everyone sweltering in their cars does .
highway 61 south , en route to new orleans : monday 1320gmt the rumours and speculation i have been hearing are correct .
people are abandoning new orleans for good .
as cars inched their way towards the city , i talked to jerry goff , 58 , who retired two years ago after 33 years working in oil refinery .
jerry goff is moving his family away from new orleans he and his wife shelly left their house in marrero on the west bank of the mississippi on sunday , before the storm hit , and took shelter with his parents in alexandria , central louisiana .
they watched on tv as the storm battered their home town .
" it was bad .
real bad , " jerry says .
their house was three feet deep in water , shelley 's brother told them before leaving the city himself on thursday .
they 're going to have a look for themselves today , jerry says , but then they 're going back to alexandria - where he is enrolling his three children in a local school .
gonzales , louisiana : monday 1120gmt today is the labor day holiday in the us , traditionally one of the busiest driving weekends of the year .
in fact , there 's an old joke : if all the cars in america were lined up end-to-end , it would probably be labor day .
messages to the world and the neighbours in pictures the main highway from baton rouge into new orleans surpasses the stereotype this morning .
this is my second morning driving into the city as dawn breaks , and today the traffic is even worse than yesterday .
emergency vehicles scream their way south - police cars , ambulances , hazardous material disposal teams , and pick-up truck after truck hauling small boats with outboard motors to search the still-flooded areas of the city .
yesterday there was another type of rescue vehicle on the road as well , america 's famous snub-nosed yellow school bus .
a queue of them at least a mile -lrb- 1.6km -rrb- long trundled towards new orleans from houston , texas , to bring survivors out of the city .
but today there 's extra traffic as well .
monday is the first day residents of some areas of new orleans are officially permitted back to check their property .
they are allowed to be in the city from 6am to 6pm local time , and many obviously got on the road as early as possible .
they 've waited a full week since the storm hit - and with traffic moving at this pace , they will have to wait at least several hours longer .
the flooded streets of new orleans : sunday , 4 september , 1600gmt at this point , many of the people still in flooded sections of new orleans are there because they refuse to leave .
quite a few , it seems , want to stay behind to care for pets .
ron henry and robyn mooney are volunteers who have been carrying out boat rescues for the past two days .
yesterday , they said , they found a guy hiding in his house with his two dobermans .
judy winkel refused to leave to look after her four dogs determined to get him out , they went so far as to threaten to shoot the dogs - but in the end , on advice from their command post , they let him be .
" it was n't worth getting into a gunfight over it , " robyn said .
and in fact , although ron and robyn have been shouting at people that they have to leave or the police will come and take them away in handcuffs due to the mandatory evacuation order , many of the people they found on their first run today insisted on staying behind .
judy winkel 's street is chest-deep in water , but her front porch is dry , and from it she defiantly told ron and robyn she was staying with her four dogs .
she said her husband was out getting water , and sure enough , darren engeron paddled up in a canoe a moment later .
he too insisted he was staying : " i 'm a survivor , " he said .
" i will find water . "
it became clear that ron and robyn could not convince them to leave , so in a parting gesture , they gave judy and darren some advice on how to avoid the patrols .
" take all this stuff off your front porch .
the rescue teams look for clothes drying outside , " robyn said as ron gunned the air boat 's noisy engine to full power .
a few streets away , the people gathered on bernard topping 's front porch were having what looked like a regular sunday-morning chat in the sunshine .
william was relieved to know lake charles had not been affected true , the porch was only an inch or two above the waterline , but no-one seemed to mind - except , perhaps , for william branch .
he wanted to know how things were in the nearby town of lake charles .
" fine , " said robyn .
" they did n't get hit at all . "
william was relieved : his wife and grandchildren were there , he said .
ron and robyn were keen for him to get on board so he could join them , and he wavered for a moment , but ultimately decided to stay .
the folks he was with seemed happy to be where they were - bernard snapped pictures of the rescue boat , while ron chatted with a man on the porch about his boat 's engine .
but when we met up with al coffee at the end of the rescue run , he told a story that put me in mind of william branch and his family in lake charles .
al had found a couple of guys who did n't want to leave .
he found out they both had daughters , so his crew phoned them from their boat so they could plead with the men to ride out .
one refused , even with his daughter screaming at him down the line from florida , but the other one gave in to his daughter 's entreaties from houston .
calling william 's wife in lake charles never occurred to me .
i ca n't help but wonder what would have happened if it had .
jefferson parish , louisiana : sunday 1250gmt the sunrise over lake pontchartrain was beautiful but it revealed my first sight of the devastation hurricane katrina had wrought on new orleans .
i was travelling with al coffee , a retired restaurateur who has been doing voluntary rescue with his own boat , petrol and food for the past week .
al coffee feels the louisiana national guard should be in charge before he talked his way through a police road block to get us into the city he mentioned that the 82nd airborne had been sent into new orleans , to help restore order .
the 82nd are among the most hardened infantry troops in the us army .
they were at the forefront of the invasion of iraq and al coffee is livid that they have been sent to new orleans .
al himself served in the national guard and helped with rescue operations after hurricane camille in 1969 .
he thinks public-order operations like this one should be the responsibility of the louisiana national guard .
but the national guard is in iraq .
baton rouge , louisiana : sunday 0200gmt it was with a curious and very unexpected reluctance that i drove west out of gulfport towards new orleans this afternoon .
i ca n't help but agree with a colleague that " the new orleans story " is overshadowing " the mississippi story " .
the horror of what is happening in new orleans is undeniable , with its flooding , fires and lawlessness .
-lrb- when disease sets in , as it undoubtedly will soon , the big easy will have its fourth horseman . -rrb-
new orleans holds a special place in this country 's heart , having given birth to the now-universal cajun-style cooking , glorious jazz , and the curious french-inflected accent which all americans think they can mimic , though none really can .
new orleans holds a special place in the country 's heart if most americans think of mississippi at all , they probably think of the 1960s racist murders that inspired the film mississippi burning .
it 's one of the country 's poorest states , with a per capita income two-thirds that of the nation as a whole .
only one in six mississippians has a university degree , while one in four americans does .
and it is about one-third black , giving it the highest percentage of african-americans of any state in the us .
it depends heavily on casinos and oil , both industries smashed by katrina .
-lrb- oil will recover quickly . -rrb-
looking out at the wreckage of gulfport 's shoreline , i wondered how long it would take to clean up - and how long it would have taken to clean up had it been , say , one of the wealthy retirement communities in florida .
but drive to baton rouge i did , and was stunned at what i found here : not only electricity and running water , but joggers striding past neatly trimmed lawns .
in two hours i have driven from a war zone to suburban america .
tomorrow i head into the big easy .
gulfport : saturday , 3 september , 2000gmt harrison county 's emergency operations center is becoming more shipshape by the minute - a generator is running power to the building , the outback restaurant has set up a huge grill and is handing out hamburgers and chicken , and men wearing orange harrison county inmate worker t-shirts are busily mopping the floors .
the " inmate workers " are prisoners from the local jail who are helping with disaster relief .
many buildings in gulfport were completely destroyed one of the local sheriff 's deputies told me they were volunteers .
better to be out in the fresh air than locked up inside , he said , but clammed up when i asked more questions .
a moment later , inmate worker steve duke confirmed that he had indeed chosen to help out .
the inmates get time off their sentences for doing community service labour , he said - 30 days ' reduction in sentence for 30 days ' work is the normal trade , but the prisoners are getting unspecified " executive pay " for the disaster relief effort .
but duke was not working to get time off his sentence , he said - he has only 29 days left to serve .
he was doing it because , as he said , " i live here too . "
highway 10 west , mississippi : saturday 1700gmt driving west to see the destruction in bay st louis , a small town near mississippi 's border with louisiana , i picked up a new orleans radio station playing jazz .
not just any old jazz , either , but when the saints go marching in - the signature tune of new orleans jazz - with wailing , screaming horns walking a tightrope between maniacal laughter and uncontrollable tears .
my first thought was that it could be meant as a welcome to the troops who have finally arrived to try to impose some order on the chaotic city .
but listening to those trumpets , i wondered if it was n't a more fundamental cri de coeur , a cry from the heart of the descendants of the original jazzmen who turned their own sorrow , pain and suffering into america 's native music .
gulfport : saturday 1530gmt amid all the destruction of lives , homes , infrastructure and businesses in rural mississippi , some people still have the energy to lament something else katrina took away : the state 's heritage .
kelly robinson , a public information officer with the mississippi emergency management agency , reminded me today that the beachfront was until this week lined with dozens of grand antebellum mansions .
us southerners tell their tales of hurricane survival in pictures " these were 150-to-200-year-old homes .
these old mansions are just gone , nothing left of them but the base . "
oak trees hundreds of years old have been uprooted as well , " plucked like a tulip would be , " she said .
it is not clear that all of the region 's residents will mourn one of the state 's most significant historic sites - the home of jefferson davis , the first and last president of the confederate states of america , which fought the north in the us civil war .
" the slave quarters are gone , " ms robinson said .
" the carriage is lying in a heap of rubble .
it will be a miracle if the house itself is not destroyed .
it 's still standing , but it wo n't be repaired .
" history is gone , " she said .
" history has destroyed history . "
gulfport : saturday 1400gmt for all the talk of help on the way , nothing has changed on the beachfront at gulfport since the storm hit five days ago .
huge lorries meant to haul tropical fruit lie where the storm left them - upturned , worse than useless , now merely rubble to be hauled away themselves .
vehicles lie overturned on the gulfport beachfront and there is more dangerous waste lying on the beach - 40 tons of chicken and a million pounds of shrimp had been sitting in containers on the beach when katrina hit .
they are now scattered across the beachfront , rotting where they lay , a health hazard producing an awful stink .
and they are nearly unrecognisable - though i had been told where to find them , i walked past several before i realised what i was seeing .
my nose found them before my eyes did .
but by far the most unbearable smell comes from a seal , lying on its side and putrefying outside the salmon-coloured copa casino .
there are more humble reminders here , too , of the lives lost and destroyed - a wheelchair sitting abandoned , a videotape of the big bad wolf , the fate of the child who owned it unknown .
biloxi : friday , 2 september , 2330gmt heading back into biloxi to find out what people thought of president bush 's visit today , i saw a fierce sign in front of a house that had been chopped completely in two by a falling tree : you loot ' n ' we shoot .
i wanted to get a picture , but i was n't going to start shooting without permission , so i cautiously pulled into the driveway next door .
as i stepped out of the car , the man in front of the sign turned and reached into his pickup truck .
taking a photo of this sign sparked an angry confrontation i decided a slow , cautious approach would be safer than turning my back , and as luck would have it , when the guy turned back to me , his hands were empty and he was smiling .
i introduced myself and asked if i could take a photo of the sign .
sure , the guy said , my son made it .
but just as i was pulling out my camera , an angry voice behind me called : " hey !
whose truck is this in my driveway ? "
i admitted it was mine and said i 'd only be there for a minute while i took a picture .
" well park it in his driveway ! " she shouted .
" i 'm not telling you to move it - i 'm calling the police ! "
i grabbed a quick shot - for which the man i 'd considered threatening made a peace sign - then scurried back to my vehicle to escape the wrath of the neighbour who turned out to be much fiercer .
i made my way down to the beachfront , where i met a construction worker called ed hess .
deeply tanned , with greying hair reaching down towards his shoulders , he could not have been less moved by george bush 's stop in town .
" you really want to impress me ?
come down here and work with me for a day hauling bricks .
i 've been toting water up nine flights of stairs .
if he could keep up with me , that would impress me - otherwise it 's just talk . "
water park , outside gulfport : friday 1750gmt search and rescue has set up a command post at the water park just outside of gulfport , and it is a hive of activity first thing in the morning - highlighting yet another difference between aid workers , who are busy to the point of exhaustion , and those they have come to rescue , who have little to do but sit and wait .
rescue units have come from as far away as pennsylvania and new york city to aid more local ones from alabama and florida .
no-one here admits it , but hopes of finding trapped survivors must be fading .
col joe spraggins , head of the harrison county emergency management agency , says people can last for five to seven days without food or water , but in this heat that must be optimistic .
and today is officially day four after katrina .
col spraggins says three people were rescued on thursday and 17 corpses were discovered .
so far , search and rescue teams are only following tips from the office of emergency operations , not sweeping wide areas .
gulfport , mississippi : friday 1310gmt gulfport , mississippi , is only a short drive from biloxi , but it feels like a different world .
it was clearly poorer to begin with than biloxi , with its once-attractive seafront historic preservation area of century-old homes .
visitors to gulfport , on the other hand , pass a series of pawnshops , discount stores and offers of cash loans with no credit checks .
now , four days after katrina stomped through , it feels like a curious mixture of ghost town and construction , or deconstruction , site .
military police control traffic at intersections , waving the little civilian traffic past non-working traffic lights , while massive earth-moving vehicles roar along the roads at their lumbering , deliberate pace .
again and again , as i pass buildings smashed into firewood , i have to remind myself that this destruction was a random act of nature , because it looks so much like the product of furious anger .
biloxi , mississippi : thursday , 1 september , 2030gmt mother nature ?
i do n't think so : the nature that tore its way through mississippi 's gulf coast at the beginning of the week was more of a giant , petulant child having a particularly nasty tantrum .
stepping into nothing : little is left standing in parts of biloxi downed trees were the first evidence of the intensity of the storm , from the moment i headed out of mobile .
as i headed towards the town of biloxi , they became more frequent - and were joined by damaged billboards and even the occasional carcass lorries that had been hurled aside like children 's discarded toys .
but , as is often the case with freaks of nature , for every twisted , broken wreck of a billboard , there were half a dozen untouched - many , with cruel irony , advertising the big stars due to perform at the casinos that made biloxi a regional entertainment hub .
somehow , i did n't think merle haggard 's show is going to go on as advertised next week , despite his countenance beaming down along highway 10 .
sally lawson , who worked at one of the largest casinos , confirmed my suspicions as soon as i drove along beach boulevard .
friends of hers had been killed trying to ride out the storm , her daughter was due to give birth at any moment , and she had no idea when she would ever get a pay-cheque again .
petrol station , mobile , alabama : thursday 1540gmt london was revelling in an unexpectedly beautiful late-summer day when i left on wednesday - the parks full of sunbathers , the djs joyously playing in the summertime and a lovely day .
but no sooner was i on the plane to atlanta , georgia , than the mood shifted .
" can i borrow your newspaper ? " a flight attendant asked the man in the seat behind me .
he gave her a blank look .
" i 'm from new orleans , " she said .
his demeanour changed immediately : " of course , " he said .
" take it . "
suddenly the strangers on the plane were a community : " i 'm from new orleans , too . "
where ?
where 's your family ?
are they ok ?
yeah , they made it to atlanta .
they 're in houston .
i 'm from florida , i know what you 're going through .
on the ground in mobile , alabama - about an hour from biloxi , mississippi , one of the worst-affected areas - the mood of solidarity prevails .
there is a sense of solidarity across the affected areas the woman hiring out cars at the airport is hosting a family whose home was destroyed .
warehouse-like supermarkets proudly hoist banners saying : " we 're open . "
and indeed , although the man next to me as we entered the store wondered aloud if there would be any food , the shelves were stocked and the famous southern charm was much in evidence .
every interaction included a question about how my day was going and a genuine-sounding wish that i have a good one .
and on the roads , the drivers are unfailingly polite in their enormous pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles .
even where i am at the moment - in a long queue for petrol .
the woman at the hire-car agency said her husband had waited three hours for fuel yesterday .
at times like these , i 'm grateful for the southern charm , because it 's 90 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 32c -rrb- at 10am .
it 's going to get hotter and stay hot late into the night , and people seem to sense intuitively that politeness is more important than ever .

patrick has a passion for politics and he wants to share it .
to those who consider it " dull and boring " he says nothing could be further from the truth .
" ask people if they are bored by talking about their jobs , their healthcare , their children 's education , transport and housing and they 'll say ' of course not ' . "
blues and bears for patrick in his leisure time patrick is a " long suffering " supporter of birmingham city fc .
he likes to get down to st andrew 's whenever he can to cheer on his beloved blue noses .
during the summer he likes nothing more than to spend a few happy hours at edgbaston watching the bears - that 's warwickshire county cricket club rather than the grizzly kind !
patrick is also a keen aviation enthusiast , theatre and concert-goer and gardener .
michael collie michael was born in london , raised in sheffield and came to the midlands aged 19 .
he 's worked as an auxiliary nurse , a painter and decorator , a motorcycle courier , a steelworker , a stagehand , an actor and an army officer .
his very first job was delivering the news -lrb- on his bike -rrb- , which he still does now -lrb- at a desk -rrb- for bbc midlands today .
michael live on the set michael says his ambition is to own a cadillac hearse -lrb- low mileage , never driven at speed -rrb- .
his most uncomfortable filming location ?
well that would have to be the side of a welsh quarry in a blizzard , for countyfile .
as for the most uncomfortable set to work on .
well , that would have to be the politics show purple chair .
although it is often the political guests who are left feeling decidedly uncomfortable after a grilling from mr collie .
sarah falkland sarah began her journalistic career in newspapers in her native warwickshire and after a spell in bbc local radio she switched to television in 2000 .
she presents and reports for bbc midlands today where she is a regular on the early morning and saturday programmes .
when she 's not presenting sarah can turn her hand to pretty much anything - be it filming and editing her own reports or reporting live on location .
sarah relishes live debate on the political front sarah once found herself having to act as emergency make-up girl to tony blair before a bbc interview where she managed to over-powder the pm 's nose , not to mention forehead , eyebrows and ears .
outside work sarah has an eye for antique furniture and confesses to a fascination with astrology .
any guests to the show may well find themselves being quizzed about their star signs over tea and biscuits after the programme has finished .
susana mendonça susana began her career in journalism with the wanstead & woodford guardian in her home city of london .
she later worked for bbc radio in london , stoke , lincolnshire , essex and birmingham before becoming a tv journalist with bbc south east .
make sure you pronounce her name correctly or you will be in trouble and definitely never ask her if she is spanish !
proud of her heritage for the record mendonsa is the correct way , mendonka or mendoza are definitely incorrect .

patrick has a passion for politics and he wants to share it .

" ask people if they are bored by talking about their jobs , their healthcare , their children 's education , transport and housing and they 'll say ' of course not ' . "
in his leisure time patrick is a " long suffering " supporter of birmingham city fc .
he likes to get down to st andrew 's whenever he can to cheer on his beloved blue noses .
patrick is also a keen aviation enthusiast - or as crueller work colleagues put it , " a plane spotter " .
in weaker moments he will admit that he once dreamed of being an airline pilot .

michael says his ambition is to own a cadillac hearse -lrb- low mileage , never driven at speed -rrb- .

in the summer he can sometimes be spotted at new road , the home of worcestershire ccc .

ian paul editor , politics show south we revel in getting to the heart of the community politics show south takes on board the " your street " end of " from downing street to your street " with a vengeance .
every week we broadcast the entire show from a different location throughout the region .
that might be your local railway station , school , hospital or shopping mall . ... and each week we put the politicians on the spot on their home ground - public accountability at a grass roots level .
because we look at just one story each week , we can get further beneath the skin of an issue than other programmes .
political predictions from the greyhound track in hove the future of regional airports from the departure lounge in southampton airport water shortages from a garden centre near reading disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship personality politics with edwina curry and a tony blair look-alike from the panto stage in worthing homelessness from a shelter in brighton with pop star and big brother contestant preston we reckon that by going out on the streets rather than sitting in the safety and comfort of a tv studio it is much harder for the politicians to duck the issues that matter to all of us who live in those streets .
ian paul , politics show producer ...
ian making sure the show gets on the road ...
ian started his tv career on " nationwide " where one of his first claims to fame was getting lost while taking dennis healey to the studio .
luckily he now spends sundays in a satellite truck with a cable running through to the location , so loses far fewer politicians these days .
peter henley , presenter ...
since the launch of the politics show peter henley has been the man on the spot in the south .
" the programme is a great chance to bring politicians down to earth , " peter says .
" it goes out live and unedited , and we give discussions enough time to really get under the skin of the subject . "
peter got a taste for politics as a radio reporter in the thames valley covering margaret thatcher 's last days as prime minister .
michael heseltine 's campaign to remove his leader was a bruising and bloody affair .
peter takes his politics very seriously ...
" it was an excellent grounding in the true nature of politics , " peter says .
" when the chips are down and backs are against the wall you see where true loyalties lie . "
peter also filmed in saudi arabia during the gulf war of 1992 .
he ca n't forget the tank graveyards - row on row of twisted metal , in which men died .
about politics .
it helps when you have confronted the politicians issuing the orders .
during the kosovo campaign , british troops were facing a ground war when peter went to interview the , then foreign secretary robin cook at chequers .
robin cook broke off to take a telephone call , and returned a different person , having heard the first signs that the serbian regime was caving in .
high politics has its lighter side too .
on the set , or was it game or was it match .. ?
like the time he had to pretend to be the sound man to sneak into an american press conference and ask bill clinton 's right hand woman , madeleine albright , about the embargo on the banana trade .
" we said no questions ! " they yelled .
the secret service piled in , but he got the tape , and her answer , on the air that night !
peter was flamboyant conservative mp boris johnson 's nemesis when he made unguarded comments about the government 's healthy eating plans at the party 's conference .
" my report went around the world , " peter says , " i ended up feeling rather sorry for boris , he was under siege from the media , but it shows how fast a political story can move . "
peter is pleased to be more rooted to home in the new forest with wife sam , who 's a teacher , and their three boys , dog , cat and guinea pig .
the youngest boy , toby , is not so sure .
in order that peter can do radio interviews from home , toby has been pushed out of his bedroom , poor lad !
danielle glavin , reporter ...
undercover griller danielle glavin is our roving reporter always ready to cover the latest hot political topic .
danielle joined us from south today and when the politicians take their holidays you 'll see her back on the daily news .
danielle started her tv career in investigative journalism .
she 's been on undercover stings suited up in a stab vest , or as a cleaner in a hospital and she was kitted out with some gigantic and highly unattractive secret filming glasses to expose dodging dealings at a holiday firm .
so after all of that , grilling politicians should come easily .
just let her know how you want them ... lightly smoked or burnt ?
jo babbage , researcher ...
jo is our researcher - the foundation of solid reporting jo started her career on " city hospital " in the days when it was broadcast live from a truck parked outside southampton general hospital .
she then went on to become weekend producer for bbc radio solent where her job was to persuade the likes of charles kennedy , rik mayall , jon snow and stirling moss that an in depth interview at 9am on a saturday morning is something they 'd really like to do after all !
born and bred in littlehampton , west sussex , she lobbies tirelessly for every edition of the politics show to come from her home town .
maybe one day ...
join peter henley on politics show sundays at midday on bbc one .

ian paul editor , politics show south we revel in getting to the heart of the community politics show south takes on board the " your street " end of " from downing street to your street " with a vengeance .
every week we broadcast the entire show from a different location throughout the region .
that might be your local railway station , school , hospital or shopping mall . ... and each week we put the politicians on the spot on their home ground - public accountability at a grass roots level .
because we look at just one story each week , we can get further beneath the skin of an issue than other programmes .
political predictions from the greyhound track in hove the future of regional airports from the departure lounge in southampton airport water shortages from a garden centre near reading disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship personality politics with edwina curry and a tony blair look-alike from the panto stage in worthing homelessness from a shelter in brighton with pop star and big brother contestant preston we reckon that by going out on the streets rather than sitting in the safety and comfort of a tv studio it is much harder for the politicians to duck the issues that matter to all of us who live in those streets .
ian paul , politics show producer ...
ian making sure the show gets on the road ...
ian started his tv career on " nationwide " where one of his first claims to fame was getting lost while taking dennis healey to the studio .
luckily he now spends sundays in a satellite truck with a cable running through to the location , so loses far fewer politicians these days .
peter henley , presenter ...
since the launch of the politics show peter henley has been the man on the spot in the south .
" the programme is a great chance to bring politicians down to earth , " peter says .
" it goes out live and unedited , and we give discussions enough time to really get under the skin of the subject . "
peter got a taste for politics as a radio reporter in the thames valley covering margaret thatcher 's last days as prime minister .
michael heseltine 's campaign to remove his leader was a bruising and bloody affair .
peter takes his politics very seriously ...
" it was an excellent grounding in the true nature of politics , " peter says .
" when the chips are down and backs are against the wall you see where true loyalties lie . "
peter also filmed in saudi arabia during the gulf war of 1992 .
he ca n't forget the tank graveyards - row on row of twisted metal , in which men died .
about politics .
it helps when you have confronted the politicians issuing the orders .
during the kosovo campaign , british troops were facing a ground war when peter went to interview the , then foreign secretary robin cook at chequers .
robin cook broke off to take a telephone call , and returned a different person , having heard the first signs that the serbian regime was caving in .
high politics has its lighter side too .
on the set , or was it game or was it match .. ?
like the time he had to pretend to be the sound man to sneak into an american press conference and ask bill clinton 's right hand woman , madeleine albright , about the embargo on the banana trade .
" we said no questions ! " they yelled .
the secret service piled in , but he got the tape , and her answer , on the air that night !
peter was flamboyant conservative mp boris johnson 's nemesis when he made unguarded comments about the government 's healthy eating plans at the party 's conference .
" my report went around the world , " peter says , " i ended up feeling rather sorry for boris , he was under siege from the media , but it shows how fast a political story can move . "
peter is pleased to be more rooted to home in the new forest with wife sam , who 's a teacher , and their three boys , dog , cat and guinea pig .
the youngest boy , toby , is not so sure .
in order that peter can do radio interviews from home , toby has been pushed out of his bedroom , poor lad !
danielle glavin , reporter ...
undercover griller danielle glavin is our roving reporter always ready to cover the latest hot political topic .
danielle joined us from south today and when the politicians take their holidays you 'll see her back on the daily news .
danielle started her tv career in investigative journalism .
she 's been on undercover stings suited up in a stab vest , or as a cleaner in a hospital and she was kitted out with some gigantic and highly unattractive secret filming glasses to expose dodging dealings at a holiday firm .
so after all of that , grilling politicians should come easily .
just let her know how you want them ... lightly smoked or burnt ?
jo babbage , researcher ...
jo is our researcher - the foundation of solid reporting jo started her career on " city hospital " in the days when it was broadcast live from a truck parked outside southampton general hospital .
she then went on to become weekend producer for bbc radio solent where her job was to persuade the likes of charles kennedy , rik mayall , jon snow and stirling moss that an in depth interview at 9am on a saturday morning is something they 'd really like to do after all !
born and bred in littlehampton , west sussex , she lobbies tirelessly for every edition of the politics show to come from her home town .

since the launch of the politics show peter henley has been the man on the spot in the south .
" the programme is a great chance to bring politicians down to earth , " peter says .
" it goes out live and unedited , and we give discussions enough time to really get under the skin of the subject . "
peter got a taste for politics as a radio reporter in the thames valley covering margaret thatcher 's last days as prime minister .
michael heseltine 's campaign to remove his leader was a bruising and bloody affair .
peter takes his politics very seriously ...
" it was an excellent grounding in the true nature of politics , " peter says .
" when the chips are down and backs are against the wall you see where true loyalties lie . "

peter was flamboyant conservative mp boris johnson 's nemesis when he made unguarded comments about the government 's healthy eating plans at the party 's conference .
" my report went around the world , " peter says , " i ended up feeling rather sorry for boris , he was under siege from the media , but it shows how fast a political story can move . "
peter is pleased to be more rooted to home in the new forest with wife sam , who 's a teacher , and their three boys , dog , cat and guinea pig .

ian paul editor , politics show south we revel in getting to the heart of the community politics show south takes on board the " your street " end of " from downing street to your street " with a vengeance .
every week we broadcast the entire show from a different location throughout the region .
that might be your local railway station , school , hospital or shopping mall . ... and each week we put the politicians on the spot on their home ground - public accountability at a grass roots level .
because we look at just one story each week , we can get further beneath the skin of an issue than other programmes .
political predictions from the greyhound track in hove the future of regional airports from the departure lounge in southampton airport water shortages from a garden centre near reading disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship disability rights from the deck of a specially-adapted sail training ship personality politics with edwina curry and a tony blair look-alike from the panto stage in worthing homelessness from a shelter in brighton with pop star and big brother contestant preston we reckon that by going out on the streets rather than sitting in the safety and comfort of a tv studio it is much harder for the politicians to duck the issues that matter to all of us who live in those streets .
ian paul , politics show producer ...
ian making sure the show gets on the road ...
ian started his tv career on " nationwide " where one of his first claims to fame was getting lost while taking dennis healey to the studio .
luckily he now spends sundays in a satellite truck with a cable running through to the location , so loses far fewer politicians these days .
peter henley , presenter ...
since the launch of the politics show peter henley has been the man on the spot in the south .
" the programme is a great chance to bring politicians down to earth , " peter says .
" it goes out live and unedited , and we give discussions enough time to really get under the skin of the subject . "
peter got a taste for politics as a radio reporter in the thames valley covering margaret thatcher 's last days as prime minister .
michael heseltine 's campaign to remove his leader was a bruising and bloody affair .
peter takes his politics very seriously ...
" it was an excellent grounding in the true nature of politics , " peter says .
" when the chips are down and backs are against the wall you see where true loyalties lie . "
peter also filmed in saudi arabia during the gulf war of 1992 .
he ca n't forget the tank graveyards - row on row of twisted metal , in which men died .
about politics .
it helps when you have confronted the politicians issuing the orders .
during the kosovo campaign , british troops were facing a ground war when peter went to interview the , then foreign secretary robin cook at chequers .
robin cook broke off to take a telephone call , and returned a different person , having heard the first signs that the serbian regime was caving in .
high politics has its lighter side too .
on the set , or was it game or was it match .. ?
like the time he had to pretend to be the sound man to sneak into an american press conference and ask bill clinton 's right hand woman , madeleine albright , about the embargo on the banana trade .
" we said no questions ! " they yelled .
the secret service piled in , but he got the tape , and her answer , on the air that night !
peter was flamboyant conservative mp boris johnson 's nemesis when he made unguarded comments about the government 's healthy eating plans at the party 's conference .
" my report went around the world , " peter says , " i ended up feeling rather sorry for boris , he was under siege from the media , but it shows how fast a political story can move . "
peter is pleased to be more rooted to home in the new forest with wife sam , who 's a teacher , and their three boys , dog , cat and guinea pig .
the youngest boy , toby , is not so sure .
in order that peter can do radio interviews from home , toby has been pushed out of his bedroom , poor lad !
danielle glavin , reporter ...
undercover griller danielle glavin is our roving reporter always ready to cover the latest hot political topic .
danielle joined us from south today and when the politicians take their holidays you 'll see her back on the daily news .
danielle started her tv career in investigative journalism .
she 's been on undercover stings suited up in a stab vest , or as a cleaner in a hospital and she was kitted out with some gigantic and highly unattractive secret filming glasses to expose dodging dealings at a holiday firm .
so after all of that , grilling politicians should come easily .
just let her know how you want them ... lightly smoked or burnt ?
jo babbage , researcher ...
jo is our researcher - the foundation of solid reporting jo started her career on " city hospital " in the days when it was broadcast live from a truck parked outside southampton general hospital .
she then went on to become weekend producer for bbc radio solent where her job was to persuade the likes of charles kennedy , rik mayall , jon snow and stirling moss that an in depth interview at 9am on a saturday morning is something they 'd really like to do after all !
born and bred in littlehampton , west sussex , she lobbies tirelessly for every edition of the politics show to come from her home town .

" it goes out live and unedited , and we give discussions enough time to really get under the skin of the subject . "
peter got a taste for politics as a radio reporter in the thames valley covering margaret thatcher 's last days as prime minister .
michael heseltine 's campaign to remove his leader was a bruising and bloody affair .
peter takes his politics very seriously ...
" it was an excellent grounding in the true nature of politics , " peter says .
" when the chips are down and backs are against the wall you see where true loyalties lie . "
peter also filmed in saudi arabia during the gulf war of 1992 .
he ca n't forget the tank graveyards - row on row of twisted metal , in which men died .
about politics .
it helps when you have confronted the politicians issuing the orders .
during the kosovo campaign , british troops were facing a ground war when peter went to interview the , then foreign secretary robin cook at chequers .
robin cook broke off to take a telephone call , and returned a different person , having heard the first signs that the serbian regime was caving in .
high politics has its lighter side too .
on the set , or was it game or was it match .. ?
like the time he had to pretend to be the sound man to sneak into an american press conference and ask bill clinton 's right hand woman , madeleine albright , about the embargo on the banana trade .
" we said no questions ! " they yelled .
the secret service piled in , but he got the tape , and her answer , on the air that night !
peter was flamboyant conservative mp boris johnson 's nemesis when he made unguarded comments about the government 's healthy eating plans at the party 's conference .
" my report went around the world , " peter says , " i ended up feeling rather sorry for boris , he was under siege from the media , but it shows how fast a political story can move . "
peter is pleased to be more rooted to home in the new forest with wife sam , who 's a teacher , and their three boys , dog , cat and guinea pig .
the youngest boy , toby , is not so sure .
in order that peter can do radio interviews from home , toby has been pushed out of his bedroom , poor lad !
