26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

" things are improving .
the backlog is starting to clear , " michael elmquist , the chief of the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , told afp . the united states said it would deploy up to 1,500 marines for tsunami relief in sri lanka after sending 17 navy helicopters to aceh , some of which were swarmed by hungry survivors . " it 's absolutely life saving , " elmquist said of the us mission in aceh .
" we are absolutely thrilled that americans are doing that .
they are the only ones who have the capacity to reach those parts of the population right now . " ahead of a crisis summit in the indonesian capital jakarta on thursday , countries rushed to top each other 's pledges with japan offering $ 500 million -lrb- € 370 million -rrb- to tsunami victims and taiwan raising its contribution to $ 50 million , bringing the total above $ 2 billion .

but the massive scale of the human tragedy remains daunting and un secretary general kofi annan said it could take five to 10 years to reconstruct from the titanic wall of water that tore apart the indian ocean coastlines on dec .
26 . in aceh , which was closest to the epicenter of the deep-sea quake which registered 9.0 on the richter scale , volunteers desperately tried to bury thousands of corpses rotting in tropical temperatures in hopes of curbing the spread of disease . agoes kooshartoro , who leads about 100 indonesian red crescent volunteers in aceh , said many people were suffering disease , particularly of the lungs , after the tsunamis swept away the sanitation infrastructure . " over the past five days many people have died because of this .
they survived the waves , but they died of infections and breathing failure .
there are many stories like that and we have seen such incidents , " he said . the world health organization said it was also seeing growing reports of potentially deadly diarrhea outbreaks in displacement camps in sri lanka and india . " it needs a few more days before we can state that we are confident that we 've been able to avoid major outbreaks of disease , " david nabarro , the top who official dealing with humanitarian crises , told reporters in geneva .
" you have serious water-carrying diseases such as dysentery as a ticking time bomb , " said jorgen poulsen , chief of the danish red cross in banda aceh .
" we hope we can avoid cholera .
the problem is we have already seen people vomiting in town . "
relief effort divisive us secretary of state colin powell is due to head to the region to take part in the jakarta disaster relief summit which will also include annan , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and australian prime minister john howard .
but prime minister thaksin shinawatra of thailand , another hard-hit country , said sunday without explanation that he may not attend the jakarta summit as he went on a new tour of the devastated resort island of phuket . france , meanwhile , said it would coordinate all european relief efforts for the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : soldiers line up to unload relief supplies from a cargo plane in banda aceh saturday . annan , speaking on the us network abc , said he had not spoken since the disaster to us president george w. bush amid speculation of a rift over whether the un or washington would spearhead the monumental aid effort . " i 've spoken to other leaders around the world , including the chinese , and they all want to accept the un leadership and they want to work with us , " annan said .
" this is the largest disaster we have had to deal with , " annan said , underlining " the sheer complexity " of the relief effort spread over a dozen nations .
searching continues sri lanka said it had confirmed 29,729 dead from the tidal waves , while more than 16,000 people were injured .
in thailand the death toll was sunday revised down slightly to 4,798 as several bodies had been double counted .
some 2,402 foreigners were listed among those who died , official data showed .
the exact toll , however , will likely never be known , with the united nations saying the number of people killed may be around 150,000 . " we will continue to search for the dead and bury them as well as to search for any survivors - no matter how slim the chances are of still finding a survivor , " said basuki , the indonesian colonel . bildunterschrift : residents reach out for food packets being distributed by a group of businessmen from bangalore in nagappattinam , india . on the ground in thailand , teams began the macabre process of taking samples from the bodies which have been collected from the destroyed beaches and buildings .

the a.f. raymond funeral undertakers said out of the 89 bodies brought to them , 32 were positively identified and repatriated or cremated here according to the wishes of the next of kin . " there are forensic teams from almost all european nations taking dna samples and copies of dental structures , " aubrey raymond told afp .
" among the unidentified bodies are six children not more than five years -lrb- old -rrb- . " relief operations were particularly difficult in the eastern sri lankan area of ampara where flash floods saturday displaced another 30,000 people in a district where 160,000 people were already displaced by the tsunamis .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

" things are improving .
the backlog is starting to clear , " michael elmquist , the chief of the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , told afp . the united states said it would deploy up to 1,500 marines for tsunami relief in sri lanka after sending 17 navy helicopters to aceh , some of which were swarmed by hungry survivors . " it 's absolutely life saving , " elmquist said of the us mission in aceh .
" we are absolutely thrilled that americans are doing that .
they are the only ones who have the capacity to reach those parts of the population right now .

there are many stories like that and we have seen such incidents , " he said . the world health organization said it was also seeing growing reports of potentially deadly diarrhea outbreaks in displacement camps in sri lanka and india . " it needs a few more days before we can state that we are confident that we 've been able to avoid major outbreaks of disease , " david nabarro , the top who official dealing with humanitarian crises , told reporters in geneva .

the exact toll , however , will likely never be known , with the united nations saying the number of people killed may be around 150,000 .

construction workers , too , have a good prospects abroad .
in france , for example , experience counts more than age . these days , employment specialists say life-long learning , mobility , and intercultural competence are essential qualifications for job seeker . but hans-christian wolf does n't have a college degree , and he 's never taken a single business trip .
what he has done , however , is to take the " success principle " seriously .
in his late forties , the man from the depressed industrial city of duisburg packed his bags and moved to where the work was waiting for him : in the southern french town of fos-sur-mer . ' work is important ' wolf is a trained falsework setter , building supports to carry a structure as it is being built .
up to now , he spent his life pouring concrete foundations in his native ruhr valley .
he never dreamed of working abroad .
but economic realities forced him to it . " it is important to work , " said wolf pragmatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scaffold builders are especially sought after .
he was jobless for six months when a job offer at a german-french employment agency , ecc france , came to his attention .
he applied , took a french course in duisburg , and got the job from the french employer . ecc france specializes in placing german construction workers in french jobs . filling a gap " in france , this area is short around 300,000 specialists , " said christine zahn , who runs the agency .
masons and carpenters are especially easy to place .
the country also lacks scaffolding builders , falsework setters like wolf and gas-water installers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris of collapsed passenger terminal at charles de gaulle airport , paris .
in recent years , france has had to deal with a number of construction scandals .
the best-known involved the collapse of the roof of one of the terminals of paris ' charles de gaulle airport . french politicians are trying to lure youths into learning the construction trade in order to close the gap in the need for trade specialists , but with little success . " they all would rather work in chic offices .
they do n't want to get their hands dirty , " zahn said . " it really is an opportunity for the many german craftsmen who are out of work .
especially in eastern germany , there are so many experienced building specialists who are out of work . " easterners well suited ecc france has had especially good experience in placing eastern germans in jobs .
because they have so few options , they are especially flexible , mobile and do n't demand excessive pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in eastern germany , construction workers have a hard time finding jobs .
germany 's international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- placed more than 2,500 craftsmen from the building industry in 2004 .
overall , zav placed more than 4,000 german jobless in neighboring countries .
miguel peromingo is the coordinator for european employment services at the bonn-based zav .
he combs foreign newspapers for job descriptions and makes contact with employers . positive experience sending germans to austria and the netherlands is especially easy because there is no language barrier , says peromingo .
-lrb- the dutch and german languages have many similarities , and many dutch speak german well . -rrb-
but workers have shown themselves to be ready to learn a new language . peromingo describes his experience placing german construction workers abroad as quite positive .
for one thing , in other countries , people who would be considered " too old " for the job often get another chance .
" outside germany , qualification and experience still count more than they do here , " he said .
" here , the age of a job seeker is often the most important criterion .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

" things are improving .
the backlog is starting to clear , " michael elmquist , the chief of the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , told afp . the united states said it would deploy up to 1,500 marines for tsunami relief in sri lanka after sending 17 navy helicopters to aceh , some of which were swarmed by hungry survivors . " it 's absolutely life saving , " elmquist said of the us mission in aceh .
" we are absolutely thrilled that americans are doing that .
they are the only ones who have the capacity to reach those parts of the population right now . " ahead of a crisis summit in the indonesian capital jakarta on thursday , countries rushed to top each other 's pledges with japan offering $ 500 million -lrb- € 370 million -rrb- to tsunami victims and taiwan raising its contribution to $ 50 million , bringing the total above $ 2 billion .
5-10 year setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai in the rebel-controlled northern part of sri lanka .
but the massive scale of the human tragedy remains daunting and un secretary general kofi annan said it could take five to 10 years to reconstruct from the titanic wall of water that tore apart the indian ocean coastlines on dec .
26 . in aceh , which was closest to the epicenter of the deep-sea quake which registered 9.0 on the richter scale , volunteers desperately tried to bury thousands of corpses rotting in tropical temperatures in hopes of curbing the spread of disease . agoes kooshartoro , who leads about 100 indonesian red crescent volunteers in aceh , said many people were suffering disease , particularly of the lungs , after the tsunamis swept away the sanitation infrastructure . " over the past five days many people have died because of this .
they survived the waves , but they died of infections and breathing failure .
there are many stories like that and we have seen such incidents , " he said . the world health organization said it was also seeing growing reports of potentially deadly diarrhea outbreaks in displacement camps in sri lanka and india . " it needs a few more days before we can state that we are confident that we 've been able to avoid major outbreaks of disease , " david nabarro , the top who official dealing with humanitarian crises , told reporters in geneva .
" you have serious water-carrying diseases such as dysentery as a ticking time bomb , " said jorgen poulsen , chief of the danish red cross in banda aceh .
" we hope we can avoid cholera .
the problem is we have already seen people vomiting in town . "
relief effort divisive us secretary of state colin powell is due to head to the region to take part in the jakarta disaster relief summit which will also include annan , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and australian prime minister john howard .
but prime minister thaksin shinawatra of thailand , another hard-hit country , said sunday without explanation that he may not attend the jakarta summit as he went on a new tour of the devastated resort island of phuket . france , meanwhile , said it would coordinate all european relief efforts for the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : soldiers line up to unload relief supplies from a cargo plane in banda aceh saturday . annan , speaking on the us network abc , said he had not spoken since the disaster to us president george w. bush amid speculation of a rift over whether the un or washington would spearhead the monumental aid effort . " i 've spoken to other leaders around the world , including the chinese , and they all want to accept the un leadership and they want to work with us , " annan said .
" this is the largest disaster we have had to deal with , " annan said , underlining " the sheer complexity " of the relief effort spread over a dozen nations .
searching continues sri lanka said it had confirmed 29,729 dead from the tidal waves , while more than 16,000 people were injured .
in thailand the death toll was sunday revised down slightly to 4,798 as several bodies had been double counted .
some 2,402 foreigners were listed among those who died , official data showed .
the exact toll , however , will likely never be known , with the united nations saying the number of people killed may be around 150,000 . " we will continue to search for the dead and bury them as well as to search for any survivors - no matter how slim the chances are of still finding a survivor , " said basuki , the indonesian colonel . bildunterschrift : residents reach out for food packets being distributed by a group of businessmen from bangalore in nagappattinam , india . on the ground in thailand , teams began the macabre process of taking samples from the bodies which have been collected from the destroyed beaches and buildings .
teeth are removed so they can be compared to the victim 's dental x-rays while a small piece of the body 's femur bone is also taken for dna testing - a service china has offered to provide for free . medical teams from britain , france , germany , portugal , austria , italy , the netherlands and belgian were struggling to identify 57 corpses of foreign nationals in sri lanka .
the a.f. raymond funeral undertakers said out of the 89 bodies brought to them , 32 were positively identified and repatriated or cremated here according to the wishes of the next of kin . " there are forensic teams from almost all european nations taking dna samples and copies of dental structures , " aubrey raymond told afp .
" among the unidentified bodies are six children not more than five years -lrb- old -rrb- . " relief operations were particularly difficult in the eastern sri lankan area of ampara where flash floods saturday displaced another 30,000 people in a district where 160,000 people were already displaced by the tsunamis .

" things are improving .
the backlog is starting to clear , " michael elmquist , the chief of the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , told afp . the united states said it would deploy up to 1,500 marines for tsunami relief in sri lanka after sending 17 navy helicopters to aceh , some of which were swarmed by hungry survivors . " it 's absolutely life saving , " elmquist said of the us mission in aceh .
" we are absolutely thrilled that americans are doing that .
they are the only ones who have the capacity to reach those parts of the population right now .

they survived the waves , but they died of infections and breathing failure .
there are many stories like that and we have seen such incidents , " he said . the world health organization said it was also seeing growing reports of potentially deadly diarrhea outbreaks in displacement camps in sri lanka and india . " it needs a few more days before we can state that we are confident that we 've been able to avoid major outbreaks of disease , " david nabarro , the top who official dealing with humanitarian crises , told reporters in geneva .

the exact toll , however , will likely never be known , with the united nations saying the number of people killed may be around 150,000 .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

2 , 2004 -rrb- schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships chancellor gerhard schröder has used his annual new year 's speech to widen his appeal for debt reduction in the indian ocean countries devastated by sunday 's earthquake and tsunami .
-lrb- dec .
31 , 2004 -rrb- south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

construction workers , too , have a good prospects abroad .
in france , for example , experience counts more than age . these days , employment specialists say life-long learning , mobility , and intercultural competence are essential qualifications for job seeker . but hans-christian wolf does n't have a college degree , and he 's never taken a single business trip .
what he has done , however , is to take the " success principle " seriously .
in his late forties , the man from the depressed industrial city of duisburg packed his bags and moved to where the work was waiting for him : in the southern french town of fos-sur-mer . ' work is important ' wolf is a trained falsework setter , building supports to carry a structure as it is being built .
up to now , he spent his life pouring concrete foundations in his native ruhr valley .
he never dreamed of working abroad .
but economic realities forced him to it . " it is important to work , " said wolf pragmatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scaffold builders are especially sought after .
he was jobless for six months when a job offer at a german-french employment agency , ecc france , came to his attention .
he applied , took a french course in duisburg , and got the job from the french employer . ecc france specializes in placing german construction workers in french jobs . filling a gap " in france , this area is short around 300,000 specialists , " said christine zahn , who runs the agency .
masons and carpenters are especially easy to place .
the country also lacks scaffolding builders , falsework setters like wolf and gas-water installers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris of collapsed passenger terminal at charles de gaulle airport , paris .
in recent years , france has had to deal with a number of construction scandals .
the best-known involved the collapse of the roof of one of the terminals of paris ' charles de gaulle airport . french politicians are trying to lure youths into learning the construction trade in order to close the gap in the need for trade specialists , but with little success . " they all would rather work in chic offices .
they do n't want to get their hands dirty , " zahn said . " it really is an opportunity for the many german craftsmen who are out of work .
especially in eastern germany , there are so many experienced building specialists who are out of work . " easterners well suited ecc france has had especially good experience in placing eastern germans in jobs .
because they have so few options , they are especially flexible , mobile and do n't demand excessive pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in eastern germany , construction workers have a hard time finding jobs .
germany 's international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- placed more than 2,500 craftsmen from the building industry in 2004 .
overall , zav placed more than 4,000 german jobless in neighboring countries .
miguel peromingo is the coordinator for european employment services at the bonn-based zav .
he combs foreign newspapers for job descriptions and makes contact with employers . positive experience sending germans to austria and the netherlands is especially easy because there is no language barrier , says peromingo .
-lrb- the dutch and german languages have many similarities , and many dutch speak german well . -rrb-
but workers have shown themselves to be ready to learn a new language . peromingo describes his experience placing german construction workers abroad as quite positive .
for one thing , in other countries , people who would be considered " too old " for the job often get another chance .
" outside germany , qualification and experience still count more than they do here , " he said .
" here , the age of a job seeker is often the most important criterion .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

construction workers , too , have a good prospects abroad .
in france , for example , experience counts more than age . these days , employment specialists say life-long learning , mobility , and intercultural competence are essential qualifications for job seeker . but hans-christian wolf does n't have a college degree , and he 's never taken a single business trip .
what he has done , however , is to take the " success principle " seriously .
in his late forties , the man from the depressed industrial city of duisburg packed his bags and moved to where the work was waiting for him : in the southern french town of fos-sur-mer . ' work is important ' wolf is a trained falsework setter , building supports to carry a structure as it is being built .
up to now , he spent his life pouring concrete foundations in his native ruhr valley .
he never dreamed of working abroad .
but economic realities forced him to it . " it is important to work , " said wolf pragmatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scaffold builders are especially sought after .
he was jobless for six months when a job offer at a german-french employment agency , ecc france , came to his attention .
he applied , took a french course in duisburg , and got the job from the french employer . ecc france specializes in placing german construction workers in french jobs . filling a gap " in france , this area is short around 300,000 specialists , " said christine zahn , who runs the agency .
masons and carpenters are especially easy to place .
the country also lacks scaffolding builders , falsework setters like wolf and gas-water installers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris of collapsed passenger terminal at charles de gaulle airport , paris .
in recent years , france has had to deal with a number of construction scandals .
the best-known involved the collapse of the roof of one of the terminals of paris ' charles de gaulle airport . french politicians are trying to lure youths into learning the construction trade in order to close the gap in the need for trade specialists , but with little success . " they all would rather work in chic offices .
they do n't want to get their hands dirty , " zahn said . " it really is an opportunity for the many german craftsmen who are out of work .
especially in eastern germany , there are so many experienced building specialists who are out of work . " easterners well suited ecc france has had especially good experience in placing eastern germans in jobs .
because they have so few options , they are especially flexible , mobile and do n't demand excessive pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in eastern germany , construction workers have a hard time finding jobs .
germany 's international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- placed more than 2,500 craftsmen from the building industry in 2004 .
overall , zav placed more than 4,000 german jobless in neighboring countries .
miguel peromingo is the coordinator for european employment services at the bonn-based zav .
he combs foreign newspapers for job descriptions and makes contact with employers . positive experience sending germans to austria and the netherlands is especially easy because there is no language barrier , says peromingo .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .
his call for donations and his words of commiseration are clear signs to the people in the region that germany aims to do everything it can to help on-site .
at the same time , the government is trying to bring german vacationers home with as little bureaucracy as possible .
inscrutable complaints thus , it is all the more baffling that some german tourists complain about lost luggage and lack of attention from german travel companies .
in the face of immeasurable suffering in the region , such egoistic behavior is absolutely cynical .
schröder was spot on when he pointed out that compared to the states affected by the flooding germany is a " very , very rich country . " bildunterschrift : sri lankan refugees scramble on a truck to receive supplies in matara , south of colombo , on sunday . luckily , there are also grateful german vacationers who know to appreciate the generous help they have received from local people during these desperate times . the german government will have to devote special attention to those german families that have lost parents , children or siblings .
hundreds of cases are still unresolved , and many people in germany continue to fear for the lives of their relatives . when the affected countries have again disappeared from the headlines , the aid that 's now coming must continue to do so .
for , it 's indisputable that europe is only showing so much sympathy because the vacation destinations of affluent european tourists have been affected . but we europeans , who have for years have spent our holidays there , also share responsibility for the region .
one thing has become very clear due to the catastrophe : in the global village , we 've all become neighbors . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

what he has done , however , is to take the " success principle " seriously .

they do n't want to get their hands dirty , " zahn said . " it really is an opportunity for the many german craftsmen who are out of work .
especially in eastern germany , there are so many experienced building specialists who are out of work . " easterners well suited ecc france has had especially good experience in placing eastern germans in jobs .

construction workers , too , have a good prospects abroad .
in france , for example , experience counts more than age . these days , employment specialists say life-long learning , mobility , and intercultural competence are essential qualifications for job seeker . but hans-christian wolf does n't have a college degree , and he 's never taken a single business trip .
what he has done , however , is to take the " success principle " seriously .
in his late forties , the man from the depressed industrial city of duisburg packed his bags and moved to where the work was waiting for him : in the southern french town of fos-sur-mer . ' work is important ' wolf is a trained falsework setter , building supports to carry a structure as it is being built .
up to now , he spent his life pouring concrete foundations in his native ruhr valley .
he never dreamed of working abroad .
but economic realities forced him to it . " it is important to work , " said wolf pragmatically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scaffold builders are especially sought after .
he was jobless for six months when a job offer at a german-french employment agency , ecc france , came to his attention .
he applied , took a french course in duisburg , and got the job from the french employer . ecc france specializes in placing german construction workers in french jobs . filling a gap " in france , this area is short around 300,000 specialists , " said christine zahn , who runs the agency .
masons and carpenters are especially easy to place .
the country also lacks scaffolding builders , falsework setters like wolf and gas-water installers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris of collapsed passenger terminal at charles de gaulle airport , paris .
in recent years , france has had to deal with a number of construction scandals .
the best-known involved the collapse of the roof of one of the terminals of paris ' charles de gaulle airport . french politicians are trying to lure youths into learning the construction trade in order to close the gap in the need for trade specialists , but with little success . " they all would rather work in chic offices .
they do n't want to get their hands dirty , " zahn said . " it really is an opportunity for the many german craftsmen who are out of work .
especially in eastern germany , there are so many experienced building specialists who are out of work . " easterners well suited ecc france has had especially good experience in placing eastern germans in jobs .
because they have so few options , they are especially flexible , mobile and do n't demand excessive pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in eastern germany , construction workers have a hard time finding jobs .
germany 's international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- placed more than 2,500 craftsmen from the building industry in 2004 .
overall , zav placed more than 4,000 german jobless in neighboring countries .
miguel peromingo is the coordinator for european employment services at the bonn-based zav .
he combs foreign newspapers for job descriptions and makes contact with employers . positive experience sending germans to austria and the netherlands is especially easy because there is no language barrier , says peromingo .
-lrb- the dutch and german languages have many similarities , and many dutch speak german well . -rrb-
but workers have shown themselves to be ready to learn a new language . peromingo describes his experience placing german construction workers abroad as quite positive .
for one thing , in other countries , people who would be considered " too old " for the job often get another chance .
" outside germany , qualification and experience still count more than they do here , " he said .
" here , the age of a job seeker is often the most important criterion .

26 have mobilized worldwide aid .
but worries about one 's own tourists must not overshadow the suffering of local people . as the death toll rises daily , the disaster in south asia is truly global and its magnitude may be much worse than we can now estimate .
thousands of people remain missing and the threat looms that disease and epidemics will breakout . but the world is closing ranks due to the dimension of this apocalypse .
the wave of helpfulness stretches across the planet and provides comfort in the midst of nearly incomprehensible devastation . aid from germany also came quickly .
crisis management on the part of the government worked without a hitch .
german chancellor gerhard schröder made available € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in immediate aid and said he would lobby for a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia .

louis barratt mullan , 16 , and his brother theo , 12 , were on a takua pa beach in when waves hit on boxing day .
their parents , leonard barratt , 49 , and catherine mullan , 53 , from grampound near truro , cornwall are presumed dead .

the boys ' aunt joy flew to bangkok to meet louis and theo , who have been staying with a family arranged by the british embassy .
their uncle , nick , who was reunited with they boys on saturday night , told bbc news the family was facing up to the reality that the couple might not be found alive .
louis had described the tsunami as " like a giant washing machine " in a telephone call from thailand to reassure his grandmother he and his brother were alive .
he said : " there is still a slight hope that they might turn up .
" but the second phone call from louis really made us all think that we had to realistically face the worst case scenario because of the time scale involved and the fact that they were all together on that beach and theo and louis were found . "
he said : " they seem well physically and they certainly seem to be coping astonishingly well at the moment . "
joy told how they had survived the experience .
she said : " the four of them were on the beach and len suddenly spotted something , and he just said to the boys , ' run back to the beach hut and lock yourselves in . '
