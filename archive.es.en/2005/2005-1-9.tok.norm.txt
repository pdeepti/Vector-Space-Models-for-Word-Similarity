throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .
cultural riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical sorb easter eggs , intricately hand-painted all the more so against the background of efforts to create a common home in europe , where , as leos shatava from the sorbic institute believes , the emphasis is very much on shared values rather than on differences .
" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .
cultural riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical sorb easter eggs , intricately hand-painted all the more so against the background of efforts to create a common home in europe , where , as leos shatava from the sorbic institute believes , the emphasis is very much on shared values rather than on differences .
" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .

on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .

the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.01.2005 life improves for romanian germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans first came as guest workers to romania around 1150 of the hundreds of thousands of germans who once lived in romania , only 60,000 remain .
and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .
and continental is not alone .
siemens , daimler , steilmann textile group and many other large german companies have already made substantial investments in romania . still , most of the romanian germans have stayed in germany .
but they visit their former home increasingly .
popa , for his part , does n't regret having stayed in romania . " i can say i 'm a winner , " he said .
" business is going well .
i 'm quite satisfied .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .

it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .

" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .
and continental is not alone .
siemens , daimler , steilmann textile group and many other large german companies have already made substantial investments in romania . still , most of the romanian germans have stayed in germany .
but they visit their former home increasingly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2005 germany 's struggling ethnic minority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional costume is just one feature of the sorb national identity on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival . the sorbs have been living around the banks of the rivers elbe and spree for about 1,500 years , and although they are divided into two major groups which differ decidedly in both language and customs , they have survived together as germany ’ s only ethnic minority .
throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .

" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .

" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.01.2005 life improves for romanian germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans first came as guest workers to romania around 1150 of the hundreds of thousands of germans who once lived in romania , only 60,000 remain .
and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .
and continental is not alone .
siemens , daimler , steilmann textile group and many other large german companies have already made substantial investments in romania . still , most of the romanian germans have stayed in germany .
but they visit their former home increasingly .
popa , for his part , does n't regret having stayed in romania . " i can say i 'm a winner , " he said .
" business is going well .
i 'm quite satisfied .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .

" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2005 germany 's struggling ethnic minority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional costume is just one feature of the sorb national identity on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival . the sorbs have been living around the banks of the rivers elbe and spree for about 1,500 years , and although they are divided into two major groups which differ decidedly in both language and customs , they have survived together as germany ’ s only ethnic minority .
throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .
cultural riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical sorb easter eggs , intricately hand-painted all the more so against the background of efforts to create a common home in europe , where , as leos shatava from the sorbic institute believes , the emphasis is very much on shared values rather than on differences .
" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .
and continental is not alone .
siemens , daimler , steilmann textile group and many other large german companies have already made substantial investments in romania . still , most of the romanian germans have stayed in germany .
but they visit their former home increasingly .
popa , for his part , does n't regret having stayed in romania . " i can say i 'm a winner , " he said .

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .

the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .

german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .

and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "

not anymore .
german texts are finding their own niche in pop , even among bands that come from sweden , poland or the us .
or when argentina is on the tour schedule . the punk rockers that make up the band " die toten hosen " can easily pack out even the biggest concert halls in buenos aires .
" and ' in extremo ' - they do german hard rock , and are invited to play shows in mexico , " said björn akstinat , the director of the german music export office helps german bands to market themselves abroad .
but that also means doing a bit of public relations work here at home , he added .
" the world loves german music , " he said .
" the germans just do n't know it . "
the language of hard rock after all , it 's not as if no one outside of germany understands german .
" a survey we did found that , in the us alone , there are six million people who speak german , " said tobias mindner of the verein für deutsche sprache , an organization for the protection of the german language .
" german is much more significant than we think . "
in serbia , for example , the band " kraljevski apartman " produces hard rock with german lyrics .
" in scandinavia , german is widely used in the hard rock and heavy metal scene , because it 's such a powerful language , " mindner said .
the swedish band " covenant " even produced its entire album " future-pop " in german .
the reason ?
" germany is our biggest market , and many germans find it difficult to understand english texts , " according to the band .
eastward expansion in eastern europe , german texts are becoming more and more popular , and not just because of the already-mentioned " kraljevski apartman . "
the romanian rockers " ricochee " recorded an entire album in german - to " keep alive the german influence on the transylvanian culture , " as they say .
in slovenia , " sestre " sings in german , and in poland , " ich troje " even entered a song with german lyrics in the 2003 eurovision song contest .
" in warsaw , german folk singers from the 1960 's are trendy , " mindner said .
" there are even dedicated radio stations for this music . "
catchy tunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena enjoyed a lucky break in the us in the 1980s akstinat stressed though that it 's not just the text that makes german music popular .
" a lot depends on the melody , of course , " he said .
" and on the show .
' rammstein ' uses a lot of pyrotechnics , and ' in extremo ' uses these instruments from the middle ages . "
and what about nena , who became popular in the us during the 1980 's ?
" she was lucky , " akstinat said .
" a dj brought her record to the us from germany and just took a chance and played it .

and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .

formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .

and they are experiencing a sort of renaissance . most of romania 's ethnic germans immigrated to their ancestors ' homeland during communist leader nicolai ceascescu 's reign .
but since the romanian people toppled the dictator in 1989 , some of the romanian germans have moved back and taken part in the country 's economic revival . gigi popa and hermann kurmes , both romanian germans , grew up together in vulcan , a small village near the carpathian mountains , and now live in the southeastern transylvanian town zarnesti .
kurmes left romania decades ago for germany and worked there as a teacher .
popa stayed at home , despite the harassment that ethnic germans were often subjected to . it 's not that popa did n't consider emigrating .
but it was n't that easy . " first they kicked you out of your job , if you had a decent job .
it was a big risk , " he told bavarian public broadcaster br . but after the dictatorship was overthrown and the country started developing a parliamentary democracy and a free market , popa did n't see the point in leaving anymore . " there was nothing here , " he said .
" you have all the opportunities here , even now you can do very , very much .
as a businessman , a competent businessman , one can get rich in romania . "
romanian germans thriving both popa and kurmes have taken advantage of the opportunities and business is going well .
popa runs a guesthouse , and kurmes opened a travel agency after returning from germany . they are n't the only romanian germans who have profited .
contacts to germany are good for business , and , in contrast to many ethnic germans from the former soviet union , romanian germans normally speak the language fluently . sibiu , the transylvanian city of 160,000 , is booming .
formerly the romanian-german capital , only 3,000 of them now live in hermannstadt , as germans call sibiu .
and many people credit them with contributing vastly to the city 's economic fortunes .
their relations to germany have given them a good reputation at home .
that their standing has improved in romanian society is perhaps best illustrated by fact that a romanian german has been elected mayor by a large majority of sibiu 's voters .
german investment german tire maker continental plans to set up a development center in sibiu , and it 's already started supporting engineering students at the local university .
and continental is not alone .
siemens , daimler , steilmann textile group and many other large german companies have already made substantial investments in romania . still , most of the romanian germans have stayed in germany .
but they visit their former home increasingly .
popa , for his part , does n't regret having stayed in romania . " i can say i 'm a winner , " he said .
" business is going well .
i 'm quite satisfied .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2005 germany 's struggling ethnic minority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional costume is just one feature of the sorb national identity on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival . the sorbs have been living around the banks of the rivers elbe and spree for about 1,500 years , and although they are divided into two major groups which differ decidedly in both language and customs , they have survived together as germany ’ s only ethnic minority .
throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .
cultural riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical sorb easter eggs , intricately hand-painted all the more so against the background of efforts to create a common home in europe , where , as leos shatava from the sorbic institute believes , the emphasis is very much on shared values rather than on differences .
" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .

" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2005 germany 's struggling ethnic minority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional costume is just one feature of the sorb national identity on a modest stretch of land in germany 's east saxony and south brandenburg regions , a tiny slavonic nation continues to fight its corner for cultural recognition and " sorb " survival . the sorbs have been living around the banks of the rivers elbe and spree for about 1,500 years , and although they are divided into two major groups which differ decidedly in both language and customs , they have survived together as germany ’ s only ethnic minority .
throughout the centuries , the sorbs with their heart-felt love for the country they live in have become rapidly germanised , and yet their resistance to full assimilation has ensured their continued survival as an ethnic minority .
in the city of bautzen , 4,000 of the 43,000 inhabitants belong to germany ’ s only national minority .
jurij wuschansky from the association of sorbs and sorbian association domowina says that people from other european minorities are particularly appreciative of the fact that germans and sorbs live together on equal terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on special occasions , young girls also wear their traditional dress " they say , it ’ s great what you have achieved and how tolerant the germans are to you .
they envy and admire us , " wuschansky said .
" we ’ re an exception in europe apart from minorities in two areas in france .
in our town hall , for example , all signs at public offices are in german and sorbian . " the sorb culture is also evident in the traditional costumes which are still a part of daily life for many elderly women in the region .
constitutional rights in the constitutions of the free state of saxony and the state of brandenburg passed in 1992 , the sorbs ’ right to the protection , preservation and promotion of their national identity and their language is guaranteed .
on the initiative of saxony ’ s former prime minister kurt biedenkopf , a 'foundation for the sorbian nation ´ was set up in october 1991 .
" the sorbs were the original inhabitants of this territory .
the protection of this minority is very important , " biedenkopf said . " first of all , because we believe in minority rights .
secondly , because they have played a very influential and important role in the development of this area in germany .
and thirdly , because we cherish the culture and traditions of this small minority as an important aspect of saxon culture , " biedenkopf added .
but despite efforts to keep such things as costume and language alive , leos shatava from the sorbian institute in bautzen says a good proportion of young sorbs find it hard to relate to their own traditions amidst all the german influences .
" today , in these times of big changes and market economy , many sorbs have no time .
they have trouble with such things as unemployment etc , " leos shatava said .
the language factor although a large part of the cultural identity is rooted in the language , sorbian teacher alfons frenzel from upper lusatia believes that pure language skills alone won ’ t work any miracles .
" we have to make sorbian lessons more attractive .
we have to develop new school programmes and motivate the pupils to view sorbian as an important subject .
because we are like a bridge between german culture and slav culture and traditions , " alfons frenzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spring procession in a bid to keep the assimilation process alive , the sorbian language is also featured on special radio and television stations .
" the temptation to assimilate has greatly increased with electronic media , with television and the so-called virtual world .
it ’ s therefore more difficult than it used to be to maintain a minority identity , " biedenkopf said .
cultural riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical sorb easter eggs , intricately hand-painted all the more so against the background of efforts to create a common home in europe , where , as leos shatava from the sorbic institute believes , the emphasis is very much on shared values rather than on differences .
" on the one hand you can speak about unification , centralisation and globalisation , but on the other hand , today ’ s world is still thinking about cultural differences .
and people say we are richer if we have more languages , more cultures , more diversity in one world , " leos shatava said shatava knows that the future of the sorbs ’ identity will stand or fall with today ’ s young generation , and it is for that reason that the region 's elders will keep goading them into action . peter zimmermann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ?

" there is a good chance " that the record reached in 1996 under conservative leader helmut kohl will not be beaten , the spokesman said , adding that official figures were not yet available but would be released on friday .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest but worst-performing economy , formally adopted late last year a supplementary budget containing an anticipated record deficit of more than € 43.5 billion .
the german press reported on sunday that higher than forecast tax income in december , due in part to a fiscal amnesty on monies being held abroad , was behind the budget optimism . dw-world.de 2005 budget splits government , opposition the german parliament has begun a week of deliberations about the center-left government ’ s 2005 budget , with the opposition conservatives saying they will challenge the budget in germany ’ s constitutional court .

the government should stop contracting out cleaning services and bring them all under direct nhs control , it says .
the national audit office estimates so-called superbugs like mrsa kill as many as 5,000 people each year .
unison says the sharp rise in infections caught in hospitals can be directly attributed to the number of cleaners halving in the last 20 years .
the union , the uk 's biggest , says contracting out cleaning jobs has led to poor training , low retention levels and dirty hospitals - and it wants private contracts scrapped .
dave prentis , unison general secretary , told bbc news : " two things have happened over the past 15 years .
" cleaners have been contracted out to private companies , the criteria has been to reduce the cost of cleaning , rather than improve the quality , so now they 're no longer part of the ward team .
" we 've also had a massive reduction in the number of cleaners ...
15 years ago we had over 90,000 cleaners , we now have something like 55,000 . "
the government recently issued new guidelines to improve cleanliness and allow poor contractors to be punished .
spot checks but the chief nursing officer for england , chris beasley , said it was too simplistic to say nhs cleaners were good and private cleaners bad .
" there 's no doubt about it , in the 1980s and 1990s , the process both for contracted-out cleaners and indeed for in-house cleaners , there was a real push on just the cost and not the quality .
" now , there 's really good examples of cleaning from contracted-out firms as well as in-house ... there are good in both cases . "
she said the government had improved cleaners ' pay levels and she expected the numbers of cleaners in the nhs to rise in the coming years .
recent spot checks showed 90 out of 1,184 hospitals had poor or unacceptable cleanliness .
following the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering , there had been concerns from some quarters that hospitals were taking up the cheapest cleaning contracts instead of basing their decision on which company would do the best job .
health secretary john reid told the bbc : " i have made it plain to chief executives that cleanliness can not be regarded as an optional extra - it has to be be put right back at the centre of what hospitals are about . "
mr reid said he had made sure that frontline nursing staff had been given control of ward hygiene .
" that was one of the great mistakes that happened when we got contracting out - we broke that link between the ward sister and the nurses , and the actual cleaning on the wards . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said mrsa infections had doubled under labour - but mr reid seemed to place most of the blame on the policies of the previous tory administration .
" labour have said time and again they will introduce measures to improve ward cleanliness yet hospital hygiene has become a issue of great public concern .
" the government must be brought to account for their incompetence . "

the national audit office estimates so-called superbugs like mrsa kill as many as 5,000 people each year .
unison says the sharp rise in infections caught in hospitals can be directly attributed to the number of cleaners halving in the last 20 years .
the union , the uk 's biggest , says contracting out cleaning jobs has led to poor training , low retention levels and dirty hospitals - and it wants private contracts scrapped .
dave prentis , unison general secretary , told bbc news : " two things have happened over the past 15 years .
" cleaners have been contracted out to private companies , the criteria has been to reduce the cost of cleaning , rather than improve the quality , so now they 're no longer part of the ward team .
" we 've also had a massive reduction in the number of cleaners ...
15 years ago we had over 90,000 cleaners , we now have something like 55,000 . "
the government recently issued new guidelines to improve cleanliness and allow poor contractors to be punished .
spot checks but the chief nursing officer for england , chris beasley , said it was too simplistic to say nhs cleaners were good and private cleaners bad .
" there 's no doubt about it , in the 1980s and 1990s , the process both for contracted-out cleaners and indeed for in-house cleaners , there was a real push on just the cost and not the quality .
" now , there 's really good examples of cleaning from contracted-out firms as well as in-house ... there are good in both cases . "
she said the government had improved cleaners ' pay levels and she expected the numbers of cleaners in the nhs to rise in the coming years .
recent spot checks showed 90 out of 1,184 hospitals had poor or unacceptable cleanliness .
following the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering , there had been concerns from some quarters that hospitals were taking up the cheapest cleaning contracts instead of basing their decision on which company would do the best job .
health secretary john reid told the bbc : " i have made it plain to chief executives that cleanliness can not be regarded as an optional extra - it has to be be put right back at the centre of what hospitals are about . "
mr reid said he had made sure that frontline nursing staff had been given control of ward hygiene .
" that was one of the great mistakes that happened when we got contracting out - we broke that link between the ward sister and the nurses , and the actual cleaning on the wards . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said mrsa infections had doubled under labour - but mr reid seemed to place most of the blame on the policies of the previous tory administration .
" labour have said time and again they will introduce measures to improve ward cleanliness yet hospital hygiene has become a issue of great public concern .
" the government must be brought to account for their incompetence . "

last year saw the emergence of portable media players , such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player , the samsung yepp , the iriver pmc-100 , and the archos av400 series among others .
but this year , they are set to get smarter and more connected , to allow people to find more video to watch on them .
archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday .
dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430 , it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time .
" consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access , " said henri crohas , chief of archos .
" and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time . "
archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people 's pockets , after the mobile .
entertaining pockets unlike windows-based players , the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source , such as tvs , as well as playback .
the content put onto the devices is copy protected so can not then be swapped to another device .
recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it .
and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link .
archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device .
microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces , primarily for us consumers though .
it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo , which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces .
the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones .
it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central , vh1 and country music tv on its devices .
and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news , entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices .
but the ability to record directly from tv , vcr , and digital cable and satellite boxes , which windows-based devices do not offer , certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too .
feeling ' bullish ' the increased capability of these devices , and the content deals that are being done , may go some way to persuading people to use them .
recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music .
only 13 % of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move .
more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices .
" this year , we are ready for an explosion of portable media , " james bernard , lead product manager for portable media centers at microsoft told the bbc news website .
" we are very bullish about it .
the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer , " he added .
the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too .
there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work .
although microsoft 's content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment , talks were " always on-going " with european content suppliers to offer similar services .
various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however .
but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices , particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled .
the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work .
ces , which runs from 6 to 9 january , showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005 .

last year saw the emergence of portable media players , such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player , the samsung yepp , the iriver pmc-100 , and the archos av400 series among others .
but this year , they are set to get smarter and more connected , to allow people to find more video to watch on them .
archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday .
dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430 , it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time .
" consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access , " said henri crohas , chief of archos .
" and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time . "
archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people 's pockets , after the mobile .
entertaining pockets unlike windows-based players , the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source , such as tvs , as well as playback .
the content put onto the devices is copy protected so can not then be swapped to another device .
video players can store movies , programmes , music and photos recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it .
and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link .
archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device .
microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces , primarily for us consumers though .
it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo , which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces .
the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones .
it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central , vh1 and country music tv on its devices .
and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news , entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices .
but the ability to record directly from tv , vcr , and digital cable and satellite boxes , which windows-based devices do not offer , certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too .
feeling ' bullish ' the increased capability of these devices , and the content deals that are being done , may go some way to persuading people to use them .
recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music .
only 13 % of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move .
more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices .
video playback on camera and pdas is also on the horizon " this year , we are ready for an explosion of portable media , " james bernard , lead product manager for portable media centers at microsoft told the bbc news website .
" we are very bullish about it .
the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer , " he added .
the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too .
there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work .

deputy leader nicola sturgeon has challenged him to make a statement to holyrood amid controversy over the pair 's family holiday together .
she is urging him to give full details of " all hospitality provided " by the journalist .
mr mcconnell has insisted he has broken no rules and has nothing to explain .
the controversy over the hogmanay holiday in majorca has also led to questions being raised over ms wark 's role as a political broadcaster .
tory msp brian monteith has called for her to step down or be sacked , but the bbc has said no decision has yet been taken on who will front its general election coverage .
' open to question ' in a letter to mr mcconnell , ms sturgeon said : " while your holiday arrangements are , in the normal course of events , a private matter , i am sure you appreciate your responsibility as first minister to show leadership and to be open and transparent with the scottish people .
" it is in light of such responsibility that your judgement in deciding to be absent from scotland - the hogmanay capital of the world - during the new year celebrations and to accept the hospitality of a senior bbc political broadcaster and journalist , has been open to question . "
she said the disclosure that he had previously been a guest of ms wark without declaring it in the register of msps ' interests raised " an issue of more direct concern . "
the tories have called on ms wark to step down " given that it was you who , rightly , urged msps to raise their game a few months ago , i am sure you will not want protracted discussion of your own conduct as first minister to distract parliament from the important work that lies ahead of us in 2005 , " she said .
" therefore , i would urge you to take steps to clear this matter up as quickly as possible . "
however , in an interview in the observer newspaper , mr mcconnell again defended his friendship with ms wark and his family 's stay at her villa in spain .
he said : " i do n't think it 's good for politicians to defend journalists , but i have to say kirsty wark is one of scotland 's most outstanding broadcasters of my lifetime and has been known by people of all political parties and none as somebody who 's been objective , impartial and full of integrity .
" in the almost 20 years that i 've known her , i 've never asked who she votes for and she 's never told me . "
when asked if he would holiday with the ms wark and her husband alan clements again , he said : " let me be very clear about this ...
i have absolutely no regrets about this whatsoever .
" they are very good , very close family friends who are not influenced at all in their work by their friendship with me , and i 'm not influenced in my work by my friendship with them apart from the fact that i 'm a happier person because i know nice people . "
