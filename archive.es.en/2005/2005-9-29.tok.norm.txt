the fact was reason enough for minelli to start up an office in hanover through which he hopes to influence germany 's assisted-suicide debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every end is dignified " it 's about having a group here , that involves itself in the assisted-suicide debate , " said minelli upon announcing the opening of the office last week .
" we want to give it a push . " at the moment , german law does n't punish doctors who help their patients die .
but courts have investigated neglectful care that has led to the deaths of critically-ill patients .
in switzerland , organizations like dignitas , which means " dignity " in latin , can not only counsel people who want to end their lives , but are able to give them the deadly medicinal cocktail - provided by a doctor - to carry out their wish .

more than 3,100 swiss francs -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- . fierce oppositio n germany has n't exactly rolled out the welcome mat .
on wednesday , the mass daily bild ran a photo of the organization 's new hanover offices under the headline " here is where they sell death " . the justice minister of lower saxony , elisabeth hiester-neumann , responded to the news this week by announcing that she is looking into ways of outlawing assisted-suicide , a practice which is generally tolerated by law , although not openly discussed .
" the organized promotion of suicide can not be tolerated , " hiester-neumann said . the ministry also said they planned to have the building observed by police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop margot kässmann with nuns the bishop of hanover , margot kässmann , shared the justice ministry 's concerns , calling dignitas ' move " problematic " , and adding that there should be no such thing as a " quick and effective death , " and that death should be further integrated into society . germany 's protestant and catholic churches are , alongside conservative politicians , the two fiercest opponents of a system that allows people to choose death over life , said susanne dehmel , of the german society for dying in dignity -lrb- dghs -rrb- . " they say god created life and only he can take it , but the wider population does n't go along with that , " she said .
" they are more of the opinion that they should treat life as a gift , which also means they should be able to put an end to it if they want to . " worst case sce n ario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-round care and pain relief can remove the will to die thomas schindler , managing director of the german association of palliative medicine offers a middle way . " our experience tells us that good care makes the process of dying much more bearable , " he said .
" premature death is irreversible , so we do n't support that , but neither do we extend suffering , and palliative medicine often provides adequate alleviation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should it be a christian decision ?
but , as dignitas records show , that 's just not enough for some people .
the dghs says germany should embrace all the options and introduce an all-encompassing law which would clearly provide for all eventualities , and make assisted-suicide a possible last resort for those who have tried or rejected the wide range of other options . " people should not have to jump under a train or leap from the seventh floor in order to take their lives , " she said .
" although palliative medicine can be a huge help for many people , and often removes the will to die , there are still those patients for whom it does n't work , and these people have to be given the chance to die legally .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .
he also stated that there were now greater similarities in life styles and ideals of citizens from all over germany . bernd grässler -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election campaign heads east german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative rival angela merkel have started their campaigns in the eastern parts of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .
but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .

" turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .

" it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location .

meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what d 'you mean you were just playing with the coaster ? "
and what of the fidgety folk who , upon sitting down , automatically pick up the coasters rather than settling their glasses on them ?
as they fumble with that most traditional and predictable of pub accessories , will they suddenly find they 've been landed with a posse of drinks ordered inadvertently ? that , surely , will be the landlord 's call . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "

could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what d 'you mean you were just playing with the coaster ? "
and what of the fidgety folk who , upon sitting down , automatically pick up the coasters rather than settling their glasses on them ?
as they fumble with that most traditional and predictable of pub accessories , will they suddenly find they 've been landed with a posse of drinks ordered inadvertently ? that , surely , will be the landlord 's call . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 29.09.2005 when life becomes worse than death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted-suicide requires a caring and helping hand in a move which has caused considerable consternation among politicians and the church , the swiss organization for assisted suicide , dignitas , has founded a subsidiary in germany . the numbers , though not particularly high , are noteworthy . since ludwig a minelli founded dignitas in 1998 , the swiss assisted-suicide organization has helped 453 people to their deaths . more than half of those , according to the organization , come from germany .
the fact was reason enough for minelli to start up an office in hanover through which he hopes to influence germany 's assisted-suicide debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every end is dignified " it 's about having a group here , that involves itself in the assisted-suicide debate , " said minelli upon announcing the opening of the office last week .
" we want to give it a push . " at the moment , german law does n't punish doctors who help their patients die .
but courts have investigated neglectful care that has led to the deaths of critically-ill patients .
in switzerland , organizations like dignitas , which means " dignity " in latin , can not only counsel people who want to end their lives , but are able to give them the deadly medicinal cocktail - provided by a doctor - to carry out their wish .
the cost ?
more than 3,100 swiss francs -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- . fierce oppositio n germany has n't exactly rolled out the welcome mat .
on wednesday , the mass daily bild ran a photo of the organization 's new hanover offices under the headline " here is where they sell death " . the justice minister of lower saxony , elisabeth hiester-neumann , responded to the news this week by announcing that she is looking into ways of outlawing assisted-suicide , a practice which is generally tolerated by law , although not openly discussed .
" the organized promotion of suicide can not be tolerated , " hiester-neumann said . the ministry also said they planned to have the building observed by police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop margot kässmann with nuns the bishop of hanover , margot kässmann , shared the justice ministry 's concerns , calling dignitas ' move " problematic " , and adding that there should be no such thing as a " quick and effective death , " and that death should be further integrated into society . germany 's protestant and catholic churches are , alongside conservative politicians , the two fiercest opponents of a system that allows people to choose death over life , said susanne dehmel , of the german society for dying in dignity -lrb- dghs -rrb- . " they say god created life and only he can take it , but the wider population does n't go along with that , " she said .
" they are more of the opinion that they should treat life as a gift , which also means they should be able to put an end to it if they want to . " worst case sce n ario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-round care and pain relief can remove the will to die thomas schindler , managing director of the german association of palliative medicine offers a middle way . " our experience tells us that good care makes the process of dying much more bearable , " he said .
" premature death is irreversible , so we do n't support that , but neither do we extend suffering , and palliative medicine often provides adequate alleviation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should it be a christian decision ?
but , as dignitas records show , that 's just not enough for some people .
the dghs says germany should embrace all the options and introduce an all-encompassing law which would clearly provide for all eventualities , and make assisted-suicide a possible last resort for those who have tried or rejected the wide range of other options . " people should not have to jump under a train or leap from the seventh floor in order to take their lives , " she said .
" although palliative medicine can be a huge help for many people , and often removes the will to die , there are still those patients for whom it does n't work , and these people have to be given the chance to die legally .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .

" it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .
last december eu leaders gave ankara an initial green light to start talks on oct .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what d 'you mean you were just playing with the coaster ? "
and what of the fidgety folk who , upon sitting down , automatically pick up the coasters rather than settling their glasses on them ?
as they fumble with that most traditional and predictable of pub accessories , will they suddenly find they 've been landed with a posse of drinks ordered inadvertently ? that , surely , will be the landlord 's call . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .

but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .

the fact was reason enough for minelli to start up an office in hanover through which he hopes to influence germany 's assisted-suicide debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every end is dignified " it 's about having a group here , that involves itself in the assisted-suicide debate , " said minelli upon announcing the opening of the office last week .
" we want to give it a push . " at the moment , german law does n't punish doctors who help their patients die .
but courts have investigated neglectful care that has led to the deaths of critically-ill patients .
in switzerland , organizations like dignitas , which means " dignity " in latin , can not only counsel people who want to end their lives , but are able to give them the deadly medicinal cocktail - provided by a doctor - to carry out their wish .

on wednesday , the mass daily bild ran a photo of the organization 's new hanover offices under the headline " here is where they sell death " . the justice minister of lower saxony , elisabeth hiester-neumann , responded to the news this week by announcing that she is looking into ways of outlawing assisted-suicide , a practice which is generally tolerated by law , although not openly discussed .
" the organized promotion of suicide can not be tolerated , " hiester-neumann said . the ministry also said they planned to have the building observed by police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop margot kässmann with nuns the bishop of hanover , margot kässmann , shared the justice ministry 's concerns , calling dignitas ' move " problematic " , and adding that there should be no such thing as a " quick and effective death , " and that death should be further integrated into society . germany 's protestant and catholic churches are , alongside conservative politicians , the two fiercest opponents of a system that allows people to choose death over life , said susanne dehmel , of the german society for dying in dignity -lrb- dghs -rrb- . " they say god created life and only he can take it , but the wider population does n't go along with that , " she said .
" they are more of the opinion that they should treat life as a gift , which also means they should be able to put an end to it if they want to .

but , as dignitas records show , that 's just not enough for some people .
the dghs says germany should embrace all the options and introduce an all-encompassing law which would clearly provide for all eventualities , and make assisted-suicide a possible last resort for those who have tried or rejected the wide range of other options . " people should not have to jump under a train or leap from the seventh floor in order to take their lives , " she said .

the fact was reason enough for minelli to start up an office in hanover through which he hopes to influence germany 's assisted-suicide debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every end is dignified " it 's about having a group here , that involves itself in the assisted-suicide debate , " said minelli upon announcing the opening of the office last week .
" we want to give it a push . " at the moment , german law does n't punish doctors who help their patients die .
but courts have investigated neglectful care that has led to the deaths of critically-ill patients .
in switzerland , organizations like dignitas , which means " dignity " in latin , can not only counsel people who want to end their lives , but are able to give them the deadly medicinal cocktail - provided by a doctor - to carry out their wish .
the cost ?
more than 3,100 swiss francs -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- . fierce oppositio n germany has n't exactly rolled out the welcome mat .
on wednesday , the mass daily bild ran a photo of the organization 's new hanover offices under the headline " here is where they sell death " . the justice minister of lower saxony , elisabeth hiester-neumann , responded to the news this week by announcing that she is looking into ways of outlawing assisted-suicide , a practice which is generally tolerated by law , although not openly discussed .
" the organized promotion of suicide can not be tolerated , " hiester-neumann said . the ministry also said they planned to have the building observed by police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop margot kässmann with nuns the bishop of hanover , margot kässmann , shared the justice ministry 's concerns , calling dignitas ' move " problematic " , and adding that there should be no such thing as a " quick and effective death , " and that death should be further integrated into society . germany 's protestant and catholic churches are , alongside conservative politicians , the two fiercest opponents of a system that allows people to choose death over life , said susanne dehmel , of the german society for dying in dignity -lrb- dghs -rrb- . " they say god created life and only he can take it , but the wider population does n't go along with that , " she said .
" they are more of the opinion that they should treat life as a gift , which also means they should be able to put an end to it if they want to . " worst case sce n ario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-round care and pain relief can remove the will to die thomas schindler , managing director of the german association of palliative medicine offers a middle way . " our experience tells us that good care makes the process of dying much more bearable , " he said .
" premature death is irreversible , so we do n't support that , but neither do we extend suffering , and palliative medicine often provides adequate alleviation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should it be a christian decision ?
but , as dignitas records show , that 's just not enough for some people .
the dghs says germany should embrace all the options and introduce an all-encompassing law which would clearly provide for all eventualities , and make assisted-suicide a possible last resort for those who have tried or rejected the wide range of other options . " people should not have to jump under a train or leap from the seventh floor in order to take their lives , " she said .
" although palliative medicine can be a huge help for many people , and often removes the will to die , there are still those patients for whom it does n't work , and these people have to be given the chance to die legally .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box . " it 's architecture that could raise questions of how art should be consumed and push the boundary of what a museum should be , " he added . indeed , many new yorkers feel that the fifth avenue guggenheim , designed by frank lloyd wright , is in fact the most precious piece of art the museum has to offer . likewise , it 's no secret that when krens speaks about architecture , he is in fact referring to the roaring success of the bilbao guggenheim in spain . hailed as one of the most important pieces of architecture of the late 20th century , the bilbao museum is an immense structure composed of tilting metal-clad forms designed by canadian architect frank gehry . a magnificent success both culturally and fiscally , the museum attracts just shy of one million visitors per year and has also brought international attention to a formerly quiet and disregarded spanish industrial town .

people can visit the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- exhibitiont 24 hours a day until the exhibition closes on september 19 , 2004 .
no one denies that krens and company have put guggenheim on the map , but not everyone is behind the idea of " branding " a museum 's reputation . critics of krens say he has overstretched the institution 's artistic and financial resources and has arguably led to the commercialization of a once deeply respected modern art collection . it was in fact this very conflict that led billionaire philanthropist peter b. lewis to resign as chairman of the guggenheim last january stating he was convinced his one-time friend krens was pushing the guggenheim towards financial ruin by planning new museums around the world . a trustee since 1993 , lewis had become the museum 's top benefactor , contributing $ 77 million -lrb- 64 million euros -rrb- over the years . even moma director glenn lowry , a former student of krens , has tried to distance himself from the latter 's flamboyance . " we are a museum " he said , referring to the new moma building that opened last year , " not a destination . " the guggenheim currently maintains five museums across the world in new york , las vegas , venice , berlin and bilbao . when asked why someone might want to construct a modern art museum in a place like las vegas krens said that " when you 're in the missionary business , you have to go to where the heathens are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained the crunch issues grand coalition a delicate balancing act germany -pipe- 29.09.2005 opinion : germany 's new opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's small parties have been relegated to the opposition no politician ever wants a seat in the loyal opposition , but germany 's three small parties could use their position to make strategic decisions the bigger parties would n't tolerate , says deutsche welle 's heinz dylong . it 's foreseeable that germany 's next government will be a grand coalition of the left-center social democratic party and the right-center christian union parties , leaving the free democrats , greens and the left party to chew over what roles they 'll play from the opposition 's hard benches . each party will have to decide what risks it wants to take and how to show its strengths against a ruling government that will have a comfortable majority of about 450 of the some 600 seats in the bundestag . fdp ca n focus o n ce n tral themes with 61 seats , the free-market liberal fdp will be the largest of the small parties in parliament .
in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box . " it 's architecture that could raise questions of how art should be consumed and push the boundary of what a museum should be , " he added . indeed , many new yorkers feel that the fifth avenue guggenheim , designed by frank lloyd wright , is in fact the most precious piece of art the museum has to offer . likewise , it 's no secret that when krens speaks about architecture , he is in fact referring to the roaring success of the bilbao guggenheim in spain . hailed as one of the most important pieces of architecture of the late 20th century , the bilbao museum is an immense structure composed of tilting metal-clad forms designed by canadian architect frank gehry . a magnificent success both culturally and fiscally , the museum attracts just shy of one million visitors per year and has also brought international attention to a formerly quiet and disregarded spanish industrial town .

people can visit the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- exhibitiont 24 hours a day until the exhibition closes on september 19 , 2004 .
no one denies that krens and company have put guggenheim on the map , but not everyone is behind the idea of " branding " a museum 's reputation . critics of krens say he has overstretched the institution 's artistic and financial resources and has arguably led to the commercialization of a once deeply respected modern art collection . it was in fact this very conflict that led billionaire philanthropist peter b. lewis to resign as chairman of the guggenheim last january stating he was convinced his one-time friend krens was pushing the guggenheim towards financial ruin by planning new museums around the world . a trustee since 1993 , lewis had become the museum 's top benefactor , contributing $ 77 million -lrb- 64 million euros -rrb- over the years . even moma director glenn lowry , a former student of krens , has tried to distance himself from the latter 's flamboyance . " we are a museum " he said , referring to the new moma building that opened last year , " not a destination . " the guggenheim currently maintains five museums across the world in new york , las vegas , venice , berlin and bilbao . when asked why someone might want to construct a modern art museum in a place like las vegas krens said that " when you 're in the missionary business , you have to go to where the heathens are .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2005 eu turkey talks threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun already setting on turkey 's eu membership dreams ?
eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .
last december eu leaders gave ankara an initial green light to start talks on oct .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .

" turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2005 smart coasters know to fill ' er up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these simple coasters just do n't know how to communicate !
beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained the crunch issues grand coalition a delicate balancing act germany -pipe- 29.09.2005 opinion : germany 's new opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's small parties have been relegated to the opposition no politician ever wants a seat in the loyal opposition , but germany 's three small parties could use their position to make strategic decisions the bigger parties would n't tolerate , says deutsche welle 's heinz dylong . it 's foreseeable that germany 's next government will be a grand coalition of the left-center social democratic party and the right-center christian union parties , leaving the free democrats , greens and the left party to chew over what roles they 'll play from the opposition 's hard benches . each party will have to decide what risks it wants to take and how to show its strengths against a ruling government that will have a comfortable majority of about 450 of the some 600 seats in the bundestag . fdp ca n focus o n ce n tral themes with 61 seats , the free-market liberal fdp will be the largest of the small parties in parliament .
in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .

" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .

meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained the crunch issues grand coalition a delicate balancing act germany -pipe- 29.09.2005 opinion : germany 's new opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's small parties have been relegated to the opposition no politician ever wants a seat in the loyal opposition , but germany 's three small parties could use their position to make strategic decisions the bigger parties would n't tolerate , says deutsche welle 's heinz dylong . it 's foreseeable that germany 's next government will be a grand coalition of the left-center social democratic party and the right-center christian union parties , leaving the free democrats , greens and the left party to chew over what roles they 'll play from the opposition 's hard benches . each party will have to decide what risks it wants to take and how to show its strengths against a ruling government that will have a comfortable majority of about 450 of the some 600 seats in the bundestag . fdp ca n focus o n ce n tral themes with 61 seats , the free-market liberal fdp will be the largest of the small parties in parliament .
in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box . " it 's architecture that could raise questions of how art should be consumed and push the boundary of what a museum should be , " he added . indeed , many new yorkers feel that the fifth avenue guggenheim , designed by frank lloyd wright , is in fact the most precious piece of art the museum has to offer . likewise , it 's no secret that when krens speaks about architecture , he is in fact referring to the roaring success of the bilbao guggenheim in spain . hailed as one of the most important pieces of architecture of the late 20th century , the bilbao museum is an immense structure composed of tilting metal-clad forms designed by canadian architect frank gehry . a magnificent success both culturally and fiscally , the museum attracts just shy of one million visitors per year and has also brought international attention to a formerly quiet and disregarded spanish industrial town .

no one denies that krens and company have put guggenheim on the map , but not everyone is behind the idea of " branding " a museum 's reputation . critics of krens say he has overstretched the institution 's artistic and financial resources and has arguably led to the commercialization of a once deeply respected modern art collection . it was in fact this very conflict that led billionaire philanthropist peter b. lewis to resign as chairman of the guggenheim last january stating he was convinced his one-time friend krens was pushing the guggenheim towards financial ruin by planning new museums around the world . a trustee since 1993 , lewis had become the museum 's top benefactor , contributing $ 77 million -lrb- 64 million euros -rrb- over the years . even moma director glenn lowry , a former student of krens , has tried to distance himself from the latter 's flamboyance . " we are a museum " he said , referring to the new moma building that opened last year , " not a destination . " the guggenheim currently maintains five museums across the world in new york , las vegas , venice , berlin and bilbao . when asked why someone might want to construct a modern art museum in a place like las vegas krens said that " when you 're in the missionary business , you have to go to where the heathens are .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .

" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu .

" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .

meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .

politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .

economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .
last december eu leaders gave ankara an initial green light to start talks on oct .
3 . turkey meanwhile said it will only decide whether to come to luxembourg for the start of talks once it has seen what the eu puts on the table .

this number is 20 times greater than what the interior ministry had announced this summer for use in united nations or european union missions .
schmidt justified the call by saying that although the german army bundeswehr had been better equipped and trained recently , the soldiers were " only partially qualified " to put a halt to riots and unrest such as those in kosovo in 2004 .
the army 's military police is best equipped to carry out duties within the bundeswehr .
schmidt furthermore made reference to an agreement between the 25 eu ministers responsible for such missions that such a force , which could be sent to areas of unrest within a month and would number some 900 , would be created .
defense minister peter struck rejected germany 's participation at that time , saying that the responsibilities of army and police were clearly divided . dw-world.de struck visits balkans to bolster troops german defense minister peter struck is on a two-day visit to meet german troops stationed in the balkans .
germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace .

the company was nevertheless sticking to its full-year earnings targets , a hannover re spokesman said .
hannover re had already lowered its profit forecasts for 2005 following hurricane katrina , which devastated large areas of the southern united states in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2005 eu turkey talks threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun already setting on turkey 's eu membership dreams ?
eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2005 eu turkey talks threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun already setting on turkey 's eu membership dreams ?
eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .
last december eu leaders gave ankara an initial green light to start talks on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

this question , which tortures some bavarians , wo n't be settled by a bavarian district court .
the court was faced with a case brought by one of the descendants of ludwig 's stable master .
the great grandson of the stable master had discovered while reading from a local history book an allusion to a possible hanky-panky between his great grandfather and the king , who died in 1886 .
the controversial lines refer to king ludwig ii having called the count by the pet name " lolus , " a reference to the mistress of his grandfather ludwig i , lola montez .
the plaintiff claimed that these lines had damaged the reputation of his great grandfather and demanded a retribution payment of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 301,265 -rrb- .
rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of ludwig 's sexual orientation , the court assisted the two parties to come to a settlement .
part of the agreement stipulates that a note be added to the book which makes clear that the great grandson of the stable master does not agree with the portrayal in the book . dw-world.de court to decide if mad king was gay the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .

in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

however , in seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank , the german jobless total actually increased by 39,000 to 4.835 million in september , the highest level since june .
the adjusted jobless total edged up to 11.7 percent from 11.6 percent , the german central bank said .
a regional breakdown of the numbers showed that unemployment in the economically more important western germany rose this month .
by contrast , the jobless total was down in the former communist east . dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

this number is 20 times greater than what the interior ministry had announced this summer for use in united nations or european union missions .
schmidt justified the call by saying that although the german army bundeswehr had been better equipped and trained recently , the soldiers were " only partially qualified " to put a halt to riots and unrest such as those in kosovo in 2004 .
the army 's military police is best equipped to carry out duties within the bundeswehr .
schmidt furthermore made reference to an agreement between the 25 eu ministers responsible for such missions that such a force , which could be sent to areas of unrest within a month and would number some 900 , would be created .
defense minister peter struck rejected germany 's participation at that time , saying that the responsibilities of army and police were clearly divided . dw-world.de struck visits balkans to bolster troops german defense minister peter struck is on a two-day visit to meet german troops stationed in the balkans .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc cdu wants to send german cops abroad the defense policy speaker of christian democratic union / christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , christian schmidt , has recommended that germany create a force of up to 2,000 police officers who would be permanently ready to be sent to crisis regions .
this number is 20 times greater than what the interior ministry had announced this summer for use in united nations or european union missions .
schmidt justified the call by saying that although the german army bundeswehr had been better equipped and trained recently , the soldiers were " only partially qualified " to put a halt to riots and unrest such as those in kosovo in 2004 .
the army 's military police is best equipped to carry out duties within the bundeswehr .
schmidt furthermore made reference to an agreement between the 25 eu ministers responsible for such missions that such a force , which could be sent to areas of unrest within a month and would number some 900 , would be created .
defense minister peter struck rejected germany 's participation at that time , saying that the responsibilities of army and police were clearly divided . dw-world.de struck visits balkans to bolster troops german defense minister peter struck is on a two-day visit to meet german troops stationed in the balkans .
germany increased troop numbers there recently as part of a european union effort to maintain a fragile peace .

in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 29.09.2005 government denies resignation rumors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation abounds on whether it 's schröder 's time to say goodbye while germans wait for the announcement of a new government , speculation is rising about chancellor gerhard schröder 's resignation .
meanwhile , the opposition believes more and more in a grand coalition . the surprising optimism following wednesday 's talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- led by angela merkel has now been followed by further speculation about how the country will find a way out of its political paralysis .
the rumor mill in berlin is churning out speculation that schröder would rescind his claims of being chancellor for a third term .
the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .
the answer from the chancellor 's office was , as usual , also very clear : " absolute nonsense and absolute rubbish . "
free democrats odd man out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu head angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- .
could the red jacket be a sign of her willingness to work together with the social democrats ?
the grand coalition as the final solution to the inconclusive elections on september 18 became more and more likely after angela merkel and the christian democrats exited talks with their preferred partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on thursday .
" the possibility or likelihood of a coalition with the spd is much higher than the other constellations , " merkel told reporters .
in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .
but he now appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that the fdp will remain in the opposition .
" it seems in all probability that we 're heading for a grand coalition , " he told reporters , adding that schröder should now step aside for the good of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- middle -rrb- thought that his party , the fdp , would share power but has had to resign itself that it likely will be in the opposition " it would be right and appropriate to recognize that it 's not about him or his personal career , but that it is about the fate of our country .
he should not stand in the way of a new beginning any longer , " westerwelle said .
economy minister wolfgang clement however rejected accusations that schröder wanted to remain chancellor for selfish reasons .
he told reporters it is " completely incorrect to say it has to do with the personal ambitions of the chancellor . "
rather , it had to do with how power would be shared in germany and the demands of the social democrats .
the two sides have scheduled the next round of talks for october 5 - three days after a district in the eastern city of dresden goes to the polls in a by-election and two days after germany 's national holiday , which is being celebrated for the 15th time .
and if the rumor mill in berlin is correct , also two days after gerhard schröder 's resignation . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2005 eu turkey talks threatened großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun already setting on turkey 's eu membership dreams ?
eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .

" turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box . " it 's architecture that could raise questions of how art should be consumed and push the boundary of what a museum should be , " he added . indeed , many new yorkers feel that the fifth avenue guggenheim , designed by frank lloyd wright , is in fact the most precious piece of art the museum has to offer . likewise , it 's no secret that when krens speaks about architecture , he is in fact referring to the roaring success of the bilbao guggenheim in spain . hailed as one of the most important pieces of architecture of the late 20th century , the bilbao museum is an immense structure composed of tilting metal-clad forms designed by canadian architect frank gehry . a magnificent success both culturally and fiscally , the museum attracts just shy of one million visitors per year and has also brought international attention to a formerly quiet and disregarded spanish industrial town .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box . " it 's architecture that could raise questions of how art should be consumed and push the boundary of what a museum should be , " he added . indeed , many new yorkers feel that the fifth avenue guggenheim , designed by frank lloyd wright , is in fact the most precious piece of art the museum has to offer . likewise , it 's no secret that when krens speaks about architecture , he is in fact referring to the roaring success of the bilbao guggenheim in spain . hailed as one of the most important pieces of architecture of the late 20th century , the bilbao museum is an immense structure composed of tilting metal-clad forms designed by canadian architect frank gehry . a magnificent success both culturally and fiscally , the museum attracts just shy of one million visitors per year and has also brought international attention to a formerly quiet and disregarded spanish industrial town .

people can visit the museum of modern art -lrb- moma -rrb- exhibitiont 24 hours a day until the exhibition closes on september 19 , 2004 .
no one denies that krens and company have put guggenheim on the map , but not everyone is behind the idea of " branding " a museum 's reputation . critics of krens say he has overstretched the institution 's artistic and financial resources and has arguably led to the commercialization of a once deeply respected modern art collection . it was in fact this very conflict that led billionaire philanthropist peter b. lewis to resign as chairman of the guggenheim last january stating he was convinced his one-time friend krens was pushing the guggenheim towards financial ruin by planning new museums around the world . a trustee since 1993 , lewis had become the museum 's top benefactor , contributing $ 77 million -lrb- 64 million euros -rrb- over the years . even moma director glenn lowry , a former student of krens , has tried to distance himself from the latter 's flamboyance . " we are a museum " he said , referring to the new moma building that opened last year , " not a destination . " the guggenheim currently maintains five museums across the world in new york , las vegas , venice , berlin and bilbao . when asked why someone might want to construct a modern art museum in a place like las vegas krens said that " when you 're in the missionary business , you have to go to where the heathens are .

the fact was reason enough for minelli to start up an office in hanover through which he hopes to influence germany 's assisted-suicide debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every end is dignified " it 's about having a group here , that involves itself in the assisted-suicide debate , " said minelli upon announcing the opening of the office last week .
" we want to give it a push . " at the moment , german law does n't punish doctors who help their patients die .
but courts have investigated neglectful care that has led to the deaths of critically-ill patients .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what d 'you mean you were just playing with the coaster ? "
and what of the fidgety folk who , upon sitting down , automatically pick up the coasters rather than settling their glasses on them ?
as they fumble with that most traditional and predictable of pub accessories , will they suddenly find they 've been landed with a posse of drinks ordered inadvertently ? that , surely , will be the landlord 's call . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .

but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .

beer and cutting edge technology are enough to ignite passion in the humble hearts of many a german man , so how better to help them to happiness than through a new invention which marries amber nectar with innovation ? it 's a coaster , of the interactive rather than the classically warped or sodden variety , and its inventors are hoping it will become as popular in pubs and bars as the beer which stands upon it .
not only can it inform the bar staff when it is time for a refill , but it can also double up as a voting device for those agonized evenings of karaoke or quizzes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let the coaster talk to the bar staff and customers to each other created by computer scientists andreas butz of the university of munich and michael schmitz of saarland university , the new lazy drinker 's best friend looks like a regular beermat .
but beneath the cardboard surface lurks a small , flat baseplate which conceals pressure and acceleration sensors that react to the weight of the glass and the position and movement of the coasters . clever as they are , these microsensors pass on whatever information the drinker gives them via radio link to the bar , where the signal is picked up and decoded by a waiting computer . the inventors believe the gadget could be used as a voting device - for instance to judge the performance of a karaoke singer or to give an opinion on referee decisions on big-screen matches in sports bars .
a " yes " vote , for instance , could be registered by raising the glass , causing the sensors to move .
a " no " would be registered by raising the glass and then turning the cardboard mat over and replacing it on the baseplate , thus causing a telltale double movement of the sensors . flap for a fast order when the glass is empty , the drinker can use the cardboard beermat to order another beer .
the customer conveys the urgency of the request by " flapping " on the sensor with the mat , and by using a stack of mats can express the number of drinks ordered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what d 'you mean you were just playing with the coaster ? "
and what of the fidgety folk who , upon sitting down , automatically pick up the coasters rather than settling their glasses on them ?
as they fumble with that most traditional and predictable of pub accessories , will they suddenly find they 've been landed with a posse of drinks ordered inadvertently ? that , surely , will be the landlord 's call . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

stolpe said that growth requires a reform policy for the whole of germany , not only targeted support for the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " the dramatic labor market situation , in which we are losing more jobs than we are gaining , especially in the realm of construction , is dampening any progress we are making in terms of economic development , " he said . how to spe n d se n sibly stolpe was referring to the manufacturing industry which is growing twice as fast in the eastern states as those in the western part of the country .
he stressed that in future , the air and space travel , automobile and chemical industries , tourism and health should be given investment priority . by the same token , he outlined his opposition to penalizing states in the former east who do n't use the money they receive for rebuilding their infrastructure , but put it towards paying off their debts instead . a n other 15 years in his report in this , the 15th year since unification , stolpe focused on economic issues , but also listed well-known problems such as the migration of young people and infrastructure deficits .
he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .

oil on canvas -lrb- solomon r. guggenheim museum , new york -rrb- the purpose of the conference was to promote a traveling guggenheim collection , which will be on display in bonn for six months starting in july of 2006 . the exhibit , called " the great collections , " is a selection of some 250 objects , ranging from the masterworks of kandinsky to rothko to warhol to minimal and post-minimalists like carl andre and richard serra . repeating the moma success despite the intense logistical , physical and financial cost of sending some of the world 's most precious works of art around the world , there is fairly solid evidence to suggest that mobile exhibits or branch museums can be a significant tourism draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guggenheim museum , designed by frank gehry in bilbao spain in 2004 a record 1.2 million people flocked to see an exhibition of masterpieces from new york 's museum of modern art in berlin . the museum , the neue nationalgalerie stayed open around the clock for the final few days to accommodate as many people as possible . likewise , the bonn exhibit at over 6,000 square meters -lrb- 64,500 square feet -rrb- , is the largest show ever mounted at the museum there . krens does not anticipate anything less than the success that guggenheim currently experiences at their berlin location . " these projects are part of the on-going guggenheim dialog , what we are hoping to do with this exhibition in bonn is to communicate about our aspirations to an audience that is uniquely positioned to appreciate it , " he said . new museums for a new era krens recently stepped down from his post as museum director to assume the position of general director of the guggenheim foundation - a move which will free him up to devote more of his time to guggenheim 's somewhat controversial " expansionary " approach to museum building , the museum claims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas krens at the guggenheim in berlin .
giving his stump speech , krens said that " the traditional model of the art museum is obsolete - it 's an 18th century idea wrapped in a 19th century box .

he suggested that it would take another 15 years to complete the path to unification , and appealed for patience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the mood in the east and west are one and the same , " he said .
" people are unsatisfied , impatient and they no longer really believe in the ' aufbau ost ' reconstruction program .
i think what is required for the second half , if you like , is patience and single-mindedness , but people will also have to get used to being proud of things . " in his report , stolpe concluded that overall , since 1990 , the former east germany has evolved substantially , with the average income now twice as high as in 1991 , yet still 15 percent below the overall german average . he said that the situation for pensioners was particularly improved , with life expectancy increased thanks to better health care .
he also stated that there were now greater similarities in life styles and ideals of citizens from all over germany . bernd grässler -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election campaign heads east german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative rival angela merkel have started their campaigns in the eastern parts of the country .

eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday . diplomats said austria stuck to demands that turkey be offered an explicit alternative to full membership . " unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .

" unfortunately it did n't prove possible today to agreement at ambassador level , " an eu spokesman said , according to reuters .
" efforts will continue , including now at ministerial level . " four decades after ankara first knocked on the rich european club 's door , the negotiations - likely to last at least a decade - are scheduled to begin on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday . while few really expect the talks to be called off , frantic diplomacy seems set to continue down to the wire : eu member states have to unanimously approve the negotiations framework before talks can open . the most resistance is coming from vienna , which openly opposes turkey 's entry bid .
austria objects to the current negotiating framework because in its view the terms do not sufficiently spell out that negotiations could fail .
instead , austria would like turkey to be offered the prospect of something other than full eu membership . europea n support for turkey droppi n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel opposes the eu 's current negotiating framework with turkey " if turkey does not fulfill the criteria , then turkey should be bound in europe by the strongest possible bond , " austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel -lrb- photo -rrb- told the i n ter n atio n al herald tribu n e thursday .
" if the union ca n't absorb turkey , then we are also looking for the strongest possible alternative bond . " germany 's angela merkel , who could possibly be germany 's next chancellor , has been a long-time backer of offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu . " we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering , " merkel said .
" i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership . " a eurobarometer poll in july indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu entry to turkey , with only 35 percent in favor .
public sentiment in france , where voters rejected the european constitution in may largely because of their opposition to turkey 's accession , is at a low point . " turkey is presented like a bitter enemy of europe , " cengiz aktar , director of the eu centre at istanbul 's bahcesehir university , told the afp news agency .
" this has created a bitter and negative environment of which even the most pro-eu circles in turkey have had enough . " a n kara does n ' t guara n tee prese n ce at talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan wants to see what the eu offers before promising to talks officials in ankara also warned they would not accept anything other than complete membership and may stay away from the talks if they deem the negotiating terms unsatisfactory . " it is out of the question that we accept any formula or suggestion other than full membership , " foreign ministry spokesman namik tan told reporters in ankara . turkey first signed an association agreement with the eu 's predecessor in 1963 , and has been a formal eu candidate since 1999 .
last december eu leaders gave ankara an initial green light to start talks on oct .

the berlin-based tabloid b.z. splashed the question on its front page : " schröder resignation on national holiday - monday last day ? "
politicians also believed that schröder would soon resign so that a new german leader can finally be named .
" the necessary clarity can only mean one thing : chancellor gerhard schröder will give up his duties , " michael glos , parliamentary leader of the cdu sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said on german public radio .

in addition , she said there was a " very high possibility " of success of creating a coalition with the social democrats .
guido westerwelle , whose fdp came out as the surprise third-strongest party with almost 10 percent of the vote , thought that result would be more than enough to accompany the conservatives into power .

in the opposition , long-time fdp front man guido westerwelle , who was recently chosen to take over the official job as the party 's parliamentary group leader in may , will have the opportunity to return to the fdp 's core beliefs of business-friendly economic reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle enjoyed good results on election night , but they were n't enough for a coalition with the cdu westerwelle should recognize that his party 's better-than-expected results in september 's federal election was largely thanks to voters jumping ship from merkel 's christian democratic union and hoping for the fdp to push a neo-liberal agenda as the junior player in a cdu-led government . but since he wo n't be sitting next to merkel , it will be much easier for westerwelle and the rest of the fdp to censure whatever reforms the grand coalition passes as not doing enough to help get germany 's economy going . ca n the left party establish itself ? the left party , the new left-wing alliance , is the no. 2 in the rows of the opposition .
as the only party that has bluntly refused social and job market reforms , the left 's two lead horses , oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi , will be left to hope that their rhetorical skills will establish them among the public and drum up more media attention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , left , and oskar lafontaine will try to ingrain the left party in german politics any failures on the part the grand coalition in creating noticeable changes to the job market would benefit the left party most .
should germany 's unemployment continue to run high , lafontaine and gysi can expect voter sympathy to grow and their party to entrench itself in german politics by poaching voters from the spd . gree n s n eed to ope n to cdu the situation of the green party is more complicated .
as part of the last coalition it helped push the reforms that lead chancellor gerhard schröder to call for the vote of confidence that landed them in the opposition .
now it wo n't be so easy for the greens to contradict what they said as part of the government just because it pleases their party base .
that means they 'll be left in the unenviable position between the fdp 's pushing and left party 's pulling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has turned his back to green party leadership positions the greens need to sharpen their image as supporters of the environment and civil rights to have any success in this legislative period .
outgoing foreign minister joschka fisher 's decision to take a seat in the back of the bundestag and not play a major role in the party has n't made his colleagues ' work any easier . if the greens want to drop their persona of only being able to push the spd into power , they 'll have to start what for many will be the ideologically painful process of making concessions to the christian conservatives . a cdu-green coalition would have to be tested in state governments before it is ever seriously considered on a federal scale , and the greens will only be able to start with this strategically necessary choice from the opposition , away from the obligations that come from ruling with the spd . heinz dylong -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .

a team at the institute of tropical medicine , in antwerp , compared hiv-1 samples from 1986-89 and 2002-03 .
they found the newer samples appeared not to multiply as well , and were more sensitive to drugs - some other studies argue they are becoming more resistant .
the researchers , writing in the journal aids , stressed their work in no way meant efforts to prevent the spread of hiv should be scaled down . "
hiv is still a life-threatening infection " keith alcorn they were only able to compare 12 samples from each time period , and they were unable fully to tease out any effect that drug therapy may have had on the virus .
hope for future researcher dr eric arts said : " this was a very preliminary study , but we did find a pretty striking observation in that the viruses from the 2000s are much weaker than the viruses from the eighties .
" obviously this virus is still causing death , although it may be causing death at a slower rate of progression now .
maybe in another 50 to 60 years we might see this virus not causing death . "
keith alcorn , senior editor at the hiv information charity nam , said it had been thought that hiv would increase in virulence as it passed through more and more human hosts .
but the latest study suggested the opposite is actually true .
" what appears to be happening is that by the time hiv passes from one person to another , it has already toned down some of its most pathogenic effects in response to its host 's immune system , " he said .
" so the virus that is passed on is less ' fit ' each time .
" this would suggest that over several generations , hiv could become less harmful to its human hosts .
" however , we are still far from that point - hiv is still a life-threatening infection . "
similar trend dr marco vitoria , an hiv expert at the world health organization , said other diseases - such as smallpox , tb and syphilis - had shown the same tendency to weaken over time .
" there is a natural trend to reach an ' equilibrium ' between the agent and the host interests , in order to guarantee concomitant survival for a longer time , " he said .
however , dr vitoria stressed that the latest findings should not lull people into a false sense of security .
" this kind of change can not be adequately measured in years , but in generations , " he told the bbc news website .
he also questioned whether it was possible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study .
will nutland , of the charity terrence higgins trust , said : " this latest study adds to the debate on an apparently confusing and contradictory issue .
" some studies suggest recent strains of hiv are more sensitive to drugs while others claim strains are becoming more resistant .
" the study adds to the body of evidence but hiv is showing no signs of dying out in the near future . "

" what appears to be happening is that by the time hiv passes from one person to another , it has already toned down some of its most pathogenic effects in response to its host 's immune system , " he said .
" so the virus that is passed on is less ' fit ' each time .
" this would suggest that over several generations , hiv could become less harmful to its human hosts .
" however , we are still far from that point - hiv is still a life-threatening infection . "
similar trend dr marco vitoria , an hiv expert at the world health organization , said other diseases - such as smallpox , tb and syphilis - had shown the same tendency to weaken over time .
" there is a natural trend to reach an ' equilibrium ' between the agent and the host interests , in order to guarantee concomitant survival for a longer time , " he said .
however , dr vitoria stressed that the latest findings should not lull people into a false sense of security .
" this kind of change can not be adequately measured in years , but in generations , " he told the bbc news website .
he also questioned whether it was possible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study .
will nutland , of the charity terrence higgins trust , said : " this latest study adds to the debate on an apparently confusing and contradictory issue .
" some studies suggest recent strains of hiv are more sensitive to drugs while others claim strains are becoming more resistant .
" the study adds to the body of evidence but hiv is showing no signs of dying out in the near future . "

the 4.5bn euro -lrb- £ 2.9bn -rrb- project , dubbed mose - the italian name for moses - is due to be completed by 2011 .
" all doubts have vanished - there is no way back , " mr berlusconi stressed .
environmentalists have criticised the project , and the mayor of venice protested against the decision saying the city council had been bypassed .
the plans envisage building 78 hinged flood barriers on the seabed which would be raised when high tides threaten the city .
but some environmentalists say the 28m -lrb- 92ft -rrb- high , 20m -lrb- 65ft -rrb- wide structures will turn venice into a pond and will cause more damage than the floods which periodically submerge its streets .
the italian section of the world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- says shutting the city 's cargo port and preventing cruise liners from approaching the city would be a more effective way of preventing the damage .
costs , estimated at 2.3bn euros -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- when the first stone was laid in may 2004 , have almost doubled since .
find out how venice will be protected from rising sea levels in pictures anti-globalisation protesters earlier this month staged a protest at the site where the barriers are being build .
frequent floods but mr berlusconi on wednesday made it clear that although some suggestions to improve the project might be discussed with experts and possibly taken into account , they would by no means slow down works on the project .
the decision to protect the lagoon city from high tides was taken in 1966 , when a flood left 5,000 people homeless .
several high tides later , in 1973 , the italian government declared venice to be a matter of national concern .
but it took another 30 years of studies , rejected proposals and debate before a definite plan of action was agreed .
currently , venice suffering some level of flooding for 200 days every year , compared with only seven at the beginning of the 20th century .
more than 50 high tides were recorded between 1993 and 2002 , compared with just five in the 10 years between 1923 and 1932 .
the project is named after moses who , according to the bible , parted the red sea with god 's help .

" the general consensus in swansea is not that there is more domestic abuse taking place , but that reporting is increasing .
" agencies are working in partnership more which improves services and raises public confidence to come forward and report it . "
the conference aims to raise awareness of services available james rowlands , from the dyn project , which helps male victims of abuse in wales , said that raising awareness was very important : " it 's about constantly bringing that message back so people are aware of the services .
" we are seeing more people coming forward .
it is positive that people feel that they can report abuse , and that they feel that society as a whole is taking it seriously . "
swansea council cabinet member for social services , wendy fitzgerald said : " we are delighted to host this opportunity to highlight and build upon the partnership working in swansea to tackle domestic abuse .
" the event has attracted great interest and enthusiasm locally and we are keen to raise the profile of the issues . "
people experiencing domestic abuse can call the wales domestic abuse helpline 0808 80 10 800 -lrb- dial 999 in an emergency -rrb- .

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : " he makes me really proud to be british " lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa " he is a lame-duck leader " john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk " i was impressed by the man " miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey " i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer " a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england " trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour " jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford " i have heard these comments about law and order before " roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire " sounds like a guy in charge to me " vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru " who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ? "
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol " it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners " m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire " has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ? "
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england " make a firm pledge to reduce taxation " john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield " admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed " alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk " he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it " matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa " let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change " matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk " he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces " keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

the prime minister has told labour 's annual conference he will use his last years in downing street to introduce reforms to strengthen the country 's public services .
mr blair also said he wanted his party to make britain at ease with globalisation , forge a new consensus on public services and respond to public anger about crime and anti-social behaviour .
what did you think of mr blair 's speech ?
should he stand down now and let gordon brown take over as prime minister ?
send us your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he makes me really proud to be british lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire tony blair is a leader par excellence .
he makes me really proud to be british .
long may he and his team of stalwarts govern this country .
lucy fernandes , york , n yorkshire blair 's speech was forgettable .
what was far more significant was the treatment of an 82-year-old man who had the audacity to express his views during jack straw 's speech .
this showed the true nature of this corrupt and repulsive government .
john chamberlain , london , uk just another load of posturing .
blair should go , and go soon .
this government 's attack on civil liberties -lrb- detention without trial , id cards etc -rrb- is unacceptable .
if he is allowed to continue we stand to lose much , it 's like the country is signing on the dotted line without reading the small print .
tim , bisterne a great disappointment to those of us who were previously loyal labour voters .
this man is a danger to us all , and the sooner he is gone , the better. peter benjamin , croydon , england blair delivered a speech that promises more reforms , however the only reforms that have made any difference are those brought by gordon brown and without the stability that he has brought to the economy blair would have been left with only the legacy of having taken the country to war on a lie .
brown has proved he can be a true socialist and a steadying hand .
scott douglas , glasgow stay the course , mr blair .
from overseas , i commend you .
in the face of short-sighted emotional rhetoric , you are consistently level headed , morally resilient ... and a marvellously eloquent speaker .
i am always inspired by your words and how well you convey them .
thank you for your steadfast support of our battle against global terrorism .
cheryl , sherman oaks , california , usa he is a lame-duck leader john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk if blair is still at the helm for several more years , labour will lose the next election .
last time he was saved purely by boundary changes in labour 's favour and our disproportional representation system .
iraq is his millstone and will be his tombstone .
he is a lame-duck leader .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk degrees for everything , academies of anything .
are we becoming just another satellite state ? !
mr blair 's government is playing the public off against each other and diverting attention from really important matters and still getting away with it .
what a short memory we have !
owen , wales i do n't think blair has achieved anything much and i 'm not convinced by his slick on-stage persona .
the economic growth of the past eight years in the uk has been cancelled out by a huge concomitant rise in the cost of living ; public services remain mostly second rate ; crime is still as shockingly high as ever ; and foreign policy has left britain vulnerable to terrorism .
if tony blair were a gentleman , he 'd pack his bags graciously and let someone else have a go - but unfortunately , he is n't .
matthew smith , london , uk i was impressed by the man miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia this is the first time in my life i carefully watched a political speech .
i am the 1955 generation and i switch the channel automatically when i see a man in suit talking about a better life .
but after his first sentence i was hypnotized .
i was impressed by the man .
i think he is a great politician and has a vision and courage more than any man in current word politics .
miroslav cicak , belgrade , serbia thank you tony for showing your true colours today !
what an appalling sight to see an 82-year-old man manhandled out of your conference for having an opinion .
freedom of speech ?
not for that poor soul .
thanks again for showing us what new labour really stands for .
you want to look so good to the world at large that you are sacrificing your country for your ego ! !
bea , middlesex mr blair has fallen into the same trap as mrs thatcher , believing his own spin doctors .
since 1997 he and the party in the main have been the tory party dressed in red .
his speech shows he has lost touch with the people on some of the main subjects of the day .
his comments on iraq could have been written by maggie 's writers in her heyday .
john smith must be turning in his grave to see what has happened to the party he should have led to power .
n. earl , surrey i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer a thomas , ruislip , middlesex i am no fan of tony blair but he is a consummate political performer with the ability to empathise with ordinary people .
compare that with the dour desperation with which brown is seeking blair 's job .
someone should tell gordon brown that if he wants to be pm he should win it in a general election not demand to be appointed .
the blair versus brown debate is hilarious .
wait for them to fall out again .
a thomas , ruislip , middlesex the hardworking people of this country already pay a bucketful in taxes .
now on top of that , they 're being asked to pay for if they want to see a doctor or dentist .
if we have to pay for it , can we please have huge a reduction in taxes ?
mr blair should quit now .
sally cooke , newcastle , uk since you only broadcast mini-sound bites of the blair speech it seems wrong to ask people to comment .
perhaps you should consider what proportion of a speech should be available to viewers before asking their opinion .
i would suggest that the proportion you broadcast is 5 % , or considerably less .
is this a ' fair ' basis for viewers to give a reasoned opinion ?
richard white , chiang mai , thailand i have been a labour member for several years now and the thing that sticks in my mind from this conference is how detached from reality the union leaders still are .
do they really think we live in a place where any political party could support a return to legal secondary action ?
the fights they seem to be squaring up to on public sector pensions etc are going to have so little public support as to be laughed at .
mark , evesham i am a socialist , and tony blair is outstanding .he and margaret thatcher stand supreme among leaders .
his greatest achievement , by far , has been to drag the political luddites in his party - so long the despair of us all - into this era .
ross , hereford , england trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour jenny , farnworth i thought mr blair 's speech was very good , well written and well delivered .
trouble is that sound bites and speeches are all you get from tony blair and labour .
education , crime and the nhs are as disastrous as they were , there are still far too many people abusing the benefits system and the rest of us are still fed up with pouring money in and seeing no improvement .
in conclusion , great speech but we 'll all just be expecting more of the same .
jenny , farnworth i 'm a labour voter and was disappointed that his speech indicated so strongly that he intends to serve a full third term .
we lost a lot of terrific mps at the last election - many of whom would still be in parliament today if he had done the honourable thing and stepped down as pm last year .
i think we will win the next election but if blair stays on we will scrape through with an even smaller majority .
paul , southend-on-sea , uk perhaps he should spend the £ 16 billion he wants to spend on id cards on more police , cleaner hospitals , higher pensions , lower tax , better roads , more punctual trains , reducing student debt and cheaper fuel ?
would that be a little bit too radical ?
arron clements , coventry uk there is no politician in britain that comes close to tony blair 's talents and stature - and the labour party activists know it .
without him there would have been no three election victories .
it is blair who has given gordon brown the time and space to conduct his economic redistribution policies .
i hope he stays in power for as long as possible because i do n't see any natural successor with blair 's appeal .
fran , london , uk i was appalled to find that he had not mentioned university tuition fees at all .
this is very bad for him indeed , no wonder he side stepped the issue .
also , why did he leave out southampton from his list of great uk cities ?
shocking !
i wo n't be voting for labour ever again .
k abraham , southampton i have been a labour supporter all my adult life .
i was overjoyed in 1997 to think i would at last see a proper social democratic government in britain .
i 'm still waiting .
meanwhile things go on as if the tories were still there .
i do not want any more of his ' reforms ' .
harriet , worcester tony blair speaks as if a different party has been in power for the last 8 years , and he now has to clear up the mess .
jack hughes , huddersfield uk as an academic exercise in presentation it was worth nine out of ten .
however , in ten days we will not remember a word of it .
this evangelical " wind-up " of a small club of activists is a travesty of the principles of democracy .
john y , oxford " i will never allow the nhs to charge for treatment " .
these are the words of pm tony blair at the conference .
i have had a nhs dentist for 17 years but the practice has now decided to go private .
they have offered me an insurance policy .
the only loser is the patient : the dentist earns more and the insurance company make a profit .
free nhs ?
i think not .
richard gulliver , thornbury i think tony blair is doing a good job but i think that the young people of britain deserve a bit more of a say ; after all we are the future .
hollie pinder , bexhill-on-sea , east sussex the bit that struck me was blair 's statement that while it was important not to convict the innocent , it was n't the main priority of the criminal justice system .
given his government 's attacks on jury trial , the double jeopardy rule , habeas corpus and so forth , and his repeated support for what amounts to internment , i suppose we should n't be surprised .
will any civil liberties be left by the time he 's done ?
douglas , guildford , gb i welcome the modernisation of public services .
particularly health , i would applaud investment in our hospitals if it is done wisely .
there was no mention in tony blair 's speech about the thousands of people who die or are harmed by mrsa .
clean up and modernise the hospitals and make the staff proud to work in the nhs .
maria cann , bristol mr blair 's speech was that of a leader .
whether you agree with it or not .
mr brown is not a leader , seems to me that labour would be the same as all the other parties if mr brown was the leader .
mr brown stick to what you know - chancellor !
david darwent , sheffield choice costs money !
too many choices confuse people .
look at the mess of the complex care legislation .
families are bewildered when trying to choose their options when placing the elderly into care .
mr blair is only interested in his place in history books but meantime we all have to deal with all the change .
s wallace , scotland i thought blair 's speech was brilliantly composed and consummately delivered .
he looks at the peak of his powers , head and shoulders above anyone else in the upper echelons of british politics , including gordon brown .
but what 's he doing leading the labour party ?
he 's unequivocally a " change-making " tory !
john taylor , sheffield , uk i 'm puzzled by those who regard blair as a tory .
his record on taxing and spending without regard for value for money , or for peoples ' ability to pay is pure old labour .
also , he wants to interfere in people 's lives in a way that is decidely un-tory .
matthew boult , chandlers ford i have heard these comments about law and order before roger sharman , esher surrey i have heard these comments about law and order before but there has been no difference .
in fact the breakdown in law and order has got worse .
he must definitely drop the " human rights " bill and think about the good of the community and victim instead of the criminal .
i notice the question of europe did not come up much .
is he still going to have a referendum on entry to the euro ?
also nothing mentioned about controlling illegal immigration which is still a major problem .
altogether a lot of hot air but no substance .
sorry i was a labour supporter but no more .
roger sharman , esher surrey what is wrong with you people ?
whatever tony blair says you criticize , so , what are you hoping the leader to do for you ?
although he is not a perfect leader , but blair is the one who can run this government better than the conservatives and lib dems , so be fair .
hemin mahmoud , croydon tony blair is now too far removed from the pulse of the nation .
unfortunately i suspect that the labout party may suffer from a similar affliction .
this country needs a new leader - no-one has yet been able to rise to the challenge .
rob , cambridgeshire sounds like a guy in charge to me vince , cov uk sounds like a guy in charge to me , the best prime minister for generations .
he indulges in joined-up politics at home and abroad with absolute commitment .
it will be pity to see him go .
vince , cov uk why is choice so important - surely if sevices were good choice would be irrelevant ?
i do n't care who treats my illness / empties my bins / puts out fires or whatever as long as it gets done properly .
putting elements of choice in encourages competitors to seek shortcuts & affects quality of services as far as i can see .
andy bryceland , greenock i listened to the speech and i see a man who is very passionate about the united kingdom , about the regions , about the people and about our future .
this government has achieved a lot and it is also true that we run ourselves down .
when we got the 2012 olympics , i was overjoyed .
at long last the united kingdom has leapfrogged from the 19th century directly into the 21st century .
aaron , se london if tony blair does n't give way for gordon brown now , there will be a landslide defeat at the next general election .
many labour supporters voted only because they believed he would be quickly replaced by gordon brown .
we 're still waiting .
mary o 'brien , edinburgh , scotland as an ex-pat , tony blair has given britain a younger more dynamic face than before .
the rest of the world respects britain a lot more than 15 years ago .
tony blair has had a pivotal role in reducing debt in the poorest countries - that just would n't have been possible by any other leader .
bernard shiner , lima , peru who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
roy jones , whittlesey who told tony blair that we want choice in the nhs ?
i want choice when i shop or travel .
but when i 'm ill , i expect my gp to know where the best treatment is available and send me there .
how on earth would i know if some other hospital or some other specialist is better ?
walter schwarz , colchester uk is n't it time blair did what he was elected for - to run this country for the benefit of its people - rather than pursue his own agenda in the international arena ?
roy jones , whittlesey , cambs .
who needs a conservative party when we have a pale version of it running the country at present ?
blair is the best tory leader the tories never had .
there are only two parties now in the uk , the lib dems and the combined labour / tory .
with blair 's commitment to privatisation , the ghost of thatcher rears its ugly head .
thomas lowry , leeds uk energy .
the uk is facing a looming energy crisis .
depleting north sea gas will soon create both gas and electricity shortages .
nuclear decommission will remove still more electricity supply .
keeping the lights on is the largest challenge over the coming decade .
chris vernon , bristol it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners m price , coventry it 's about time that tony blair started to look after the pensioners as they are the ones who have fought for this country .
he should now give them a better pension rise .
m price , coventry , uk he should take some responsibility for the situation in iraq .
it is maddening the way in which he thinks he can just front it out ignoring popular opinion .
that no one in government has resigned is a miracle .
roger , edinburgh he should finally admit that he is a conservative , as he does n't seem much like a socialist to me like labour should be .
ian purnell , maastricht holland mr blair should announce britain 's withdrawal from the european convention on human rights and from the geneva convention so that we can more effectively fight the terrorists in our midst without them exploiting the legal system to evade facing justice .
unshackle us please , mr. blair .
jamie shepherd , uk while i 'd rather see the conservatives in power , blair should continue his plans to combat terrorism .
to retreat now from iraq or from the recently-proposed anti-terror laws would be a betrayal of the british people .
he won the election , and so has the right and duty to protect his people .
craig , durban , south africa a word or two about how his government are going to tackle the outrageous rip off that is poll tax , er sorry , council tax would be nice .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years ?
vincent , london has n't blair been promising radical reform for almost 10 years now ?
since labour came to power , i have seen them capitulate on virtually every piece of radical reform when outcry ensued .
it is impossible to please everybody , but in the midst of all the promises of radical reform , surely at some stage there must actually be delivery .
hopefully mr blair will some to realise that vision without action is simply a daydream , while action without vision is a nightmare .
vincent , london it would be nice to hear plans about streamlining or reforming the council tax system , especially addressing the issue of council 's raising the amounts 20 % above inflation every year .
i imagine it will be business as usual .
matthew higgins , winnersh , uk i would like him to say " i will put the wishes of the electorate ahead of the wishes of mr. bush " .
buzz , glasgow what a great success this government has been .
low inflation , unemployment , a minimum wage , better public services etc .
we are definitely better off now than .
sarah , hemel hempstead , herts he should do the honourable thing and resign .
then he should join the tory party where belongs and give us the labour party back .
and i am not an extreme lefty either .
alex goodwin , newcastle upon tyne , england make a firm pledge to reduce taxation john , leicester he should make a firm pledge to reduce taxation .
ideally council tax or any other tax , just something that will make a noticeable difference to the ordinary bloke in the street .
john , leicester all this talk of when tony blair might stand down is a red herring .
he is determined to be in power longer than margaret thatcher .
as she was prime minister for 11 years and 209 days -lrb- approximately 11 years and seven months -rrb- , it goes without argument that tony will not stand down much before he has served for at least the same length of time , i.e. until late november 2008 .
anyone want to take bets ?
bernard cooper , birmingham , england i 'm shocked tony has not mentioned his plans for the forthcoming energy crisis .
this is probably the biggest problem to have ever faced the country although no one wants to talk about it .
jamie , gloucester , glos how about a pledge to commit to a sustainable economy not based upon bloated public sector jobs and rampant but dwindling consumerism ?
jules , surrey he should explain why the gap between rich and poor has got bigger under labour , and why britain has the worst record of upward mobility in europe , even worse than the us !
julian thomas , barcelona , -lrb- expat -rrb- that troops will be home from the gulf by christmas .
chris , uk perhaps he should talk about changing parliamentary proceedings so that different policies could be debated individually on their merits and voted upon in the house , rather than mulled over in closed committees or think tanks and then bundled together into a single massive bill , usually with some unpleasant ideas hidden inside .
perhaps then dissenters could be heard properly rather than just being accused of wrecking " good " legislation because they managed to read the small print in time .
stuart whyte , chelmsford , uk back in ' 97 , blair had a golden opportunity to undo 18 years of tory rule and sweep away all the greed and self interest that came with those times .
by my calculations , we 've now had 26 years of continuous conservative government .
david , bracknell , berkshire it seems to me that tony blair has got one eye on mrs thatcher 's record-breaking stint as prime minister .
i 'm pretty sure he 'll cheerfully stand aside once he has surpassed her record in 2008 .
as for his successor , we must wait and see .
gordon brown is not the only credible candidate .
i only hope he 'll be prepared to stay on as chancellor if his hopes are dashed .
kelly mouser , upminster , essex fed up with these politicians who promise to " to step up reform " .. that 's what they get paid to do ... so the question is , what have they been paid to do until now , if they are only looking at stepping up reforms now ? !
xavier , london he should admit that the reason this country is in the state it is because he and his party have been so preoccupied with making things look good on paper that they have n't given a blind bit of thought or concern to the reality of life in britain .
we do n't care if you can show us a pie chart , or some report your friend has written - we care about what we see outside our front door , how we are treated in hospital , what we see in our bank balances , and the troops we see in our graveyards .
louise , canterbury , kent how can he justify paying senior civil servants and management consultants huge bonuses , wasting millions on flawed it systems -lrb- csa for one -rrb- and not increasing pensions or basic wages .
he and his cronies are totally out of touch with the day to day economic reality for average earners outside of london .
we get no allowances for living in the south east but pay london prices .
you said you would listen mr blair , well maybe you need to clean your ears out .
mr fed up , hastings , east sussex tony blair will concentrate on the jobs in hand rather than outlining the timetable for his departure .
he has gained an utmost respect from the public , his colleagues and other parties for his vision and their deliveries throughout his tenure .
he should continue doing so for the remaining period of the third term .
he has taken some decisions for the benefit for his country and he should stand by those decisions .
public , sooner or later , will realise his hard decisions have kept the whole country one step ahead on the international level .
we are also better off domestically almost in all the areas including health , education , security , etc .
om choudhary , herts he should tell us why he does not introduce workhouses for the lazy people in the country - we need to look backwards for ideas , it worked for the victorians and it can work for us .
ian corrigan , glasgow tony blair will be viewed by history as one of our greatest prime ministers .
why ca n't he get the recognition he deserves ?
i blame some sections of the media .
mg shaw , lichfield admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed alan , crawley first admit that all the planned reforms are critically flawed then admit that outsourcing it was the biggest mistake that government has ever made and then finally admit that using management consultants instead of equally if not better trained civil servants is an absolutely disgusting waste of money .
it 'll never happen , the public services in this country are being butchered to a standard thatcher would be happy with .
oh , another thing that would be nice is the government to admit it has failed to cut red tape drastically and that it has actually got worse with statistics being an almost full time burden on civil servants who now spend more time doing statistics than meaningful work .
alan , crawley it 's ridiculous and vain of gordon brown to think that he will ever be a better leader than tony blair .
dave sandford , london he should say exactly what he is going to do about global warming and weaning the country off oil .
actual , tangible , immediate action ; not more waffle .
stu , bristol , uk i abdicate , -lrb- in the same manner is margaret thatcher did -rrb- .
well he is mrs thatcher with trousers on - a quote from the splendid andrew marr .
andy g , bristol , england help for single people !
i work for the nhs , struggle to afford rent , bills and food most months !
fed up with baked beans for tea - help needed .
suzy , northampton whatever he says , it will be just words .
his latest u-turn is on climate change .
at a time when this issue is becoming increasingly more important , he has backtracked from former statements and is now going along once again with the policies of bush .
mike , portsmouth , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it matt , sussex , uk he should say : " right .
here i am , what do you want me to do ? "
then he should go away and do it .
not waste our time and money on mere rhetoric .
he made us promises and they have not come to fruition .
he said " education , education , education " then sold off our playing fields and closed down the underperforming schools .
he should also say : " i 'm not going to suck up to bush anymore " as we are in danger of losing our national pride and identity .
tony , you are the prime minister of the uk .
do your job or go away .
we do n't work for you , you work for us .
matt , sussex , uk tony blair has wasted the greatest opportunity given to a politician in ages .
with good will and a massive majority he could have made a real difference , he chose not to .
gordon brown 's pledge to continue blair 's work means that we can look forward to more of the same .
it does not matter whether blair stays or goes the song is the same .
chris parker , bucks there is a current theme on ' respect ' at the moment .
i think the prime minister needs to acknowledge that respect means should include all those who did not vote for him , those who live in the countryside , those who disagreed with the war in iraq , those pensioners who have a small increase in their state pensions but massive outgoings in their bills .
yes , he should acknowledge all that and then say sorry .
andrew , london , uk he should explain the following story on your website today " official figures show £ 1.86bn went to members of the management consultancies association in 2004-05 - an increase of £ 590m , or 46 % , on 2003-04 " and why the response was that this was money well spent .
paul , manchester i am not interested in what mr blair has to say , i am more interested in what he can deliver .
colin , swindon , uk so mr blair wants us to have even more reform of public services .
instead of continually reinventing the wheel , i think we should have some major reform of parliament , government , and the british constitution .
it is ridiculous that we have a monarchy that does not get involved in politics , while the effective head of state is elected by just a few thousand of his local constituents .
lorraine bliss , leamington spa let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change matthew clarkson , exeter let 's hope blair announces some reforms that actually reduce taxation for a change , although ' flying pigs seen in brighton ' is a more likely headline .
matthew clarkson , exeter why should tony blair go at all ?
he is the best we have ever had and there is no one who could do his job better .
let us for once keep this country in the same hands .
keep changing the leaders of this country does no good at all .
we need consistency in the running of the country and tony blair is that man .
mrs l north , canterbury britain a bit of wishful thinking perhaps but would n't it be nice if he would pledge to find a chancellor who knows how to balance the nation 's books ?
darrel humphreys , cardiff , uk he 's done a good stint and it 's taking its toll .
look at the picture .
he should say ' goodbye . '
joanna w , uk although the country is wealthy and employment is low , the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and our public services are slowly being sold off .
i would like him to admit that he 's a tory and change sides !
rob bowley , london " i have thought long and hard about the issue and realise that id cards would be overly expensive and do nothing to stop the threat of terrorism or immigration . "
al , t 'wells , uk whatever he says , the pauses will be longer than the content .
simon mallett , maidstone , uk how about reforming the voting system to make it more democratic ?
tony is currently in power because of a mere 35 % of the popular vote ; 65 % of the population did not vote for him .
about time we had proportional representation of a sort , is n't it ?
d holdsworth , manchester , uk i 'd be happy to see him commit to keeping our current ' first past the post ' voting system , using the mess that proportional representation has caused in germany as his justification .
compulsory voting should be part of that commitment , with a ' none of the above ' option so everybody 's view is known .
and to d. holdsworth , if i was in blair 's position , i would counter your assessment of the election result by pointing out that 75 % of the electorate did not vote against him , implying they are happy with his performance -lrb- and no , i 'm am most definitely not a labour - new or otherwise - supporter -rrb- .
andrew , brighton , england how about giving some support to those of us who are single and who do not have children ?
we are entitled to no benefits , no tax relief and are constantly expected to pay more and more for those who see this country as a free meal ticket for the rest of them and to support their uncontrolled production of offspring .
the only change in public services blair has introduced in the last 8 years is for everything to cost more , petrol and bus / train fares alike .
i am not hopeful this will change .
sara , birmingham , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces keith , uk he should commit to spending more time looking after the many problems the uk currently faces and stop trying to fix every problem around the world .
seem to remember that being a promise in the general election , but i suppose that has now been dropped .
keith , uk tony is spot on .
to all the detractors ; take a look at this country , it 's in the best position , in most aspects , than it has ever been .
darren hodkinson , manchester , england he should say that the british people will elect the next prime minister not the labour party .
it is arrogant beyond believe to think that blair can simply hand over the title - we are supposed to live in a democracy .
tom , ipswich , uk the words " sorry " and " good bye " comes to mind .
we have wasted 8 years on these people .
spending and the national debt have rocketed thanks to labour , and we are still yet to see any benefits .
to top it off , they now want us to work until we are 70 !
alfie noakes , north of england , uk i 'm sure he 'll keep well away from iraq .
and probably push id cards and new terror laws as a way to keep terrorists away from england .
as a lame duck pm i 'm sure he 'll also propose a new worldwide vision for helping the poor - again .
salik rafiq , blackburn i expect it will be the same rubbish that he always spouts with a huge dose of spin for the media to get to grips with .
the fact that bit by bit our nhs is being sold off - bit by bit will probably be ignored for the usual brown vs blair which is getting especially dull .
i 'd like to see some of the backbenchers speak out for keeping labour principles to let tony know he is not going to get everything his own way - at least without a fight stephen thompson , newcastle , uk he should apologise for the mess he 's created in iraq and tell us what he proposes to do about it .
tod , barnstaple blair should say : sorry about the war , i resign .
peter howe , milton keynes , england how about i 'm going to spend more time in the uk devoting my time to its myriad problems instead of globe-trotting to sort out everyone else 's ?

bbc monitoring looks at some of the key issues in thursday 's vote .
q. what does president abdelaziz bouteflika hope to achieve ?
president bouteflika says the adoption of the charter for peace and national reconciliation will turn the page on over a decade of conflict in algeria , which has claimed 150,000 lives and cost the country more than $ 30bn .
the violence broke out between islamic militants and government forces after the authorities scrapped an election in 1992 which the main islamic party , the islamic salvation front -lrb- fis -rrb- was set to win .
q. what are the key points of the charter ?
it ends judicial proceedings for all those who laid down their weapons in 1999 , following the president 's clemency law , and those who vow to lay down their weapons now .
it excludes individuals who were involved in massacres , rapes and who carried out bombings in public places .
it rejects claims that security forces were responsible for the disappearance of thousands of algerians .
it provides for reparations for families of disappeared .
q : what is the current state of security ?
the run-up to the referendum has seen an upsurge in attacks by islamists .
interior minister yazid zerhouni said recently 800 to 1,000 militants were still active in the country .
q : what does the opposition say ?
several opposition parties have called for a boycott of the referendum .
some critics have said the charter is an attempt by the president to boost his own power .
and one major opposition figure , hocine ait ahmed , of the front for socialist forces , accused president bouteflika of holding the referendum " to blot out past crimes " .
part of the charter says : " the algerian people praise the algerian national army , the security forces as well as all the patriots and anonymous citizens who ... saved algeria and its institutions . "
opponents say that without justice , there can be no reconciliation .
they want the authorities to account for thousands of people who disappeared during the conflict .
q : were opponents allowed to campaign against ?
no opposing views have been aired on national radio or tv .
the algerian human rights league has complained of alleged harassment of opponents of the charter , such as organisations representing persons who disappeared during the conflict .
q : what is the likely outcome ?
the bbc 's correspondent in algiers says the mood on the streets is one of unenthusiastic endorsement , but many algerians seem likely to vote yes to the referendum , simply because they are tired of years of violence .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- inside the secretive bilderberg group home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages espanol brazil caribbean more last updated : thursday , 29 september 2005 , 07:42 gmt 08:42 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version inside the secretive bilderberg group how much influence do private networks of the rich and powerful have on government policies and international relations ?
one group , the bilderberg , has often attracted speculation that it forms a shadowy global government .
as part of the bbc 's who runs your world ? series , bill hayton tries to find out more .
bilderberg 's head viscount davignon plays down the group 's role in setting the international agenda the chairman of the secretive - he prefers the word private - bilderberg group is 73-year-old viscount etienne davignon , corporate director and former european commissioner .
in his office , on a private floor above the brussels office of the suez conglomerate lined with political cartoons of himself , he told me what he thought of allegations that bilderberg is a global conspiracy secretly ruling the world .
" it is unavoidable and it does n't matter , " he says .
" there will always be people who believe in conspiracies but things happen in a much more incoherent fashion . "
lack of publicity in an extremely rare interview , he played down the importance of bilderberg in setting the international agenda .
" what can come out of our meetings is that it is wrong not to try to deal with a problem .
but a real consensus , an action plan containing points 1 , 2 and 3 ?
the answer is no .
people are much too sensible to believe they can do that . "
there need to be places where these people can think about the main challenges ahead , co-ordinate where policies should be going , and find out where there could be a consensus professor kees van der pijl every year since 1954 , a small network of rich and powerful people have held a discussion meeting about the state of the trans-atlantic alliance and the problems facing europe and the us .
organised by a steering committee of two people from each of about 18 countries , the bilderberg group -lrb- named after the dutch hotel in which it held its first meeting -rrb- brings together about 120 leading business people and politicians .
at this year 's meeting in germany , the audience included the heads of the world bank and european central bank , chairmen or chief executives from nokia , bp , unilever , daimlerchrysler and pepsi - among other multi-national corporations , editors from five major newspapers , members of parliament , ministers , european commissioners , the crown prince of belgium and the queen of the netherlands .
" i do n't think -lrb- we are -rrb- a global ruling class because i do n't think a global ruling class exists .
i simply think it 's people who have influence interested to speak to other people who have influence , " viscount davignon says .
bill clinton was featured at a bilderberg meeting while he was governor of arkansas " bilderberg does not try to reach conclusions - it does not try to say ' what we should do ' .
everyone goes away with their own feeling and that allows the debate to be completely open , quite frank - and to see what the differences are .
" business influences society and politics influences society - that 's purely common sense .
it 's not that business contests the right of democratically-elected leaders to lead " .
for bilderberg 's critics the fact that there is almost no publicity about the annual meetings is proof that they are up to no good .
jim tucker , editor of a right-wing newspaper , the american free press for example , alleges they organise wars and elect and depose political leaders .
he describes the group as simply ' evil ' .
so where does the truth lie ?
professor kees van der pijl of sussex university in britain says such private networks of corporate and political leaders play an informal but crucial role in the modern world .
" there need to be places where these people can think about the main challenges ahead , co-ordinate where policies should be going , and find out where there could be a consensus . "
' common sense ' will hutton , an economic analyst and former newspaper editor who attended a bilderberg meeting in 1997 , says people take part in these networks in order to influence the way the world works , to create what he calls " the international common sense " about policy .
business influences society and politics influences society - that 's purely common sense " on every issue that might influence your business you will hear at first-hand the people who are actually making those decisions and you will play a part in helping them to make those decisions and formulating the common sense , " he says .
and that " common sense " is one which supports the interests of bilderberg 's main participants - in particular free trade .
viscount davignon says that at the annual meetings , " automatically around the table you have internationalists " - people who support the work of the world trade organisation , trans-atlantic co-operation and european integration .
bilderberg meetings often feature future political leaders shortly before they become household names .
bill clinton went in 1991 while still governor of arkansas , tony blair was there two years later while still an opposition mp .
all the recent presidents of the european commission attended bilderberg meetings before they were appointed .
' secret government ' this has led to accusations that the group pushes its favoured politicians into high office .
but viscount davignon says his steering committee are simply excellent talent spotters .
the steering committee " does its best assessment of who are the bright new boys or girls in the beginning phase of their career who would like to get known . "
" it 's not a total accident , but it 's not a forecast and if they go places it 's not because of bilderberg , it 's because of themselves , " viscount davignon says .
but its critics say bilderberg 's selection process gives an extra boost to aspiring politicians whose views are friendly to big business .
none of this , however , is easy to prove - or disprove .
observers like will hutton argue that such private networks have both good and bad sides .
they are unaccountable to voters but , at the same time , they do keep the international system functioning .
and there are limits to their power - a point which bilderberg chairman was keen to stress , " when people say this is a secret government of the world i say that if we were a secret government of the world we should be bloody ashamed of ourselves . "
informal and private networks like bilderberg have helped to oil the wheels of global politics and globalisation for the past half a century .
in the eyes of critics they have undermined democracy , but their supporters believe they are crucial to modern democracy 's success .
and so long as business and politics remain mutually dependent , they will continue to thrive .

at this year 's meeting in germany , the audience included the heads of the world bank and european central bank , chairmen or chief executives from nokia , bp , unilever , daimlerchrysler and pepsi - among other multi-national corporations , editors from five major newspapers , members of parliament , ministers , european commissioners , the crown prince of belgium and the queen of the netherlands .
" i do n't think -lrb- we are -rrb- a global ruling class because i do n't think a global ruling class exists .
i simply think it 's people who have influence interested to speak to other people who have influence , " viscount davignon says .
bill clinton was featured at a bilderberg meeting while he was governor of arkansas " bilderberg does not try to reach conclusions - it does not try to say ' what we should do ' .
everyone goes away with their own feeling and that allows the debate to be completely open , quite frank - and to see what the differences are .
" business influences society and politics influences society - that 's purely common sense .
it 's not that business contests the right of democratically-elected leaders to lead " .
for bilderberg 's critics the fact that there is almost no publicity about the annual meetings is proof that they are up to no good .
jim tucker , editor of a right-wing newspaper , the american free press for example , alleges they organise wars and elect and depose political leaders .
he describes the group as simply ' evil ' .
so where does the truth lie ?
professor kees van der pijl of sussex university in britain says such private networks of corporate and political leaders play an informal but crucial role in the modern world .
" there need to be places where these people can think about the main challenges ahead , co-ordinate where policies should be going , and find out where there could be a consensus . "
' common sense ' will hutton , an economic analyst and former newspaper editor who attended a bilderberg meeting in 1997 , says people take part in these networks in order to influence the way the world works , to create what he calls " the international common sense " about policy .
business influences society and politics influences society - that 's purely common sense " on every issue that might influence your business you will hear at first-hand the people who are actually making those decisions and you will play a part in helping them to make those decisions and formulating the common sense , " he says .
and that " common sense " is one which supports the interests of bilderberg 's main participants - in particular free trade .
viscount davignon says that at the annual meetings , " automatically around the table you have internationalists " - people who support the work of the world trade organisation , trans-atlantic co-operation and european integration .
bilderberg meetings often feature future political leaders shortly before they become household names .
bill clinton went in 1991 while still governor of arkansas , tony blair was there two years later while still an opposition mp .
all the recent presidents of the european commission attended bilderberg meetings before they were appointed .
' secret government ' this has led to accusations that the group pushes its favoured politicians into high office .
but viscount davignon says his steering committee are simply excellent talent spotters .
the steering committee " does its best assessment of who are the bright new boys or girls in the beginning phase of their career who would like to get known . "
" it 's not a total accident , but it 's not a forecast and if they go places it 's not because of bilderberg , it 's because of themselves , " viscount davignon says .
but its critics say bilderberg 's selection process gives an extra boost to aspiring politicians whose views are friendly to big business .
none of this , however , is easy to prove - or disprove .
observers like will hutton argue that such private networks have both good and bad sides .
they are unaccountable to voters but , at the same time , they do keep the international system functioning .
and there are limits to their power - a point which bilderberg chairman was keen to stress , " when people say this is a secret government of the world i say that if we were a secret government of the world we should be bloody ashamed of ourselves . "
informal and private networks like bilderberg have helped to oil the wheels of global politics and globalisation for the past half a century .
in the eyes of critics they have undermined democracy , but their supporters believe they are crucial to modern democracy 's success .
and so long as business and politics remain mutually dependent , they will continue to thrive .

' secret government ' this has led to accusations that the group pushes its favoured politicians into high office .
but viscount davignon says his steering committee are simply excellent talent spotters .
the steering committee " does its best assessment of who are the bright new boys or girls in the beginning phase of their career who would like to get known . "
" it 's not a total accident , but it 's not a forecast and if they go places it 's not because of bilderberg , it 's because of themselves , " viscount davignon says .
but its critics say bilderberg 's selection process gives an extra boost to aspiring politicians whose views are friendly to big business .
none of this , however , is easy to prove - or disprove .
observers like will hutton argue that such private networks have both good and bad sides .
they are unaccountable to voters but , at the same time , they do keep the international system functioning .
and there are limits to their power - a point which bilderberg chairman was keen to stress , " when people say this is a secret government of the world i say that if we were a secret government of the world we should be bloody ashamed of ourselves . "
informal and private networks like bilderberg have helped to oil the wheels of global politics and globalisation for the past half a century .
in the eyes of critics they have undermined democracy , but their supporters believe they are crucial to modern democracy 's success .
and so long as business and politics remain mutually dependent , they will continue to thrive .

since september , teachers in wales and england have been allowed time away from the class for " planning , preparation and assessment " .
some head teachers warn the rules could prevent pe teachers being released .
the welsh assembly government said there was nothing in the new agreement which meant schools needed to change their timetables to exclude sport .
the nasuwt union said options were available to sort out any problems .
under the new workload agreement , teachers are entitled to 10 % of the timetable free from teaching in the classroom to plan lessons .
at ysgol friars in bangor , the new so-called " non contact " periods means that 32 out of the 92 staff are unavailable to teach at any one time .
" we have had to cut down on the number of activities the school can take part in , as every teacher we have is entitled to two non-contact periods within the week , " said head teacher neil foden . "
this is bound to have an effect on the health of pupils " dewi miles , school rugby team coach " i 've just spent eight and a half hours trying to sort it out , but the knock-on is that some activities , such as sports are bound to be affected .
" it 's not such a problem now because games such as rugby and football between different schools can be played after school hours , but from mid november onwards when the hours of daylight are reduced these games will not take place . "
mr foden added that there were financial implications to the changes too .
he said the school had already spent £ 40,000 from its budget to employ two extra teachers as " floating supply " to try and cope with the situation .
he warned that crisis point could be reached in january and february , the months when the number of days off due to illnesses are at their highest .
his comments are backed by haydn davies , headteacher at llangefni secondary school , who is also a wru premier-level rugby referee .
the new rules affect more than just sports but activities which are connected to academic work - such as theatre visits - will get priority .
mr davies said : " one way around this would be for each school to rota the pe teacher off on wednesday afternoons , but so far not every school in the area has been able to do so and this means not every school team is available for fixtures .
" i do n't think the ramifications of this change were worked through beforehand " .
dewi miles , rugby team coach at ysgol john bright in llandudno , said he is worried it could affect fitness and health of pupils if it school sports are hit .
teething problems mr miles said : " because children will lose out on the disicpline of turning up for coaching sessions and games they will find something else to do - play on the computer or worse " .
however , the teaching union nasuwt in wales believes any difficulties are purely " teething problems " and the benefits to teachers far outweigh any disadvantages .
" the answer at the end of the day is in the hands of the individual headmasters , " said geraint davies , union secretary in wales .
additional £ 70m " there are a number of options open to them so that they can release teachers .
" this is a statutory requirement and it has undoubtebly improved the lives of teachers . "
the welsh assembly government said it was providing an additional £ 70m by next year to support the changes .
" there is nothing in the workload agreement which says that school need to change their timetables to exclude sporting activities , " said a spokesman .
" we know of schools in wales where there has been significant progress in implementing the agreement .
" they have broadened the range of experiences and learning available to their pupils within the school day , whilst meeting the requirement of the agreement " .

at ysgol friars in bangor , the new so-called " non contact " periods means that 32 out of the 92 staff are unavailable to teach at any one time .
" we have had to cut down on the number of activities the school can take part in , as every teacher we have is entitled to two non-contact periods within the week , " said head teacher neil foden .
this is bound to have an effect on the health of pupils dewi miles , school rugby team coach " i 've just spent eight and a half hours trying to sort it out , but the knock-on is that some activities , such as sports are bound to be affected .
" it 's not such a problem now because games such as rugby and football between different schools can be played after school hours , but from mid november onwards when the hours of daylight are reduced these games will not take place . "
mr foden added that there were financial implications to the changes too .
he said the school had already spent £ 40,000 from its budget to employ two extra teachers as " floating supply " to try and cope with the situation .
he warned that crisis point could be reached in january and february , the months when the number of days off due to illnesses are at their highest .
his comments are backed by haydn davies , headteacher at llangefni secondary school , who is also a wru premier-level rugby referee .
the assembly government said sport should not be excluded under the new system the new rules affect more than just sports but activities which are connected to academic work - such as theatre visits - will get priority .
mr davies said : " one way around this would be for each school to rota the pe teacher off on wednesday afternoons , but so far not every school in the area has been able to do so and this means not every school team is available for fixtures .
" i do n't think the ramifications of this change were worked through beforehand " .
dewi miles , rugby team coach at ysgol john bright in llandudno , said he is worried it could affect fitness and health of pupils if it school sports are hit .
teething problems mr miles said : " because children will lose out on the disicpline of turning up for coaching sessions and games they will find something else to do - play on the computer or worse " .
however , the teaching union nasuwt in wales believes any difficulties are purely " teething problems " and the benefits to teachers far outweigh any disadvantages .
" the answer at the end of the day is in the hands of the individual headmasters , " said geraint davies , union secretary in wales .
additional £ 70m " there are a number of options open to them so that they can release teachers .
" this is a statutory requirement and it has undoubtebly improved the lives of teachers . "
the welsh assembly government said it was providing an additional £ 70m by next year to support the changes .
" there is nothing in the workload agreement which says that school need to change their timetables to exclude sporting activities , " said a spokesman .
" we know of schools in wales where there has been significant progress in implementing the agreement .
" they have broadened the range of experiences and learning available to their pupils within the school day , whilst meeting the requirement of the agreement " .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- trade wars : your views bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 29 september 2005 , 09:00 gmt 10:00 uk trade wars : your views can international trade ever be free and fair ?
eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .
have you been affected by trade disputes ?
can there ever be free and fair trade in the global market place ?
how should the west react to the world 's fastest growing economies ?
can there be a global agreement on trade ?
we discussed the issue of international trade on our global interactive programme talking point on sunday , 25th september .
click on the link to watch the programme .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : " the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas " firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .
the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas .
iran and north korea will stay defiant and upset the trade agreement not directly but there will always be in the minds of the negotiators .
the un oil ; for food argument deepen the hole further .
will mr annan stay as he was or is there a dent in his name ?
when you study the jobless that is still created by many firms even now , the gap will be bigger .
means and methods of trade are changing daily .
there will always be a gap between the haves and not haves .
firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria " we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives " alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .
some of the most powerful nations have seen their currency fall to new lows , which make their exports more desirable .
it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland " sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks " lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi " free trade is merely colonialism in disguise " prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk " cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust " shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford " true global trade at an individual level is coming " matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us " free trade should mean free trade " mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa " the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn " brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us " in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests " ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle " there are still markets riddled with protectionism " nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak " i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair " aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india " fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws " adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada " trade disputes are going to continue forever " keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada " a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens " mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa " we have free trade in industrial goods and services " professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .
have you been affected by trade disputes ?
can there ever be free and fair trade in the global market place ?
how should the west react to the world 's fastest growing economies ?

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .
the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas .
iran and north korea will stay defiant and upset the trade agreement not directly but there will always be in the minds of the negotiators .
the un oil ; for food argument deepen the hole further .
will mr annan stay as he was or is there a dent in his name ?
when you study the jobless that is still created by many firms even now , the gap will be bigger .
means and methods of trade are changing daily .
there will always be a gap between the haves and not haves .
firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .
some of the most powerful nations have seen their currency fall to new lows , which make their exports more desirable .
it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .

over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .

over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .

over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .

it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .
some of the most powerful nations have seen their currency fall to new lows , which make their exports more desirable .
it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .
the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas .

the un oil ; for food argument deepen the hole further .
will mr annan stay as he was or is there a dent in his name ?
when you study the jobless that is still created by many firms even now , the gap will be bigger .
means and methods of trade are changing daily .
there will always be a gap between the haves and not haves .
firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .
some of the most powerful nations have seen their currency fall to new lows , which make their exports more desirable .
it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .
some of the most powerful nations have seen their currency fall to new lows , which make their exports more desirable .
it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .

paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .
the only agreement is that tomorrow will be different than today .
colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .
countries attempt to protect their native products by limiting -lrb- taxing -rrb- imports .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

eu and us trade officials are meeting to renew efforts to resolve their differences , deepening a crisis in global free trade talks .
the us and europe 's failure to reach agreement on agriculture is the main sticking point that has delayed a new worldwide trade deal ; the aim is to deliver a new global agreement on free trade by 2006 .
recent trade disputes between the eu , the us and china over textiles have highlighted the difficulties of enforcing global trade rules .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the trade war will continue as germany has an election that has created a split in many trade areas firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam the world will remain in barter using the strong currency that people trust .

firozali a mulla , dar-es-salaam free trade in australia is slowly being implemented .
there is a great deal of hardship , but there is also a safety net .
over the past 15 years australia and new zealand have advanced financially but regressed socially .
it seems like every time there is good news on the financial side , it only benefits the rich .
bill anderson , perth , australia ' free trade ' means lowering your costs to that of the emerging nations .
the problem for the west is they have high social costs .
now if we were to eliminate the nhs , welfare benefits , pensions , social housing , free education then yes by all means lets all compete on a level playing field .
john , france the principle of free trade is the same as the principle of communism .
in theory it sounds great , but can never work effectively in practice .
global trading rules would rely on all countries having the same level of economy and consumer needs , something that hopefully will never happen or the world will have become very bland .
roger cope , burton upon trent , england genuine individual freedom is not possible without genuine free trade .
when ordinary people have to seek permission from authorities to trade and when they have to see 75 % of the wealth they create confiscated -lrb- through the cumulative effects of taxation -rrb- they are effectively economic slaves who get to change their tyrants through a voting system .
the global group think acceptance of taxation and regulation will hamper the evolution of real democracy until it becomes discredited in the minds of the majority of people .
paul joseph , kingston , jamaica i doubt very much whether there is any thing in the spare of human activity today that is free and fair considering the way and manner each country is sticking to their guns and national interests .
ibrahim tudu , gusau , zamfara state , nigeria we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives alex , switzerland free trade is a fallacy !
even the biggest proponent of free trade , the us , only favours deals that advantage their own industry and usually to the detriment of some foreign countries local industry .
in fact , in the ' free trade ' free for all , there will be an amazing amount of immeasurable hardship in both industrialized and non industrialized countries as at the lowest and least measurable level of everyone 's economies we will witness an extinction of independent small and medium size businesses .
we will all suffer at the hands of a global elite that will control every facet of our lives .
from media to water to food stuffs .
i can not see how we will collectively benefit from this .
alex , switzerland the " levelled playing field " exists only in theory and to argue otherwise is to mislead people .
the first world north holds much influence , and arguably , heavily dictates of world trade rounds .
while they are quick to accuse and cry foul over developing countries over piracy , predatory prices and dumping to name a few , they are as equally guilty of subsidizing their agro exports and using sanitary and a range of unfair sanitary , packaging , and labelling rules , as unfair trade barriers to prevent imports from china , brazil , mexico and the lot of the underdeveloped south .
unless genuine efforts from eu and us are seen , by what right do they have to lobby for a " free " and " fair " trade .
lucio b pitlo iii , quezon city , philippines each nation wants to have any trade deal to its advantage .

it is a complex equation .
there are college educated bean counters who can not agree on what works and how the game of international finance and trade should be played .

colin , milton , usa free trade , if it means unrestricted trade across any international borders , is going to do more damage than good .
the area i live in is based on farming and manufacturing , and many of my friends live on farms .
by ending these subsidies , i would see many of my friends ' farms close , and tens of thousands of acres of land sent useless .
trade barriers and subsidies are essential to help my area stay prosperous .
andrew reed , lancaster , pa , usa i always find it funny that people are so quick to blame china for trade imbalances and loss of manufacturing jobs here in the states .
the truth is in the last ten years china itself has less manufacturing jobs because they have used technology to make production more efficient .
more us workers are displaced by states competing for companies to relocate to their area than outsourcing or off-shoring .
besides , when the goods at walmart are cheaper we all have more in our pocket to spend perhaps on something we still make here .
ken , los angeles , ca , usa the definition of ' free trade ' to western nations is ' it costs us nothing ' .
if true free trade were to happen and goods were bought and sold at their actual cost of manufacturing , unemployment levels in the west would rise ten fold at least .
no government is going to let that happen .
david , livingston , scotland sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks lloyd evans , brighton , uk free trade and fair trade are not the same thing , because the system has been rigged from day one by the ostensibly impartial bodies such as the world bank , imf and wto .
these organisations exist to further enrich western corporations to the detriment of everybody else - it 's no good pretending otherwise .
globalisation is much the same - the only winners are multinational corporations who take advantage of cheap labour wherever it can be found .
all is not lost however , because global " trade " is only possible while the fuel cost for transportation of goods is cheap .
sooner or later , escalating fuel costs will stop globalisation in its tracks , and the suffering it is causing will come to an end .
lloyd evans , brighton , uk the west 's massive agricultural subsidies need to be addressed if developing countries are to open their economies more .
also , more can be achieved in helping poor and developing countries by lowering trade barriers rather than giving them aid .
true empowerment of the poor comes from increasing work opportunities there ... but this can only come from lifting trade barriers .
deepak lalwani , london , uk trade wars - the worker has suffered most because worker rights and benefits are not adequately considered in the trade treaties .
if workers in country ' a ' are paid 50 cents per hour , how can a worker who is living in country ' b ' , receiving a much higher wage -lrb- but average for their needs in their home country -rrb- compete .
what ends up happening is that country ' a ' gets rich at the expense of its and country ' b 's ' workers .
rick loeffler , waukesha , wi free trade is merely colonialism in disguise prashant , toronto , canada free trade is merely colonialism in disguise .
the british economy destroyed the traditional agricultural framework of their colonies by introducing cash crops such as indigo .
institutions like the imf and world bank are doing the same thing by bullying third world economies into falling into line with the culture of conspicuous consumption .
prashant , toronto , canada free trade is an unattainable chimera .
economic theory which justifies it on the basis that lower costs benefit the consumer tends to obviate that many consumers lose their jobs and thus their income .
the welfare costs , paid by taxes out of the consumer 's pockets , grow and are not computed as part of the price of the so called cheaper products .
many products do not become cheaper by being manufactured in underdeveloped countries but allow for enormous margins which are spent in unnecessary publicity and sponsorship -lrb- eg athletic shoes and clothes multimillion deals with sportsmen or sportswomen -rrb- .
enrique puricelli , montevideo , uruguay planned economies do not work .
the old communist block was a good example .
like it or not , most deprivation is caused by corruption , political violence and high birth rates .
the incidences where trade barriers are the long term primary cause are relatively few and can be addressed .
david , stratford-upon-avon , uk fair trade , like a progressive tax system , should put a greater burden on the rich .
i think that poorer countries should be allowed to protect new industries with higher tariffs .
robin edwards , melbourne , australia if europe can not be trusted to honour the agreements they made 10 years ago with china then i would n't blame the chinese from finding ' alternative ' ways to get their goods into europe .
what people do n't seem to realise is that many of the goods coming from china are made in factories funded by european investors , using , in many cases , high tech equipment imported from europe and having order books full from european buyers .
this is another example of bloated european parliament unable to stick to its decision because there are too many members with self-interest in trade restrictions .
i used to be pro-european but this is yet another reason why i have become very anti .
all countries should be free to make their own trading policies .
arthur , derby uk cooperation is necessary but must be preceded by trust shane , usa free trade will mean abandoning some national industries and depending on other nations .
the us can not beat chinese prices on basic industrial items , nor can china compete with us technology .
cooperation is necessary , but must be preceded by trust -lrb- in the form of transparency -rrb- and political stability .
shane , usa forget it , it can not add up .
for centuries , the west has prospered because of trade imbalances and unfair advantages when it decides to open up to the poorer nations .
only when the developing world partners with each other will it assume some higher advantages and bargaining powers .
david mugabe alele , kampala , uganda all this talk of free and fair trade is a joke .
free and fair trade for who ?
so that the ultra-capitalist can gain access to more markets to cause massive retrenchments and make the poor poorer ?
i do not believe in too much protectionism but if free trade means more poverty for the poor , then protectionism is worthwhile .
atsu agbemabiase , accra , ghana rich countries are trying to protect their advantages and privileges at the expense of millions of poor farmers who could benefit from fairer trade .
amy barry , oxford true global trade at an individual level is coming matt munro , bristol , uk at the click of a mouse i can order a watch from hong kong , a suit from italy and an ipod from the us .
technology is already loosening the grip of national regulation and middle merchants .
true global trade at an individual level is coming and ca n't be slowed by politicians or middle men .
time they accepted this rather then trying to fight it .
matt munro , bristol , uk i think this trade imbalance will deepen into further socio-economic strains between the wealthier and poor economies .
once emerging powers like china , brazil , india begin to flex their political , economic clout they will team up with wealthier countries and finally the poor african nations will suffer from rest of world .
paithankar karthik , leipzig , germany the concept of free trade is intended to open up the global market for the big multinational corporations of the developed world .
they uphold these norms as long as their interests are served .
as soon as the emerging economic powers like china and india challenge their monopoly , they do everything in their powers to protect their interests by means of economic sanctions , protectionism and in extreme circumstances even going to war !
in essence , free trade means enrichment of the already rich and ruin the economies of nations who are already very poor !
srinivasan toft , denmark i 'm afraid trade wars are an inevitable reaction to the uneven pace of trade liberalisation .
bush 's recent announcement at the un was n't really all that helpful .
firstly , it was conditional .
the us will eliminate all tariffs if other countries do so too .
even if the us were to " lead the way " , in trade liberalisation , surely it 'd only apply to trade with the us .
we 'd feel we were getting cheated by the system , erect tariffs and we 're back at square one .
i do n't support it .
p. bolton , us free trade should mean free trade mark , nottingham , great britain we are supposed to be part of a global economy - free trade should mean free trade .
the damage to uk industry happened a long time ago .
we need to see how we can compete in the global marketplace rather than try to place restrictions on others .
mark , nottingham , great britain america can not sustain its high standard of living without somebody else in the world paying for it .
it 's a basic economic fact : the us can not compete fairly with countries like china because the costs and scale are in china 's favour .
not surprisingly , us presidents try to ensure that the us standard of living does n't slip under their watch , so they try every trick in the trade book to protect and subsidise us industry and agriculture , etc from having to face the rigours of true free trade .
global internet shopping and mail-order sales can circumvent government attempts to control trade .
eventually , the governments will lose control of trade altogether and have to accept that market forces will reign .
john farmer , henley-on-thames , uk i do n't see how there can be a real ' global agreement on trade ' .
we would continue having the kind of lop-sided agreements that favours only america and europe and not developing countries , especially in africa .
in a globalised world - are we not to concentrate on areas where we have comparative advantage ?
perhaps the only area is agriculture and that is where the developed world continue to subsidise its farmers .
ibrahim abu , abuja , nigeria genuinely free trade would give the third world the opportunity to escape poverty in a sustainable fashion without relying on patronising and often ineffective handouts .
if only our political leaders had the courage to take on vested industrial interests .
alex , london , uk the us and eu have separate tax structures and import quotas for different countries even when in some cases they could get a product of better quality in less price .
these standards are often based on political climate and trade benefits overlooked .
i do n't blame them but then they should not champion globalization , open markets and free trade .
qureshi , boston , ma , usa canada would n't be nearly as prosperous if we were n't a part of nafta .
96 % of all trade flows without a hitch north and south across our border .
80 % of all our exports go to the us and 40 % of our gdp is from trade with the us .
whiney canadians just do n't realize how good they have it and do n't expend any great effort to find new markets for our products .
janet , edmonton , canada trade will always be lop-sided as countries are in different stages of development .
the two fastest emerging economies of china and india are excellent examples .
recently china was accused of massive dumping .
fortunately this did not escalate into a full-blown trade war .
so while agreements are reached , it is still doubtful whether a global -lrb- workable and practical -rrb- agreement on trade can be reached .
the jury is still out on this .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium true free trade simply can not happen without massive job losses in the west .
africa can produce virtually everything cheaper and at a higher quality than the eu or the us but is priced out of the market due to trade tariffs , yet it is these tariffs that protect domestic jobs .
at the end of the day , you have to make a choice .
come out in support of big business and shareholders or everyday people .
the imf , world bank , etc are there to make rich people richer .
the peoples co-op 's running in argentina are showing us how to do things .
throw out the rich owners , let the workers run the factories and share the profits at a local level to improve local communities .
globalisation is wrong and at every attempt in the past has ended with massive wars as it collapses .
vish , uk i 'd like to make a comment to the many people on here accusing the us of unfair trade practices .
i know we give large subsidies to farmers , which i do n't agree with personally , but in all other respects , we have been very fair by opening our borders .
and while i agree that some asian nations are very open to trade , all of them cheat in other ways by interfering in the currency markets to make their exports cheaper and their imports from the us more expensive .
that amounts to an indirect subsidy on all their exports and defacto tariffs on all their imports .
so , will free trade ever be fair ? - nope .
if it ever does , look out for cheating in other areas , like currency markets .
sv , new york , usa the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn brian , canada the us and other western countries have been using the imf and world bank as a tool to badger poorer countries into submission .
while subsidizing their own farmers and producers in meeting competitive prices , the borrowing third world nations are being told what to grow or else their loans will be withdrawn .
this type of trade is neither " free " nor " fair " .
brian , canada true free trade would bankrupt most western countries in under 12 months .
nathan hobbs , luton , uk to milic , usa , it is not possible to implement a free trade scheme " in which almost everyone benefits " .
free trade always causes displaced workers regardless of how many new jobs are created elsewhere .
in the long run the majority benefits , but in the short run there are many local casualties .
this is hardly " fair " from their perspective .
michael , calif , usa where is this ' capitalist free market ' everyone keeps talking about -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- ?
all i see are third world countries being flooded with eu / us produce that was heavily subsidised by the government .
how can supposedly capitalist nations demand that other nations open up for trade when this is going on ?
franchesca mullin , belfast , ni nafta was a huge disaster for america 's workers .
canada gets to sell her products , mexico gets tons of jobs and unfettered traffic across our southern border and the american working class gets the shaft .
it may sound fair to reduce poverty in poor nations , but who 's worried about the rising poverty in rich nations ?
paula , boston , us in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests ibrahim , london , england fair trade is a classic " prisoner 's dilemma " .
it can bring the best benefits only if all sides cooperate and play fairly .
but there is always the temptation for nations to cheat and grab an advantage .
in the end , man 's greed leads to each nation looking after its own interests even at the expense of someone else .
ibrahim , london , england canadians , more than anyone , know what " free trade " with the us is really like .
one needs just to look at the endless appeals to the wto rulings against the us in the softwood lumber dispute to realise that if the us does n't come out on top of a deal , they will find a way to circumvent it .
i would urge all countries to be very careful in what they wish for - they may just get it .
m. france , kelowna , canada political stability is the greatest of all free trade , and there are huge markets waiting to be tapped .
we need to promote manufacturing investment in africa to balance out world trade .
it 's a fact the manufacturing will be where the cheapest labour costs are .
martin parkes , hemel hempstead , england western europe and the us have developed a social model based on unsustainable levels of personal consumption , which is in turn based on unfair economic advantages - originally , colonial exploitation , and now the management of a rigged system of trade rules .
the coming wto ministerial in hong kong , in december , has got to address the export subsidies that rich countries give to their products -lrb- such as cotton -rrb- as well as market access for poor countries -lrb- who currently pay little tax on exports of raw materials such as cocoa beans but pay hugely on finished products such as chocolate -rrb- .
it 's not a question of " can there be a global agreement on trade ? " - there has to be a global rebalancing of international trade rules to help poor countries do better .
neil alldred , belfast , northern ireland there is a very big difference between fair trade and sustainable trade .
fair trade merely has to be honest : the seller must own the goods and the buyer must pay the agreed price , however high or low it might be .
if however , the buyer strikes too hard a bargain , next time he or she wishes to purchase the same goods or services , the seller will not be around to sell them .
this is unsustainable and in a truly free market it would stop .
michael lakey , newcastle there are still markets riddled with protectionism nathan james , durham , uk we currently do not have free trade , contrary to what a lot of groups say .
there are still markets riddled with protectionism , and under a system of protectionism , the most powerful trading nations will in effect state the terms and conditions of trade .
this is what has been going on for over 50 years and africa has been suffering partly because of this .
nathan james , durham , uk how can free and fair trade be achieved when the primary motive of trans-nationals in profit maximization at all cost ?
what is feasible is minimizing the " uneven playing field " in global trade , which , " all other things being equal " , will contribute in reducing poverty in poverty-stricken countries .
sigismond wilson , sierra leonean in michigan usa international trade can never be free especially in the system of states .
it is because the capitalist system , which needs competition , accumulation , and free markets is in contrast with the states system that depends on national security , national interest , and sovereignty .
however , there is possibility of fair trade with the support of and alliance among grassroots communities around the world .
yin min kyi , usa no , because individual countries will always have a protectionist attitude when it comes to jobs .
nafta is a good example .
christopher southerlin , anchorage , ak i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair aviral sanghera , bangalore , india i do n't think world trade can ever be free and fair .
if it does then us ad europe stand to lose out to low production cost economies in east europe and asia which they will never allow to happen .
aviral sanghera , bangalore , india what free trade ?
all i see are double standards and hypocrisy coming from the eu and us .
so far , all trade between the developed and developing countries go along the lines of " open your -lrb- developing country -rrb- markets to our -lrb- developed country -rrb- products .
we will then decide which of your products you can sell to us , if at all . "
jun , new york , usa i am not opposed to free and fair trade , the problem is it could take years if not decades to accomplish a level of trade in which almost everyone benefits .
in the mean time , their are high " adjustment costs " for transitioning to a free market .
this is the issue governments and people must grapple with in the changing world .
many people in the us and europe spend an enormous amount of time and money on their education when preparing for a specific career .
they may also spend years on the job developing their career or specialized skill and to just watch the opportunity be shipped overnight to low cost china would be daunting for just about anyone .
milic , us there is no doubt that the international trade is becoming increasingly fair and transparent .
the kind of trade barriers which existed just a short few years ago is unthinkable now .
for instance it was not long ago japanese tried to exclude the import of french skis on the pretext that the japanese snow was different , till the french responded to exclude japanese motorcycles on the ground that the french roads were different !
it is difficult to visualize the incident of this kind now .
in my own country india , the market is full of international brands which were unimaginable just a few years back .
n.g. krishnan , bangalore , india fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws adrian leishman , jacksonville , fl usa fair trade must be balanced with equal labour laws .
an employee in the united states costs an employer almost twice his or her salary when benefits , insurance and other government mandated fees are applied .
a worker in the us can not legally be paid a low enough wage to compete with developing nations .
adrian leishman , jacksonville , usa there is no free trade , just as there is no free lunch .
access to markets , as well as access to cheap labour carries a price .
continuing to pretend that there is an unfettered reality behind the words " free trade " just makes more and more millions of people world-wide distrust the politicians and businessmen who use the term .
joe , santa fe , usa i have numerous friends who have lost their jobs because the jobs were " exported . "
if you lose your job because it was " exported " overseas , is that " fair ? "
some say it is , but they are not the ones declared redundant .
the 5 euro a day worker in asia that " imported " the job thinks it fair because he is now employed .
a government 's main responsibility is to its own workers first , not distant strangers .
michael , calif , usa the worst thing canada ever did was sign on to the north american free trade agreement .
nafta was supposed to open up the canada-us border to fair trade , however the us has a very one-sided opinion regarding what is " fair " .
the minute us industries start complaining , all the rules go out the window and canada ends up the loser .
global and free trade benefits the major powers at the expense of other nations .
danny , canada trade disputes are going to continue forever keith , us / uk trade disputes are going to continue forever .
there will always be the new entrant to the market thought to be trading unfairly either dumping goods , receiving subsidies or not paying high enough wages .
i do n't think the playing field can be levelled .
but a question always arises - does the consumer always get the benefit of the cheap products or is it more a case of the distributor cashing in ?
keith , us / uk international trade has benefited the world for the most part .
granted there are still inadequacies .
however , numerous nations have been able to develop because of opened borders .
yet , we still have to remember that the rapid globalization we 're currently experiencing is a relatively new concept that -lrb- just like anything else -rrb- requires time to develop efficiency .
once the governments stop interfering with the natural course of supply and demand , the world will see the benefits more clearly .
greg , denver , co , usa fair trade is a fallacy .
the word " fair " itself implies equality .
companies in the us are all for using lcc -lrb- low cost countries -rrb- to move manufacturing to .
the labour is cheap ; labour laws and benefits non-existent , and the environmental laws are lax .
this all comes because of trade associations like the wto who have no plan as to how to make the trading fair for both buyer and seller nations .
while the companies and wto say they are bringing jobs to the poor , what these companies are really doing is lining their pockets .
anon the big guns will never allow the smaller countries to compete on the same scale .
they will demand ' competitive ' -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- prices and the world will continue this way until major governments realise that this type of manipulation is n't fair .
why should a farmer in africa get terribly low prices for his crops so that i in the west can save a few more cents and some ceo can have a new car ?
until modern day trade rules are completely revamped , the global market will continue to be run like this , in essence , capitalism at its worst .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland food is one of those commodities that a nation should not become dependent upon others to produce .
i 'm in favor of keeping subsidies in place .
many assume that reducing subsidies will encourage production in lesser developed nations .
i , for one , am not willing to participate in a social experiment to see if this belief is valid .
the consequences could bring poverty to all corners of the globe .
rob g. , kansas city , usa all the western power will do whatever they can to stay superior to the third-world countries , including setting new rules , bending old rules , or just ignoring all rules .
john , illinois , us when you have countries like america who ignore every ruling in regards to trade issues with canada by both nafta and the wto , what is the point of free trade anyway ?
paul girling , toronto , canada a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens mark , usa a nation 's first obligation is the interests of its own citizens .
generosity only goes so far and governments have to weigh the impact any agreements or changes in policy will have at home .
in democratic countries , they also have to weigh the political impact .
these are surely difficult choices deciding whose farmers or workers suffer at the expense of others .
right now in the area of agribusiness , it is apparent that neither europe nor the us are prepared to make further sacrifices .
mark , usa free trade would mean prices , and wages would be comparable across the world .
this would n't happen only by an increase in the wages in poorer countries , but also by decrease in wages -lrb- or / and loss of jobs -rrb- in richer countries for people whose jobs can be done cheaper elsewhere .
politically this would not be acceptable in rich countries , and no lobby could be effective for this .
outsourcing is more likely with the cushier jobs remaining in rich countries , and lower paying jobs being farmed out .
after all , which ceo would replace him / herself to cut costs ?
kpdodo , mauritius international trade will never be free and fair .
labour costs differ across the globe , so governments slap on duties .
governments subsidise overproducing farmers , and then dump the excess on developing nations swamping the small market with products and putting local producers out of business .
human nature revolves around greed , we will always try to make more .
dw , chicago usa -lrb- brit expat -rrb- the eu shows what can be accomplished when people agree to live by a common set of fair rules .
what appears to me to prevent this happening worldwide is the refusal of some to protect workers , consumers , and the environment in less developed areas , so as to keep prices down and profits up in the rich nations .
matt , riverside , ca , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa we have free trade in industrial goods and services .
agricultural goods and labor markets need to have free trade too .
agriculture and labor exports are critical for eliminating poverty in india and sub-saharan african countries .
there is a need for some common environmental standards worldwide .
professor arun khanna , indianapolis , usa international trade seems to be no different from international politics - the rich and developed countries will always be the ones who benefit .
america is a classic example of expounding " free trade " but will be the first to breach any agreement when things do n't go their way .
at the end of the day , all agreements are " much ado about nothing " .
husni , kuala lumpur we must have rules and they must bring everyone onto a level playing field .
in china the workers get nothing close to what they get in the u.s and europe .
there must be incentives to improve the lives of the people and then trade with china and india will be similar to the us and eu .
just bickering over stuff and eventually both sides give a little .
todd , virginia , usa fair trade is a chimera .
the whole purpose of the european union is to create a favourable trade zone for member states and to create collective trading power for a wealthy handful of nations .
this has always been true of the united states too .
mandelson 's comments on liberalising farm trade , which rather flies in the face of tony blair 's insistence that the eu cuts subsidies -lrb- but we 're used to inconsistency from labour -rrb- , is a typically cynical remark from the master of spin : it is not subsidies that keeps chinese goods free , but lower wages , more efficient production , less red tape and less irresponsible taxation and public spending that really gives asia the edge .

paul knightley of the tornado and storm research organisation had predicted the storms which hit aghalee and rasharkin on wednesday afternoon .
" northern ireland gets four or five such events a year , possibly more , " he said .
mr knightley said judging by reports , it seemed to have been a tornado .
locals in rasharkin described winds which blew down trees and damaged farm buildings in rasharkin as a " mini-tornado " .
however , mr knightley said meteorologists were not too fond of this term .
they 're not particularly common , but they 're not uncommon either paul knightley tornado expert " quite often people say ' mini-tornado ' when in fact it is a tornado .
all tornadoes are tornadoes , if you like , " he said .
mr knightley said wednesday 's high winds did not just come out of the blue .
" we had a very strong cold front heading in from the west , " he said .
" as it pushed its way across the province through the day , it was shoving up the warmer air ahead of it very violently .
" there was also a lot of wind chill in the atmosphere , which basically allows any air that 's ascending to start rotating . "
mr knightley is sure that the tornado had nothing to do with global warming .
a family recently moved out of this mobile home " every time we get some strong winds or strange weather event , people start asking if it 's climate change .
" tornadoes have been occurring in the uk since the year dot .
they 're not particularly common , but they 're not uncommon either . "
he said the science behind tornadoes is still not fully understood and forecasting methods remained " fairly crude " .
" all you can say is something like an area the size of ireland has a chance of a tornado within the next four to six hours , " he said .
" at the moment , that 's as accurate as we can get .
" these things are so small that just one or two villages get hit , and trying to predict something as local as that in the grand scheme of the weather is very tricky . "
