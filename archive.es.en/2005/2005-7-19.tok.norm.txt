the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "

previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .

" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "

" the smell is something very special and scarce nowadays , " thorsten jahn , whose cans of " trabi " exhaust sell online for 3.98 euros -lrb- $ 4.81 -rrb- , told the reuters news agency .
" i wanted to preserve the past in an original way . " fifteen years after reunification , nostalgia for east germany has been running strong as fond memories of the communist state 's social safety net , holiday camps and quaint consumer products like the tiny , plasticky trabants increasingly eclipse the negative aspects of the oppressive authoritarian state . as fewer trabis ply the streets of unified germany in favor of vws , mercedes and bmws , the canned fumes appear to be just the ticket for those germans yearning for the socialist motoring days gone by .
a friend of jahn produced 1,800 cans in four days by holding pieces of cotton wool into the exhaust pipe of his trabi .
jahn said that inhaling the scent would pose no danger as the cotton wool filtered out toxic particles . people in the former german democratic republic usually had to wait for years for the delivery of a trabant .
many that remain on the road are often customized with bigger engines , convertible roofs and eye-catching paintwork . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 . " after a careful assessment of the results of our investigations so far , the suspicion that payments were made has been confirmed , " the prosecutor said in a statement , according to reuters . andreas von zitzwewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the chipmaker 's most valuable managers , resigned over the weekend following allegations that he had taken up to 259,000 euros in kickbacks for arranging motor sports sponsorship deals -lrb- like the infineon raceway , above , in california -rrb- with a swiss pr firm . a former colleague of his , harald eggers , is under investigation for accepting up to 50,000 euros .

" the smell is something very special and scarce nowadays , " thorsten jahn , whose cans of " trabi " exhaust sell online for 3.98 euros -lrb- $ 4.81 -rrb- , told the reuters news agency .
" i wanted to preserve the past in an original way . " fifteen years after reunification , nostalgia for east germany has been running strong as fond memories of the communist state 's social safety net , holiday camps and quaint consumer products like the tiny , plasticky trabants increasingly eclipse the negative aspects of the oppressive authoritarian state . as fewer trabis ply the streets of unified germany in favor of vws , mercedes and bmws , the canned fumes appear to be just the ticket for those germans yearning for the socialist motoring days gone by .
a friend of jahn produced 1,800 cans in four days by holding pieces of cotton wool into the exhaust pipe of his trabi .
jahn said that inhaling the scent would pose no danger as the cotton wool filtered out toxic particles . people in the former german democratic republic usually had to wait for years for the delivery of a trabant .

the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 . " after a careful assessment of the results of our investigations so far , the suspicion that payments were made has been confirmed , " the prosecutor said in a statement , according to reuters . andreas von zitzwewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the chipmaker 's most valuable managers , resigned over the weekend following allegations that he had taken up to 259,000 euros in kickbacks for arranging motor sports sponsorship deals -lrb- like the infineon raceway , above , in california -rrb- with a swiss pr firm . a former colleague of his , harald eggers , is under investigation for accepting up to 50,000 euros .

the corporate scandal is the second one to rock germany following revelations of staff improprieties carmaker volkswagen that led to the resignation of personnel chief peter hartz . infineon managers , specifically chairman of the board max dietrich kley and former chairman ulrich schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , apparently knew about the affair as early as april 2004 , when udo schneider , the chief of the swiss pr firm bf consulting , informed schumacher about the payments to von zitzewitz and eggers .
schneider now denies he ever did that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich schumacher left infineon at the beginning of the year berlin 's tagesspiegel , relying on confidential sources , reported tuesday that kley held off conducting an investigation because he needed von zitzewitz , the head of infineon 's core memory-chip unit , to help him oust schumacher .
on monday , kley said that he launched an internal investigation into the kickbacks that came up empty . a valuable asset " as long as there was no proof of the accuracy of the allegations against dr. von zitzewitz … the supervisory board could only decide in favor of the accused , " kley told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . infineon stock has taken a dive as a result of revelations .
shares closed down 1.2 percent at 8.31 euros on the blue-chip dax index yesterday . " i 'm very concerned , " uche orije , a semiconductors analyst at jp morgan told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2005 german banks lose state backing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darkness falls on the german banking sector 's days in the sun the world is now a much tougher place for germany 's regional state banks , or " landesbanken , " as their state guarantees expired at midnight on monday . following long battles with the european commission , germany 's 11 public-sector regional state banks lost their state guarantees at midnight on monday , a privilege that enabled them to refinance themselves via the capital markets at very favorable conditions and pass on the cheaper borrowing costs to their customers . the state guarantees - which mean that if a landesbank were to go bust , the regional state government -lrb- that is to say , the taxpayer -rrb- would be left to pick up the tab - were long seen as a red rag to a bull for the banks ' private rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , it was private-sector banks such as deutsche bank , hypovereinsbank and commerzbank that started the ball rolling by lodging a complaint with the european union executive arm in brussels in 1999 against what they saw as the unfair advantages enjoyed by state-owned rivals such as westlb and the public-sector " sparkassen " , or savings banks . the state guarantees enabled the landesbanken to enjoy top-notch credit ratings from rating agencies such as standard and poor 's or moody 's . slow process in 2001 , the eu commission ruled that the practice should be abolished .
but in order to give the landesbanken time to adapt , it was agreed that the state guarantees would only cease at midnight on july 18 , 2005 . furthermore , any debt issued prior to that date would continue to be backed by the state until 2015 .
so , while the playing field is indeed being levelled , the process is still happening only very slowly . nevertheless , the landesbanken now find themselves increasingly exposed to the fierce wind of competition , and not all of them may be able to survive in future , analysts believe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of the bavarian landesbank in munich as a result , some of the banks are already joining forces .
the landesbanken of baden-württemberg and of the rhineland-palatinate merged recently , as did the banks of kiel and hamburg .
frankfurt 's sparkasse is being taken over by the hessische landesbank and westlb and nordlb are also collaborating closely . " we need to attain a critical mass , " westlb chairman thomas fischer said recently . in fact , german chancellor gerhard schröder recently predicted that only three landesbanken could be left in the long run . rivals not satisfied despite the mini-revolution that the abolishment of the state guarantees constitutes , private-sector rivals are demanding even further changes to the german banking sector , which is divided strictly between the public sector , the private sector and cooperative banks . " in germany , the law allows public banks to buy private ones , but not vice versa .
it 's a one-way street .
that 's not fair , " complained manfred weber , head of the private banking federation bdb . however , the dam that divides the landesbanken from the private sector looks as if it might break soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regional state of north rhine-westphalia , a major shareholder of westlb , plans to sell its 25-percent stake in the bank to help replenish its public coffers .
and press reports suggest that private-sector rival commerzbank is in the running to buy the stake . furthermore , brussels is also pushing for the landesbanken to open themselves up to private investors . the eu commission has ruled that the landesbanken must repay around a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in public subsidies received during the 1990s . the banks have agreed to do so , but hope their public owners will immediately fill the gap by injecting fresh capital . however , eu competition commissioner nellie kroes insists that the reinvestment be substantially lower and private investors must also be involved . but so far , the landesbanken reject such suggestions and argue that brussels is not in a position to impose conditions . as long as the savings banks and regional state governments that owned the landesbanken financed the banks at market prices , the eu did not have the right to impose additional conditions .
the public sector owners should not be put at a disadvantage to private investors , the landesbanken argue . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks grapple with change the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- european banks leave germany in the dust german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .
german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that .

but in order to give the landesbanken time to adapt , it was agreed that the state guarantees would only cease at midnight on july 18 , 2005 . furthermore , any debt issued prior to that date would continue to be backed by the state until 2015 .
so , while the playing field is indeed being levelled , the process is still happening only very slowly . nevertheless , the landesbanken now find themselves increasingly exposed to the fierce wind of competition , and not all of them may be able to survive in future , analysts believe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headquarters of the bavarian landesbank in munich as a result , some of the banks are already joining forces .
the landesbanken of baden-württemberg and of the rhineland-palatinate merged recently , as did the banks of kiel and hamburg .
frankfurt 's sparkasse is being taken over by the hessische landesbank and westlb and nordlb are also collaborating closely . " we need to attain a critical mass , " westlb chairman thomas fischer said recently . in fact , german chancellor gerhard schröder recently predicted that only three landesbanken could be left in the long run . rivals not satisfied despite the mini-revolution that the abolishment of the state guarantees constitutes , private-sector rivals are demanding even further changes to the german banking sector , which is divided strictly between the public sector , the private sector and cooperative banks . " in germany , the law allows public banks to buy private ones , but not vice versa .
it 's a one-way street .
that 's not fair , " complained manfred weber , head of the private banking federation bdb . however , the dam that divides the landesbanken from the private sector looks as if it might break soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regional state of north rhine-westphalia , a major shareholder of westlb , plans to sell its 25-percent stake in the bank to help replenish its public coffers .
and press reports suggest that private-sector rival commerzbank is in the running to buy the stake . furthermore , brussels is also pushing for the landesbanken to open themselves up to private investors . the eu commission has ruled that the landesbanken must repay around a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- in public subsidies received during the 1990s . the banks have agreed to do so , but hope their public owners will immediately fill the gap by injecting fresh capital . however , eu competition commissioner nellie kroes insists that the reinvestment be substantially lower and private investors must also be involved . but so far , the landesbanken reject such suggestions and argue that brussels is not in a position to impose conditions . as long as the savings banks and regional state governments that owned the landesbanken financed the banks at market prices , the eu did not have the right to impose additional conditions .
the public sector owners should not be put at a disadvantage to private investors , the landesbanken argue . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks grapple with change the recent takeover of germany 's hypovereinsbank by italy 's unicredito has led to speculation about further mergers and sales .
experts believe it could lead to more consolidation in the german banking landscape .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that .

the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "

or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .

bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "

the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .

he said that the ruling must be closely reviewed and also stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation must be passed within the boundaries of the constitution and that should n't be weakened .

bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .

the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .

" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "

" the smell is something very special and scarce nowadays , " thorsten jahn , whose cans of " trabi " exhaust sell online for 3.98 euros -lrb- $ 4.81 -rrb- , told the reuters news agency .
" i wanted to preserve the past in an original way . " fifteen years after reunification , nostalgia for east germany has been running strong as fond memories of the communist state 's social safety net , holiday camps and quaint consumer products like the tiny , plasticky trabants increasingly eclipse the negative aspects of the oppressive authoritarian state . as fewer trabis ply the streets of unified germany in favor of vws , mercedes and bmws , the canned fumes appear to be just the ticket for those germans yearning for the socialist motoring days gone by .
a friend of jahn produced 1,800 cans in four days by holding pieces of cotton wool into the exhaust pipe of his trabi .
jahn said that inhaling the scent would pose no danger as the cotton wool filtered out toxic particles . people in the former german democratic republic usually had to wait for years for the delivery of a trabant .
many that remain on the road are often customized with bigger engines , convertible roofs and eye-catching paintwork . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

on monday , kley said that he launched an internal investigation into the kickbacks that came up empty . a valuable asset " as long as there was no proof of the accuracy of the allegations against dr. von zitzewitz … the supervisory board could only decide in favor of the accused , " kley told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . infineon stock has taken a dive as a result of revelations .
shares closed down 1.2 percent at 8.31 euros on the blue-chip dax index yesterday . " i 'm very concerned , " uche orije , a semiconductors analyst at jp morgan told reuters .
" we have very high regard for mr. von zitzewitz .
this is someone who 's been quite central in putting infineon on the map in terms of technology . " von zitzwitz had been with the company since 1988 , when it was still a part of siemens ag .
since being promoted to upper management in 1999 , he has headed the company 's manufacturing strategy and its fight to dethrone leading chipmaker samsung electronics . employees disappointed , not surprised former infineon manager eggers , now the interim chief executive of swiss technology group unaxis after resigning from the company last year , has not commented on the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers said they are disappointed , not surprised by the revelations . representatives of infineon workers say they are disappointed , but not surprised by the revelations , given the recent scandals surrounding german managers . " it 's incomprehensible how people who make a lot of money anyway can let themselves be corrupted in such a way , " klaus luschtinetz , the head of the company 's employees committee , told the tagesspiegel . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de infineon manager resigns amid scandal a top manager at german semi-conductors giant infineon has offered to resign amid a prosecutor 's investigation into alleged corruption at europe 's second-largest computer chip maker , the company announced late saturday .

the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .
yet with possible september elections brewing , party colleagues do n't think there will be enough time to pass a new bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz -lrb- photo -rrb- is more skeptical .
" i ca n't imagine that we have a chance to pass it in this legislative period , " he said on german public radio .
he said that the ruling must be closely reviewed and also stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation must be passed within the boundaries of the constitution and that should n't be weakened .
greens politician hans-christian ströbele called the decision a box on the ears for both the parliament and the ruling government .
opposition happy over ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ruling politicians grumbled over the verdict , the opposition could n't keep its emotions from showing .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "
europe must now wait on a new law .
the european commission urged german politicians , be it those in the current coalition or possibly a new conservative government , to address the matter and pass a law that would make the eu arrest warrant valid in germany , and hence , give it some bite across the continent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 294 analysts and institutional investors , rose by 17.5 points to plus 37.0 points in july , the highest level since september 2004 , zew said in a statement .
the increase was much better than expected : analysts had been penciling in a more modest rise in the index to around 22 points this month .
" the reason for the sharp rise is the continued robustness of the global economy despite high oil prices , " zew president wolfgang franz said .
that and the weaker euro have led to a sharp rise in manufacturing orders in germany , he said .
" it remains to be seen whether this is a sustained upward correction to economic expectations , " franz continued .
" as before , weak domestic demand remains the achilles ' heel to a lasting economic recovery .
that will only change if the necessary reforms are implemented in the areas of corporate taxation , social welfare system and the labor markets . "
the zew indicator represents the balance between positive and negative expectations for the economy over the next six months .
if most analysts and institutional investors polled believe the economy will improve , the index shows a plus .
if most are expecting a deterioration , the index shows a minus . dw-world.de the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc german confidence spurts ahead in july a leading confidence index in germany published on tuesday picked up unexpected sharply this month as the fall of the euro and robust global growth helped offset concern about the effects of high oil prices .
the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , based on a poll of 294 analysts and institutional investors , rose by 17.5 points to plus 37.0 points in july , the highest level since september 2004 , zew said in a statement .
the increase was much better than expected : analysts had been penciling in a more modest rise in the index to around 22 points this month .
" the reason for the sharp rise is the continued robustness of the global economy despite high oil prices , " zew president wolfgang franz said .
that and the weaker euro have led to a sharp rise in manufacturing orders in germany , he said .
" it remains to be seen whether this is a sustained upward correction to economic expectations , " franz continued .
" as before , weak domestic demand remains the achilles ' heel to a lasting economic recovery .
that will only change if the necessary reforms are implemented in the areas of corporate taxation , social welfare system and the labor markets . "
the zew indicator represents the balance between positive and negative expectations for the economy over the next six months .
if most analysts and institutional investors polled believe the economy will improve , the index shows a plus .
if most are expecting a deterioration , the index shows a minus . dw-world.de the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

europe is trying to create a zone of freedom and security and " inside this zone , mutual confidence between authorities and the transfer of those responsible for serious criminal acts according to european arrest warrants is very important , " conde pumpido said .
the prosecutor also said he was in favor of handing over the dossier on darkazanli to the german authorities to follow up as the businessman may pose a danger to germany .
a spanish judge , fernando grande-marlaska , has been asked to give germany all the facts in spain 's case against darkazanli , according to a source in the prosecutor 's office .
spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al-qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002.spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said monday he respected the german court 's decision , but added : " we will find a way to resolve these legal difficulties . " dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2005 europe must wait for arrest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling of the constitutional court is being called a " setback " german politicians are split on a ruling by germany 's highest court that struck a blow to the eu arrest warrant .
the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .
yet with possible september elections brewing , party colleagues do n't think there will be enough time to pass a new bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz -lrb- photo -rrb- is more skeptical .
" i ca n't imagine that we have a chance to pass it in this legislative period , " he said on german public radio .
he said that the ruling must be closely reviewed and also stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation must be passed within the boundaries of the constitution and that should n't be weakened .
greens politician hans-christian ströbele called the decision a box on the ears for both the parliament and the ruling government .
opposition happy over ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ruling politicians grumbled over the verdict , the opposition could n't keep its emotions from showing .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "
europe must now wait on a new law .
the european commission urged german politicians , be it those in the current coalition or possibly a new conservative government , to address the matter and pass a law that would make the eu arrest warrant valid in germany , and hence , give it some bite across the continent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

the release " concerns us because we base the anti-terrorism fight on international cooperation , " candido conde-pumpido , spain 's attorney general , said on spanish national radio .
mamoun darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg monday after the german federal constitutional court ruled that handing him over to spain on a new european union arrest warrant would violate germany 's constitution .
europe is trying to create a zone of freedom and security and " inside this zone , mutual confidence between authorities and the transfer of those responsible for serious criminal acts according to european arrest warrants is very important , " conde pumpido said .
the prosecutor also said he was in favor of handing over the dossier on darkazanli to the german authorities to follow up as the businessman may pose a danger to germany .
a spanish judge , fernando grande-marlaska , has been asked to give germany all the facts in spain 's case against darkazanli , according to a source in the prosecutor 's office .
spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al-qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002.spanish justice minister juan fernando lopez aguilar said monday he respected the german court 's decision , but added : " we will find a way to resolve these legal difficulties .

the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 . " after a careful assessment of the results of our investigations so far , the suspicion that payments were made has been confirmed , " the prosecutor said in a statement , according to reuters . andreas von zitzwewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the chipmaker 's most valuable managers , resigned over the weekend following allegations that he had taken up to 259,000 euros in kickbacks for arranging motor sports sponsorship deals -lrb- like the infineon raceway , above , in california -rrb- with a swiss pr firm . a former colleague of his , harald eggers , is under investigation for accepting up to 50,000 euros .

the corporate scandal is the second one to rock germany following revelations of staff improprieties carmaker volkswagen that led to the resignation of personnel chief peter hartz . infineon managers , specifically chairman of the board max dietrich kley and former chairman ulrich schumacher -lrb- photo -rrb- , apparently knew about the affair as early as april 2004 , when udo schneider , the chief of the swiss pr firm bf consulting , informed schumacher about the payments to von zitzewitz and eggers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2005 europe must wait for arrest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling of the constitutional court is being called a " setback " german politicians are split on a ruling by germany 's highest court that struck a blow to the eu arrest warrant .
the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .
yet with possible september elections brewing , party colleagues do n't think there will be enough time to pass a new bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz -lrb- photo -rrb- is more skeptical .
" i ca n't imagine that we have a chance to pass it in this legislative period , " he said on german public radio .
he said that the ruling must be closely reviewed and also stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation must be passed within the boundaries of the constitution and that should n't be weakened .
greens politician hans-christian ströbele called the decision a box on the ears for both the parliament and the ruling government .
opposition happy over ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ruling politicians grumbled over the verdict , the opposition could n't keep its emotions from showing .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "
europe must now wait on a new law .
the european commission urged german politicians , be it those in the current coalition or possibly a new conservative government , to address the matter and pass a law that would make the eu arrest warrant valid in germany , and hence , give it some bite across the continent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

the justice minister wants revisions implemented before september , others see a threat to citizens ' rights . only hours after judges ruled in mamoun darkazanli 's favor , he dashed away in a taxi without comment .
the german-syrian had been wanted by spanish authorities for a possible connection to the al qaeda , in particular for links to the hamburg cell that led the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
german justice minister brigitte zypries was quick to speak , calling the court 's decision " another setback for the german government in the fight against terrorism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mamoun darkazanli and many others will walk free after karlsruhe ruling now was time for damage control after yet another blow against the schröder administration by german judges .
previous trials against suspected terrorists have ended with lower-court convictions being overturned and retried , as is currently the case with mounir el motassadeq .
or a not guilty ruling was handed down , as was the case with abdelghani mzoudi last october .
new legislation possible ?
zypries defended herself after the ruling was read .
she said it was impossible to know that the federal constitutional court would rule the whole law invalid .
she had expected karlsruhe to ask for revisions to the legislation that approved the eu arrest warrant .
that did n't happen and now action must be taken .
zypries has said she would like a revised law implemented in four to six weeks .
yet with possible september elections brewing , party colleagues do n't think there will be enough time to pass a new bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's domestic policy expert , dieter wiefelspütz -lrb- photo -rrb- is more skeptical .
" i ca n't imagine that we have a chance to pass it in this legislative period , " he said on german public radio .
he said that the ruling must be closely reviewed and also stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation must be passed within the boundaries of the constitution and that should n't be weakened .
greens politician hans-christian ströbele called the decision a box on the ears for both the parliament and the ruling government .
opposition happy over ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ruling politicians grumbled over the verdict , the opposition could n't keep its emotions from showing .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the ruling and said it was right that the karlsruhe-based court upheld a constitutional article that prevents the state from extraditing its citizens .
" i would n't want a german citizen to be extradited to a foreign country without him having had the chance of receiving a hearing in a german court , " he said .
former justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg only saw here doubts confirmed : " from the beginning i had my doubts about the implementation of the european arrest warrant in germany . "
europe must now wait on a new law .
the european commission urged german politicians , be it those in the current coalition or possibly a new conservative government , to address the matter and pass a law that would make the eu arrest warrant valid in germany , and hence , give it some bite across the continent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect walks free in germany a suspected al qaeda financier was freed from jail in germany on monday after the country 's highest court blocked his extradition to spain , dealing a new blow to german anti-terror efforts .

in partnership with powys council 's trading standards department , officers are sending young people into pubs to pose as illegal drinkers .
last year , one senior officer described the young people 's village at the show as " ibiza without the sand or sea " .
the royal welsh agricultural society said excessive drinking could result in people being ejected from the show .
the show attracts more than 200,000 people every year to its mid wales home of llanelwedd , near builth wells , and last year some 12,000 visited the young people 's village over the four days .

chief inspector steve hughson said the exercise involving children would be " strictly controlled " .
" we are engaging with trading standards to help prevent alcohol being sold to underage people , " he said .
" we have some young people aged 14 and 15 asking for beer in pubs " .
he added the young people taking part were not allowed to dress to look older than they were .
chief insp hughson said : " this will be strictly controlled and if we identify people selling alcohol to underage people then we will consider taking action . "
he added that excessive drinking among young people whether at the show or not was " always a concern " to officers .
toy-maker 's rocking sheep for rolling hills " we are working with powys drug and alcohol centre which will have outreach workers at the show advising people about substance misuse , including alcohol .
it 's a very pro-active approach , " he said .
" we will also be issuing fixed penalty notices for minor public order offences and anti-social behaviour .
a fixed penalty will cost £ 80 . "
the royal welsh agricultural society said excessive drinking could result in people being ejected .
the society said : " it will be an offence to carry alcoholic drink around the showground .
" drinking in public places , especially in the avenues , will be an evictable offence and members will run the additional risk of having their membership cancelled . "
arrests last year , dyfed-powys police 's inspector geraint rees described the young people 's " village " at the show as " ibiza without the sand or sea " .
he said police wanted to meet show organisers , licensees and others to crack down , although he said those who drank too much were in the minority .
but the young farmers ' clubs in wales said they worked closely with the authorities to make the event safe .
there were 15 arrests at last year 's show for theft and public order offences such as drunk and disorderly and assault .

paige and gretchen are two mothers who live in the east of the united states .
" we came up with mommycast mainly because i am a news junkie especially for anything that has to do with family , children , etc , " said gretchen .
" i was frustrated that i kept missing the segments on tv or radio that i wanted to listen to because i always had to tend to the children .
" i was intrigued by the possibility of providing this as a mobile medium for moms who are always on the run .
there was also in my mind the need for moms to know that everything they are dealing with is normal and that they are not alone . "
what is the podcast about ?
the weekly podcast is a mixed bag of features but generally deals with issues related to motherhood and children .
" our podcast deals with what moms go through every day - kids , household , family , etc .
" we also talk about things that moms would be interested in .
it 's basically anything that we fancy , we pass it on .
" the funny thing is , judging from our feedback a majority of our listeners are men - dads .
i think they are looking for insight into their wives ' thought processes . "
recent programmes include interviews with the mother of a soldier , a feature on a recent documentary film march of the penguins and music from unsigned groups on garageband.com.
" paige and i have a brief discussion of what has gone on in the last few days in our life and then just fly with it , " said gretchen .
she said mommycast would cotinue as long as she and paige continued to have fun .
" what all the people who are generating banter about podcasting burning out in three years is forgetting is that podcasters have a blast doing their shows , " she added .

" also on the cards is a visit to a hop farm for our regular and very popular friday beer show , gay pride and the london to brighton vintage car rally . "
mr vobes said podcasting appealed because he was in control .
" i have been at the edge of media , in as much pitching ideas to bbc and other tv stations , i have been banging on the door and everything has to go through gatekeepers .
" i realised this was a way of reaching an audience without the approval of one man saying yes .
" once you start getting feedback , you start getting a buzz . "

gene fitzpatrick and bryan minogue are two friends who make a series of low-budget documentaries about the weird , the wonderful and the outright unbelievable that takes place in small towns across the united states .
the podcast , which grew out of their film-making , is a weekly 45-minute programme which focuses on historical oddities and bizarre news stories from towns all over the country .
mr fitzpatrick said : " once podcasting came along it was a natural transition .
so we just started it and still continue the tv show . "
what is the podcast about ?
" we 're uncovering the history , folklore , legends and all unique things that make a town what it is , " says the website .
mr fitzpatrick said : " we generally start with strange news from the week .
there 's always a ghost story , ufo sighting , image of jesus in a tortilla or something bizarre that 's an interesting " tale " then those stories usually segue into other legends , folklore or historic oddities in other places .
" we always say ' every town has a tale ' and we are trying to tell them .

in the latest podcast the pair relate the story of oak island in nova scotia , a " legendary treasure island " which has been put up for sale by its owners after they decided they would never find the loot reputed to have been buried there .
