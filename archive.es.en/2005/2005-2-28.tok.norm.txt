his comments came after talks with kuwaiti prime minister sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-sabah , whose land currently holds the rotating opec presidency . oil-producing countries must also take a look at the global economic impact of the oil price , schröder said , adding that he had started an initiative at the last g8 summit to quell price speculation .
" that will be one of our main tasks in the time to come , " he said . al-sabah said it was not in the interests of the oil-producing countries for the price to rise further .
kuwait would work to keep the prices under control , he added . oil prices steadied over $ 51 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of al-sabah 's comments . the two leaders also agreed to establish a commission tasked with expanding economic cooperation between their countries .
meanwhile , engineering giant siemens signed a € 70 million -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- contract to transformers to kuwait . schröder also officially launched dw 's arabic tv service while in the kuwaiti capital . plugging diplomacy over iran earlier in the day in the saudi capital riyadh , schröder plugged diplomatic efforts on the part of germany , france and britain to resolve the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
he said it was " all of our task " to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
he said the negotiations were " promising . " speaking at a german-saudi economic forum in riyadh , the chancellor urged his audience to consider germany - and especially the country 's eastern regions - as a place to invest their money . " the german economy is definitely waiting for you to become active there as our friends and partners , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women dressed in black veil pass a wall covered with the german national flag at the same time , he also expressed his belief that " enormous possibilities " exist for german business in saudi arabia .
schröder said germany had first class engineers and architects that could help to improve saudi infrastructure .
he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .
much larger deals are expected to be finalized when schröder visits the united arab emirates in the coming days . the saudis and other arab governments have expressed interest in german defense industry products including armored vehicles , helicopters and submarines .
germany has not delivered notable amounts of military goods to saudi arabia since 1991 . addressing human rights berlin is often accused of putting business ahead of encouraging political reforms in the region .
human rights groups including amnesty international have urged schröder talk to his hosts about contentious civil rights issues while in the islamic kingdom . bildunterschrift : schröder and saudi crown prince abdullah on sunday " the chancellor ca n't simply focus on economic relations with saudi arabia , " amnesty 's middle east expert regina spöttl told the dpa news agency .
" the chancellor should stand up for the abolishment of the death penalty . " the german foreign ministry pointed out that schröder would be addressing the situation of political prisoners and lacking rights for women in saudi arabia . after talks with saudi crown prince abdullah , schröder praised the " cautious democratization " process under way in the country but said it did " not go far enough . " voters in eastern and southwestern saudi arabia will go to the polls in municipal elections on thursday .
while half of all council representatives will be elected , the other half will still be appointed by the authorities .
women can not vote nor run for election . after further talks in kuwait on tuesday , schröder will continue onward to qatar , bahrain , yemen , oman and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .

i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 the generous giver in görlitz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before and after pictures of the renovation project sponsored by mister x in görlitz every year in spring the small city of görlitz gets a giant cash windfall .
the only stipulation : the money goes towards city renovation projects and the identity of the donor remains anonymous . for eight years now , the procedure ’ s been the same .
when the weather warms up , a fax arrives in the town hall announcing a hefty donation for the city on the polish border .
no one knows who the wealthy philanthropist is or why he ’ s so generous .
all anyone knows is that the contribution – this year it ’ s 511,116 euro – is to be used for renovating the city ’ s historic buildings .
it ’ s like a fairytale .
the mysterious donor transfers the money into the city ’ s coffers without anyone knowing who ’ s behind the generous gift .
" each time it ’ s a new wonder , " says city spokesperson kerstin scholz .
there ’ s no guarantee from one year to the next , " we ’ re surprised and grateful every time " the money arrives , she said .
two conditions for mayor rolf karbaum , it ’ s the best time of the year .
he can play the easter bunny and distribute the money to the town ’ s citizens and help improve the city .
there are only two conditions : the money must be spent exclusively on the renovation and restoration of görlitz ’ historic city center , and the donor must remain anonymous .
in mid-april a committee will meet to decide how the half million euro pie will be divided .
the mystery donor is also present when the decision is made – as always incognito .
a lawyer from munich speaks on his behalf .
mayor karbaum takes the rule of the arrangement seriously .
" we don ’ t try to find out who the source of this generous gift is .
we simply accept the donation gratefully and gladly each year . "
mister x bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz applied to be europe 's 2010 culture capital , but the bid went to essen mayor karbaum leaves the speculation about the benefactor ’ s identity to others .
in a town of 62,000 news of the annual donation spreads fast , and stories quickly unfold about the possible identity of mister x. some say the donor is a rich gentleman from liechtenstein .
others say he ’ s a wealthy industrialist from lower saxony , who made a fortune manufacturing chocolate .
and still others say the philanthropist has died and that a foundation was established in honor of görlitz .
the city council prefers not to investigate the benefactor ’ s background .
" the good spirit would leave us , if we did not respect his wishes " , says scholz .
not even the mayor knows the generous giver ’ s identity .
whoever the anonymous donor is , he certainly has a special affinity for the old city center of görlitz .
the little border town has some 4,000 buildings listed on the national historic registrar .
until german unification , all of them were in serious disrepair .
thanks to mister x , many of them have been restored to their former glory .
no small sum since 1995 , the mysterious philanthropist has provided four million euro for restoring centuries old buildings and houses , a sum the city could not have afforded to spend on its own .
the people of görlitz , who have benefited greatly from the money , would like to thank the donor , but he has forbidden anyone from tracking him down , or he will stop his cash gifts in the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 28.02.2005 breathing new life into old rites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urns are largely untouchable in germany germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition . last week , the german bishops ' conference rounded off a three-day session with a call to germans not to underestimate the importance of traditional christian burials .
" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

the only stipulation : the money goes towards city renovation projects and the identity of the donor remains anonymous . for eight years now , the procedure ’ s been the same .
when the weather warms up , a fax arrives in the town hall announcing a hefty donation for the city on the polish border .
no one knows who the wealthy philanthropist is or why he ’ s so generous .
all anyone knows is that the contribution – this year it ’ s 511,116 euro – is to be used for renovating the city ’ s historic buildings .
it ’ s like a fairytale .
the mysterious donor transfers the money into the city ’ s coffers without anyone knowing who ’ s behind the generous gift .
" each time it ’ s a new wonder , " says city spokesperson kerstin scholz .
there ’ s no guarantee from one year to the next , " we ’ re surprised and grateful every time " the money arrives , she said .
two conditions for mayor rolf karbaum , it ’ s the best time of the year .
he can play the easter bunny and distribute the money to the town ’ s citizens and help improve the city .
there are only two conditions : the money must be spent exclusively on the renovation and restoration of görlitz ’ historic city center , and the donor must remain anonymous .
in mid-april a committee will meet to decide how the half million euro pie will be divided .
the mystery donor is also present when the decision is made – as always incognito .
a lawyer from munich speaks on his behalf .
mayor karbaum takes the rule of the arrangement seriously .
" we don ’ t try to find out who the source of this generous gift is .
we simply accept the donation gratefully and gladly each year . "
mister x bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : görlitz applied to be europe 's 2010 culture capital , but the bid went to essen mayor karbaum leaves the speculation about the benefactor ’ s identity to others .
in a town of 62,000 news of the annual donation spreads fast , and stories quickly unfold about the possible identity of mister x. some say the donor is a rich gentleman from liechtenstein .
others say he ’ s a wealthy industrialist from lower saxony , who made a fortune manufacturing chocolate .
and still others say the philanthropist has died and that a foundation was established in honor of görlitz .
the city council prefers not to investigate the benefactor ’ s background .
" the good spirit would leave us , if we did not respect his wishes " , says scholz .
not even the mayor knows the generous giver ’ s identity .
whoever the anonymous donor is , he certainly has a special affinity for the old city center of görlitz .
the little border town has some 4,000 buildings listed on the national historic registrar .
until german unification , all of them were in serious disrepair .
thanks to mister x , many of them have been restored to their former glory .
no small sum since 1995 , the mysterious philanthropist has provided four million euro for restoring centuries old buildings and houses , a sum the city could not have afforded to spend on its own .
the people of görlitz , who have benefited greatly from the money , would like to thank the donor , but he has forbidden anyone from tracking him down , or he will stop his cash gifts in the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

others say he ’ s a wealthy industrialist from lower saxony , who made a fortune manufacturing chocolate .
and still others say the philanthropist has died and that a foundation was established in honor of görlitz .
the city council prefers not to investigate the benefactor ’ s background .
" the good spirit would leave us , if we did not respect his wishes " , says scholz .
not even the mayor knows the generous giver ’ s identity .
whoever the anonymous donor is , he certainly has a special affinity for the old city center of görlitz .
the little border town has some 4,000 buildings listed on the national historic registrar .
until german unification , all of them were in serious disrepair .
thanks to mister x , many of them have been restored to their former glory .
no small sum since 1995 , the mysterious philanthropist has provided four million euro for restoring centuries old buildings and houses , a sum the city could not have afforded to spend on its own .
the people of görlitz , who have benefited greatly from the money , would like to thank the donor , but he has forbidden anyone from tracking him down , or he will stop his cash gifts in the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .

at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 28.02.2005 breathing new life into old rites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urns are largely untouchable in germany germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition . last week , the german bishops ' conference rounded off a three-day session with a call to germans not to underestimate the importance of traditional christian burials .
" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .
and within reason , that can scarcely be too much to ask . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church warns against alternative burials as the biannual three-day german bishops ' conference draws to a close in cloppenburg , its 69 members have come out in force against new german burial trends .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc .

" i 'll rent rooms and invite the sort of client base i want to reach , such as doctors and homeopaths , and give them a presentation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated . "
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc . " work but can she convince her business consultant ? " i plan to do it as straightforwardly as possible , " she tells siegfried machalla .
" i 'll rent rooms and invite the sort of client base i want to reach , such as doctors and homeopaths , and give them a presentation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated . "
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 28.02.2005 breathing new life into old rites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urns are largely untouchable in germany germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition . last week , the german bishops ' conference rounded off a three-day session with a call to germans not to underestimate the importance of traditional christian burials .
" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .

he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated . "
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc . " work but can she convince her business consultant ? " i plan to do it as straightforwardly as possible , " she tells siegfried machalla .
" i 'll rent rooms and invite the sort of client base i want to reach , such as doctors and homeopaths , and give them a presentation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated . "
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ?

initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no .

"
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

the decision will guarantee , at least until 2010 , the future of opel 's main german site in rüsselsheim near frankfurt , the newspaper said .
rüsselsheim was competing with saab 's trollhaettan plant to build gm 's new mid-size cars in europe , including opel 's vectra model and saab 's 9.3 , aimed at competing with bmw 's 3-series and mercedes 's c-class .
in addition , gm would base all research and development activities at the rüsselsheim site for its compact car , the opel astra .
but the future of saab 's trollhaettan plant was also secure in the medium term , since it would build the cadillac bls model until 2007 , the report added . dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
germany produces some 5.5 million cars every year , but the german car industry is most likely to remember 2004 for poor sales and industrial strikes .

" airports and airlines are job machines .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated .

according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 28.02.2005 breathing new life into old rites großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urns are largely untouchable in germany germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition . last week , the german bishops ' conference rounded off a three-day session with a call to germans not to underestimate the importance of traditional christian burials .
" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .
and within reason , that can scarcely be too much to ask . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church warns against alternative burials as the biannual three-day german bishops ' conference draws to a close in cloppenburg , its 69 members have come out in force against new german burial trends .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .
and within reason , that can scarcely be too much to ask . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church warns against alternative burials as the biannual three-day german bishops ' conference draws to a close in cloppenburg , its 69 members have come out in force against new german burial trends .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .

" that will be one of our main tasks in the time to come , " he said . al-sabah said it was not in the interests of the oil-producing countries for the price to rise further .
kuwait would work to keep the prices under control , he added . oil prices steadied over $ 51 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of al-sabah 's comments . the two leaders also agreed to establish a commission tasked with expanding economic cooperation between their countries .

he said the negotiations were " promising . " speaking at a german-saudi economic forum in riyadh , the chancellor urged his audience to consider germany - and especially the country 's eastern regions - as a place to invest their money . " the german economy is definitely waiting for you to become active there as our friends and partners , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women dressed in black veil pass a wall covered with the german national flag at the same time , he also expressed his belief that " enormous possibilities " exist for german business in saudi arabia .

he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2005 germany 's forgotten children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " blighted children " never knew their fathers a controversial book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , published both in france and germany , explores the fate of children born in france to german soldiers during wwii .
dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .

eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

his comments came after talks with kuwaiti prime minister sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-sabah , whose land currently holds the rotating opec presidency . oil-producing countries must also take a look at the global economic impact of the oil price , schröder said , adding that he had started an initiative at the last g8 summit to quell price speculation .
" that will be one of our main tasks in the time to come , " he said . al-sabah said it was not in the interests of the oil-producing countries for the price to rise further .
kuwait would work to keep the prices under control , he added . oil prices steadied over $ 51 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of al-sabah 's comments . the two leaders also agreed to establish a commission tasked with expanding economic cooperation between their countries .
meanwhile , engineering giant siemens signed a € 70 million -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- contract to transformers to kuwait . schröder also officially launched dw 's arabic tv service while in the kuwaiti capital . plugging diplomacy over iran earlier in the day in the saudi capital riyadh , schröder plugged diplomatic efforts on the part of germany , france and britain to resolve the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
he said it was " all of our task " to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
he said the negotiations were " promising . " speaking at a german-saudi economic forum in riyadh , the chancellor urged his audience to consider germany - and especially the country 's eastern regions - as a place to invest their money . " the german economy is definitely waiting for you to become active there as our friends and partners , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women dressed in black veil pass a wall covered with the german national flag at the same time , he also expressed his belief that " enormous possibilities " exist for german business in saudi arabia .
schröder said germany had first class engineers and architects that could help to improve saudi infrastructure .
he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .
much larger deals are expected to be finalized when schröder visits the united arab emirates in the coming days . the saudis and other arab governments have expressed interest in german defense industry products including armored vehicles , helicopters and submarines .
germany has not delivered notable amounts of military goods to saudi arabia since 1991 . addressing human rights berlin is often accused of putting business ahead of encouraging political reforms in the region .
human rights groups including amnesty international have urged schröder talk to his hosts about contentious civil rights issues while in the islamic kingdom . bildunterschrift : schröder and saudi crown prince abdullah on sunday " the chancellor ca n't simply focus on economic relations with saudi arabia , " amnesty 's middle east expert regina spöttl told the dpa news agency .
" the chancellor should stand up for the abolishment of the death penalty . " the german foreign ministry pointed out that schröder would be addressing the situation of political prisoners and lacking rights for women in saudi arabia . after talks with saudi crown prince abdullah , schröder praised the " cautious democratization " process under way in the country but said it did " not go far enough . " voters in eastern and southwestern saudi arabia will go to the polls in municipal elections on thursday .
while half of all council representatives will be elected , the other half will still be appointed by the authorities .
women can not vote nor run for election . after further talks in kuwait on tuesday , schröder will continue onward to qatar , bahrain , yemen , oman and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .

" grieving and remembering requires ritual and designated locations .
foregoing structured mourning and remembrance of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss , " cardinal karl lehmann said in his statement . it was a clear message to the population to do more to uphold the rigid regulations which currently govern funeral rites .
as it stands the deceased , who are to be buried within seven to fourteen days depending on the law of the relevant state , are handed over to an undertaker within a matter of a day , and do not leave his watchful eye until they are safely interred , be it in a coffin or as ashes in an urn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional graves are hard to get around for the most part germany is incredibly conservative when it comes to laying its dead to rest .
there are no open-casket last goodbyes , back-yard burials or river-side burning ceremonies , and even the scattering of ashes is still largely taboo .
" the laws in germany are too strict , too bureaucratic , and undertakers are unhappy that they can not do more to meet the changing wishes of the people , " rolf villhauer , who runs an advertising agency for undertakers , said . blazing a trail ? and the only sign of such change is in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the funeral law was changed two years ago .
" it is the only state where relatives of the dead are now allowed to physically touch the urn and to scatter the ashes themselves , " renate nixdorf , spokeswoman for the consumer initiative aeternitas said .
but even that is regulated , with woodland areas set aside as designated final resting places for the less conventionally minded . as for the rest of the country , one of the only ways to circumnavigate the rules is to have the body of the deceased transported to holland for cremation there .
it 's big business for funeral directors such as karl schumacher .
" there is a definite trend towards cremation in holland , where after 30 days , the relatives of the deceased can collect the urn themselves and scatter the ashes on dutch ground . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unsual for relatives to be present at german cremations if , however , an urn is brought back across the border , german law comes into immediate effect , compelling its burial .
" it is estimated that some 10,000 urns are brought over the border illegally each year .
anyone who gets caught has to hand the ashes over to the authorities to be interred in a cemetery .
but there are no fines and no punishment involved , so people do n't mind taking the risk , " said nixdorf . a fine price to pay karl schumacher , whose undertaking business deals with the last arrangements for some 2,500 people each year , says that for many , that final voyage across the dutch border is as much about money as anything else .
and with the average german funeral costing € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,660 -rrb- , it 's not hard to see how the need might arise . up until recently , the government helped to ease the financial burden by contributing € 500 to the undertaking bill , but that little luxury has been dispensed with , leaving each to his own solution . for many , the first thing to go is the headstone .
anonymous graves were first introduced into german cemeteries back in the early nineties , and they have caught on .
but it is precisely such trends which have the catholic church and others in a state of mild consternation . " the clear increase in anonymous graves signifies a break with the culture of remembrance in germany , and we must consider the possibility that this anonymity might be abused by people who are trying , in some way to punish the dead for their behaviour during their lives , " a spokesman for the german bishops ' conference said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lease is up , it 's pay up or make space that 's one theory , yet unlikely a decisive reality .
at the heart of the matter are simple mathematics , as besides the cost of the funeral itself , relatives also have to pay to lease the graveyard plot for anything between 20 and 30 years . " relatives have the choice to extend the lease when it expires , but if they decline , they have to move the headstone , and the plot is re-dug for a new coffin .
in some cases , the cemetery authorities offer to do the job , but at a cost , " renate nixdorf said . alternative burials having to clear one 's grave after the lease has run out , not only sounds like a slap in the face for resting in peace , but it also contradicts the idea that a marked grave is a must .
what happens once the headstone is gone and the spatial association is removed , or moreover occupied by a completely new inhabitant with its own grieving family ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans would like to have their ashes scattered in woodlands surely that is an argument worthy of serious consideration among those who make and review laws governing burial practices .
ashes scattered into the wind from the top of a hill or tipped into the ground at the base of a specially-planted tree would not only signify the granting of a last wish , but would also provide a chance for eternal association to be handed down through the generations with no cost to anyone . in a nationwide survey conducted by aeternitas last year , some 30 percent of germans said they would like to see a broader range of burial options . " we believe that the laws in germany should be opened up so that everyone should be buried as he or she chooses , " renate nixdorf said .
and within reason , that can scarcely be too much to ask . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church warns against alternative burials as the biannual three-day german bishops ' conference draws to a close in cloppenburg , its 69 members have come out in force against new german burial trends .

his comments came after talks with kuwaiti prime minister sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-sabah , whose land currently holds the rotating opec presidency . oil-producing countries must also take a look at the global economic impact of the oil price , schröder said , adding that he had started an initiative at the last g8 summit to quell price speculation .
" that will be one of our main tasks in the time to come , " he said . al-sabah said it was not in the interests of the oil-producing countries for the price to rise further .
kuwait would work to keep the prices under control , he added . oil prices steadied over $ 51 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of al-sabah 's comments . the two leaders also agreed to establish a commission tasked with expanding economic cooperation between their countries .

he said it was " all of our task " to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
he said the negotiations were " promising . " speaking at a german-saudi economic forum in riyadh , the chancellor urged his audience to consider germany - and especially the country 's eastern regions - as a place to invest their money . " the german economy is definitely waiting for you to become active there as our friends and partners , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women dressed in black veil pass a wall covered with the german national flag at the same time , he also expressed his belief that " enormous possibilities " exist for german business in saudi arabia .
schröder said germany had first class engineers and architects that could help to improve saudi infrastructure .
he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .
much larger deals are expected to be finalized when schröder visits the united arab emirates in the coming days . the saudis and other arab governments have expressed interest in german defense industry products including armored vehicles , helicopters and submarines .

" the chancellor should stand up for the abolishment of the death penalty . " the german foreign ministry pointed out that schröder would be addressing the situation of political prisoners and lacking rights for women in saudi arabia . after talks with saudi crown prince abdullah , schröder praised the " cautious democratization " process under way in the country but said it did " not go far enough . " voters in eastern and southwestern saudi arabia will go to the polls in municipal elections on thursday .
while half of all council representatives will be elected , the other half will still be appointed by the authorities .
women can not vote nor run for election . after further talks in kuwait on tuesday , schröder will continue onward to qatar , bahrain , yemen , oman and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .

a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says .

" the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no .

according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

if successful , they often find themselves boosting cottage industries back home . it 's thursday afternoon and mouna beeck is meeting her management consultant .
a german-moroccan , she 's trying to convince him that what germany needs is argan oil - a luxury product made from the fruit of the argan tree harvested in the wilds of southern morocco .
and she wants to import it .
" it 's ideal for cooking , " she explains .
" and it 's also a great product for bons vivants , people who like the good things in life . "
as well as a treat for gourmets , it has useful medical benefits .
" when it 's cold-pressed , it 's an excellent moisturizer because as a disinfectant , it kills fungi , " she says . " that 's why it 's called ' moroccan liquid gold ' , " she adds , stressing that the rare exotic oil still is n't widely available in germany despite its growing international popularity . making " me inc . " work but can she convince her business consultant ? " i plan to do it as straightforwardly as possible , " she tells siegfried machalla .
" i 'll rent rooms and invite the sort of client base i want to reach , such as doctors and homeopaths , and give them a presentation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobseekers sit and wait at the german employment agency 's office in duisburg , western germany .
a trained digital media designer , mouna beeck found herself joining the ranks of germany 's unemployed at the labor office following her graduation . aware that the introduction of the government ’ s controversial " hartz iv " welfare and labor market reforms in january would entail a reduction in her benefits , she decided to look into the new " me incorporated " scheme launched in 2003 . the first step was a two-day seminar for aspiring entrepreneurs . " the job agency offers workshops for candidates so that they can overcome the first obstacles , " says machalla .
" that way they get to find out what to expect when they set up their own company . " once they 've been taught the ropes , the next move is to discuss the business plan with a management consultant , available to the budding richard bransons for a total of 16 hours .
once the plan has been fleshed out , all that 's needed is an expert recommendation . " a lot of people have an idea and they 're convinced it 's going to work , " he says .
" but often they lack the business know-how .
that 's why an expert has to assess the plan and say yes or no . " in the case of mouna beeck , machalla did n't need to think twice . a fair trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grooming for dogs from customized teddy bears to hairdressers for dogs , there 's been no shortage of unusual ideas for " me incorporated . "
according to machalla , the trend with immigrant entrepreneurs - such as mouna beeck - is importing products from their country of origin . if it 's successful , the plan can be doubly advantageous - both to the entrepreneur and to the local industry where the product is made . the berber women of the atlas mountain region have been producing argan oil for thousands of years and beeck 's business would be a welcome boon to their cottage industry . " my idea is not just to do something for myself , " she stresses , explaining that she 'd like " a job which allows me to help others , too .
i 'd like to set up a women 's cooperative for the women who make the oil by hand , so they can finance their families or buy what they need , such as food and clothes .

his comments came after talks with kuwaiti prime minister sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-sabah , whose land currently holds the rotating opec presidency . oil-producing countries must also take a look at the global economic impact of the oil price , schröder said , adding that he had started an initiative at the last g8 summit to quell price speculation .
" that will be one of our main tasks in the time to come , " he said . al-sabah said it was not in the interests of the oil-producing countries for the price to rise further .
kuwait would work to keep the prices under control , he added . oil prices steadied over $ 51 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of al-sabah 's comments . the two leaders also agreed to establish a commission tasked with expanding economic cooperation between their countries .
meanwhile , engineering giant siemens signed a € 70 million -lrb- $ 93 million -rrb- contract to transformers to kuwait . schröder also officially launched dw 's arabic tv service while in the kuwaiti capital . plugging diplomacy over iran earlier in the day in the saudi capital riyadh , schröder plugged diplomatic efforts on the part of germany , france and britain to resolve the conflict over iran 's nuclear program .
he said it was " all of our task " to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
he said the negotiations were " promising . " speaking at a german-saudi economic forum in riyadh , the chancellor urged his audience to consider germany - and especially the country 's eastern regions - as a place to invest their money . " the german economy is definitely waiting for you to become active there as our friends and partners , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women dressed in black veil pass a wall covered with the german national flag at the same time , he also expressed his belief that " enormous possibilities " exist for german business in saudi arabia .
schröder said germany had first class engineers and architects that could help to improve saudi infrastructure .
he added that german companies working abroad did a lot to train young local employees . while schröder 's comments were focused on future economic cooperation , german businesspeople were already able to sign treaties totaling € 18 million -lrb- $ 23.8 million -rrb- for telecommunications and consulting services as well as the expansion of an airport .
much larger deals are expected to be finalized when schröder visits the united arab emirates in the coming days . the saudis and other arab governments have expressed interest in german defense industry products including armored vehicles , helicopters and submarines .
germany has not delivered notable amounts of military goods to saudi arabia since 1991 . addressing human rights berlin is often accused of putting business ahead of encouraging political reforms in the region .
human rights groups including amnesty international have urged schröder talk to his hosts about contentious civil rights issues while in the islamic kingdom . bildunterschrift : schröder and saudi crown prince abdullah on sunday " the chancellor ca n't simply focus on economic relations with saudi arabia , " amnesty 's middle east expert regina spöttl told the dpa news agency .
" the chancellor should stand up for the abolishment of the death penalty . " the german foreign ministry pointed out that schröder would be addressing the situation of political prisoners and lacking rights for women in saudi arabia . after talks with saudi crown prince abdullah , schröder praised the " cautious democratization " process under way in the country but said it did " not go far enough . " voters in eastern and southwestern saudi arabia will go to the polls in municipal elections on thursday .
while half of all council representatives will be elected , the other half will still be appointed by the authorities .
women can not vote nor run for election . after further talks in kuwait on tuesday , schröder will continue onward to qatar , bahrain , yemen , oman and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- .

dw-world spoke to author jean-paul picaper . dw-world : 60 years after the end of the second world war , you 've written a book about children born during the nazi occupation in france who were fathered by german soldiers .
what made you decide to tackle this topic ? jean-paul picaper : i published an article in france about the son of a gi who wanted to track down his father .
at the time , i was the berlin correspondent for the newspaper le figaro .
i subsequently received a reader 's letter from a frenchman who was born during wwii as the son of a german soldier , who wanted to know why i did n't write about the tens of thousands of children in france fathered by german soldiers . i told him that if there were really that many , the story was worth a book rather than just an article .
initially i could n't find a publisher , because they all felt it was such a sensitive subject and would cause too many people too much embarrassment .
eventually i found a publisher who was interested in the issue because her aunt was the daughter of a german soldier . how did you manage to track down these " cursed children ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henri philippe petain served as prime minister of the nazi-supported vichy government in occupied france that was initially my biggest problem .
but in 2002 , i met ludwig norz , a historian at the wehrmacht -lrb- german army -rrb- archive in berlin .
he told me the archive had received many letters from people in france trying to locate their fathers .
that 's how he and i began working together .
the archive then wrote to some 30 to 40 people asking them if they 'd be willing to talk to me .
almost all of them agreed .
so i went to france and interviewed 15 to 20 of them .
many of them did n't even know there were other people with similar backgrounds and were hugely relieved to find out they were n't alone . several people in the book remain anonymous .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldiers stands guard at his machine gun in a dugout at an unknown location along the english channel coastline , in nazi-occupied france , on june 25 , 1942 some of them did n't want to reveal their identity because they were worried about the publicity .
there was one person whose mother had been sentenced to jail as a collaborator , and she did n't want her neighbors to find out .
all she 'd done was fall in love with a german soldier .
but that 's how french courts worked back in 1944-46 - there was no trial , just martial law , without witnesses or evidence .
then there was the senior civil servant who 'd got where he was because he was the son of a famous resistance fighter .
he was worried his career would be over if it came to light that he was the son of a german soldier .
four of the 16 people featured in the book have therfore had their names changed . these children often suffered terrible fates - abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society .
was this the standard story ? unfortunately , yes .
there was some very anti-german feeling in france right up until the late 1950s .
it was n't until the elysée treaty was signed by de gaulle and adenauer in 1963 that the mood changed . does the book also serve as a reminder that resistance to the german occupation was n't as widespread as believed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians with their hastily made american and french flags sing the " star spangled banner " as they greet u.s. and free french troops entering paris , france , aug .
25 , 1944 definitely . barely two percent of the population belonged to the resistance .
even in early 1945 , marshall pétain -lrb- photo above -rrb- , the head of france 's pro-german vichy government , was cheered by the public in paris - despite the occupation , mass shootings , and widespread suffering and hunger . was the way the children were treated a delayed reaction to the occupying forces ? ultimately , the majority of the french population was completely passive .
but history was rewritten in such a way that the french were turned into victims and heroes , with the children made the nation 's scapegoats .
it was hard enough to be a child born out of wedlock , let alone to be a child of the enemy .
some of the women known to have had affairs with germans were chased through the streets after the war .
their heads were shaved , some were allegedly executed .
there are 26,000 known cases of women being punished for having relationships with german soldiers , and according to our estimates , ten times as many relationships .
we believe there were 200,000 children fathered by germans .
we 'll never know why these women did what they did .
maybe some of them were seduced by the material benefits - women with german boyfriends often had jobs with the wehrmacht , in restaurants , casinos , hospitals and so on .
the relationships tended to develop in the areas where the germans were stationed for longer periods , on the atlantic coast and on the channel .
the incidence of rape and harassment was no higher during the war than it was during peace time . how was the book received in france ? the media were very enthusiastic , because the issue had never been addressed before .
there had been books about the mothers , but never about the children .
it was interesting to realize that these victims of the war were n't actually victims of violence .
and our timing was perfect : the children were over 60 , retired and with time to reflect on their lives .
and france is beginning to think more deeply about its past .
there 's a growing interest in a version of history that 's free of taboos . does germany have a responsibility to these people ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters reenact the hoisting of the french flag after the liberation in 1944 atop the eiffel tower in 2004 first and foremost , france has a responsibility .
but germany is guilty too . by 1949 it should have realized that german soldiers did n't only perpetrate massacres in france , they also left behind children .
it should have set up a fund for them .
they should have been given help in finding their fathers .
and we want these people to be awarded dual citizenship .
the issue can be seen as one of the last unresolved problems between france and germany .
the fathers never acknowledged their children , because they were n't allowed to . many of the soldiers were sent elsewhere and never even knew of the existence of their children .
but germany could acknowledge them now .
it would one way of making amends . pascal pfitzenmaier interviewed jean-paul picaper -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the cross-border collaboration in the past , franco-german relations had their ups and downs , but the modern partnership is strong .
cooperation initiatives like the euro-district around strasbourg and kehl could pave the way for even closer ties . -lrb- oct .
26 , 2004 -rrb- dw-world : france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers .

london mayor ken livingstone wants to raise the toll for entering central london by £ 3 for private cars .
commercial fleet vehicles would pay £ 7 .
according to the mayor 's office , the proposed rise would bring in an extra £ 50m to £ 60m per year and see traffic cut by a further 5 % .
mr livingstone said the earliest the rise could be introduced is july .
the charge , introduced in february 2003 , has been credited with reducing congestion in central london by 30 % with 70,000 fewer vehicles entering the zone .
mayor 's proposals a rise in the charge from £ 5 to £ 8 a 15 % reduction for those paying monthly or annually by giving annual payers 40 free days and monthly payers three days free amending the current fleet scheme by reducing the number of vehicles needed to participate from 25 to 10 and allowing cars to be counted as well as vans and lorries a freeze in the late payment fee levied between 10pm and midnight at £ 10 reducing the charge for registering a change of car increasing the number of petrol stations where the charge can be paid launching the consultation last november , mr livingstone said : " the congestion charge has been an unprecedented success in dramatically reducing congestion , pollution and accidents .

brought in as part of an effort by the academy to freshen up the awards , rock - who received a standing ovation before uttering a word - ordered the assembled a-listers to " sit your asses down " .
but - unlike david letterman , a notorious flop as host - rock , only the fifth presenter since 1990 , was wise enough not to turn the academy awards into a four-hour long stand-up gig .
instead , he relaxed and let his natural wit sparkle - without having to enter into a tirade of swear words , as some tv executives had feared .
five-second delay rock began with a opening monologue that took in hollywood 's " black " movies , president bush 's record in office - and some ego-deflating digs at other actors .
chris rock 's best quotes " it 's a great night tonight .
we have four black nominees tonight .
it 's kinda like def oscar jam tonight " " -lsb- cate blanchett -rsb- was so convincing -lsb- as katharine hepburn -rsb- that sidney poitier showed up at her house for supper " " the only acting you ever see at the oscars is when people act like they 're not mad they lost " " nicole kidman was smiling so wide , she should have won an emmy at the oscars for her great performance .
i was like , if you 'd done that in the movie , you 'd have won an oscar , girl " " they like to say there 's over 100 stars out tonight .
no there 's not .
there 's only four real stars .
the rest are just popular people .
clint eastwood is a star .
that 's a star .
tobey maguire is just a boy in tights " " you want russell crowe and all you can get is colin farrell ?
wait .
alexander is not gladiator " " black movies do n't have real names , they have names like barbershop .
that 's not a name , it 's just a location " " who is jude law ?
why is he in every movie i have seen in the last four years ?
even if he 's not acting in , if you look at the credits he makes the cupcakes or something " he described spiderman 's tobey maguire as " just a boy in tights " and laid into british actor jude law , " in every movie i have seen in the last four years " .
indeed , that comment would later earn rock a rebuke from sean penn - announcing the best actress award - who asked that the academy " forgive my lack of humour ...
jude law is one of our most talented actors " .
rock did however highlight his own film failings , a trick perhaps learned from legendary host bob hope .
" you want denzel -lsb- washington -rsb- and all you can get is me ?
wait , " he deadpanned , before adding , " denzel 's a fine actor .
he would never have made pootie tang . "
in truth , rock was never in danger of requiring the five-second delay placed on the coverage .
however , perennial oscars host robin williams came closer to testing the censors .
having allegedly been told he was not to refer to a protest by a conservative group about " gay " cartoon characters , williams walked on stage with a piece of paper stuffed in his mouth - before taking it out and announcing that " -lsb- spongebob -rsb- squarepants is not gay " .
" tight pants , maybe .
spongebob hot pants , you go girl .
what about donald duck ?
little sailor top , no pants ...
bugs bunny ?
in more dresses than j edgar hoover at mardi gras . "
carson tribute but in keeping with the new , brisk tone of a show that traditionally overruns long into the night , rock did not hang around between awards ; a quick one-liner and then it was on with the next presenter .
the result was that the entire show ran for nearly an entire hour less than usual .
rock and adam sandler shared a prolonged sketch surrounding catherine zeta jones other innovations to speed things up included cate blanchett presenting an award from the audience next to the winners , where they accepted it standing next to their seats .
and some of the less high-profile awards saw all of the nominees head to the stage at the same time .
the winners then simply accepted the award while the less successful walked quietly away .
this prompted rock to joke that next year the awards would be handed out in the car park : " drive through and get your oscar . "
however , rock was not the only comedy highlight - pierce brosnan 's appearance alongside the incredible 's edna mode worked very well .
less successful was the somewhat surreal teaming of beyonce knowles and sir andrew lloyd webber on piano .
on a more serious note was a tribute to the late johnny carson , who was a five-time oscar host himself .
a selection of carson 's best lines was finished with an emotional little " goodnight " .
meanwhile , there would seem to be little doubt that rock will be invited back .
the comedian had admitted before the awards that he intended to tour europe and worldwide afterwards - effectively using the oscars to boost his own prospects .
in return , he was to provide the oscars with a younger , wider audience in a year where the films on display have attracted fewer audiences than at any time since 1983 .

brought in as part of an effort by the academy to freshen up the awards , rock - who received a standing ovation before uttering a word - ordered the assembled a-listers to " sit your asses down " .
but - unlike david letterman , a notorious flop as host - rock , only the fifth presenter since 1990 , was wise enough not to turn the academy awards into a four-hour long stand-up gig .
instead , he relaxed and let his natural wit sparkle - without having to enter into a tirade of swear words , as some tv executives had feared .
five-second delay rock began with a opening monologue that took in hollywood 's " black " movies , president bush 's record in office - and some ego-deflating digs at other actors .
chris rock 's best quotes " it 's a great night tonight .
we have four black nominees tonight .
it 's kinda like def oscar jam tonight " " -lsb- cate blanchett -rsb- was so convincing -lsb- as katharine hepburn -rsb- that sidney poitier showed up at her house for supper " " the only acting you ever see at the oscars is when people act like they 're not mad they lost " " nicole kidman was smiling so wide , she should have won an emmy at the oscars for her great performance .
i was like , if you 'd done that in the movie , you 'd have won an oscar , girl " " they like to say there 's over 100 stars out tonight .
no there 's not .
there 's only four real stars .
the rest are just popular people .
clint eastwood is a star .
that 's a star .
tobey maguire is just a boy in tights " " you want russell crowe and all you can get is colin farrell ?
wait .
alexander is not gladiator " " black movies do n't have real names , they have names like barbershop .
that 's not a name , it 's just a location " " who is jude law ?
why is he in every movie i have seen in the last four years ?
even if he 's not acting in , if you look at the credits he makes the cupcakes or something " he described spiderman 's tobey maguire as " just a boy in tights " and laid into british actor jude law , " in every movie i have seen in the last four years " .
indeed , that comment would later earn rock a rebuke from sean penn - announcing the best actress award - who asked that the academy " forgive my lack of humour ...
jude law is one of our most talented actors " .
rock did however highlight his own film failings , a trick perhaps learned from legendary host bob hope .
" you want denzel -lsb- washington -rsb- and all you can get is me ?
wait , " he deadpanned , before adding , " denzel 's a fine actor .
he would never have made pootie tang . "
in truth , rock was never in danger of requiring the five-second delay placed on the coverage .
however , perennial oscars host robin williams came closer to testing the censors .
having allegedly been told he was not to refer to a protest by a conservative group about " gay " cartoon characters , williams walked on stage with a piece of paper stuffed in his mouth - before taking it out and announcing that " -lsb- spongebob -rsb- squarepants is not gay " .
" tight pants , maybe .
spongebob hot pants , you go girl .
what about donald duck ?
little sailor top , no pants ...
bugs bunny ?
in more dresses than j edgar hoover at mardi gras . "
carson tribute but in keeping with the new , brisk tone of a show that traditionally overruns long into the night , rock did not hang around between awards ; a quick one-liner and then it was on with the next presenter .
the result was that the entire show ran for nearly an entire hour less than usual .
rock and adam sandler shared a prolonged sketch surrounding catherine zeta jones other innovations to speed things up included cate blanchett presenting an award from the audience next to the winners , where they accepted it standing next to their seats .
and some of the less high-profile awards saw all of the nominees head to the stage at the same time .
the winners then simply accepted the award while the less successful walked quietly away .
this prompted rock to joke that next year the awards would be handed out in the car park : " drive through and get your oscar . "
however , rock was not the only comedy highlight - pierce brosnan 's appearance alongside the incredible 's edna mode worked very well .
less successful was the somewhat surreal teaming of beyonce knowles and sir andrew lloyd webber on piano .
on a more serious note was a tribute to the late johnny carson , who was a five-time oscar host himself .
a selection of carson 's best lines was finished with an emotional little " goodnight " .
meanwhile , there would seem to be little doubt that rock will be invited back .
the comedian had admitted before the awards that he intended to tour europe and worldwide afterwards - effectively using the oscars to boost his own prospects .
in return , he was to provide the oscars with a younger , wider audience in a year where the films on display have attracted fewer audiences than at any time since 1983 .
whether he has been successful will only be borne out by viewing figures - but rock 's first stint as oscar host will not have done his own career any harm at all .

having allegedly been told he was not to refer to a protest by a conservative group about " gay " cartoon characters , williams walked on stage with a piece of paper stuffed in his mouth - before taking it out and announcing that " -lsb- spongebob -rsb- squarepants is not gay " .
" tight pants , maybe .
spongebob hot pants , you go girl .
what about donald duck ?
little sailor top , no pants ...
bugs bunny ?
in more dresses than j edgar hoover at mardi gras . "
carson tribute but in keeping with the new , brisk tone of a show that traditionally overruns long into the night , rock did not hang around between awards ; a quick one-liner and then it was on with the next presenter .
the result was that the entire show ran for nearly an entire hour less than usual .
rock and adam sandler shared a prolonged sketch surrounding catherine zeta jones other innovations to speed things up included cate blanchett presenting an award from the audience next to the winners , where they accepted it standing next to their seats .
and some of the less high-profile awards saw all of the nominees head to the stage at the same time .
the winners then simply accepted the award while the less successful walked quietly away .
this prompted rock to joke that next year the awards would be handed out in the car park : " drive through and get your oscar . "
however , rock was not the only comedy highlight - pierce brosnan 's appearance alongside the incredible 's edna mode worked very well .
less successful was the somewhat surreal teaming of beyonce knowles and sir andrew lloyd webber on piano .
on a more serious note was a tribute to the late johnny carson , who was a five-time oscar host himself .
a selection of carson 's best lines was finished with an emotional little " goodnight " .
meanwhile , there would seem to be little doubt that rock will be invited back .
the comedian had admitted before the awards that he intended to tour europe and worldwide afterwards - effectively using the oscars to boost his own prospects .
in return , he was to provide the oscars with a younger , wider audience in a year where the films on display have attracted fewer audiences than at any time since 1983 .
whether he has been successful will only be borne out by viewing figures - but rock 's first stint as oscar host will not have done his own career any harm at all .

brought in as part of an effort by the academy to freshen up the awards , rock - who received a standing ovation before uttering a word - ordered the assembled a-listers to " sit your asses down " .
but - unlike david letterman , a notorious flop as host - rock , only the fifth presenter since 1990 , was wise enough not to turn the academy awards into a four-hour long stand-up gig .
instead , he relaxed and let his natural wit sparkle - without having to enter into a tirade of swear words , as some tv executives had feared .
five-second delay rock began with a opening monologue that took in hollywood 's " black " movies , president bush 's record in office - and some ego-deflating digs at other actors .

that 's not a name , it 's just a location " " who is jude law ?
why is he in every movie i have seen in the last four years ?
even if he 's not acting in , if you look at the credits he makes the cupcakes or something " he described spiderman 's tobey maguire as " just a boy in tights " and laid into british actor jude law , " in every movie i have seen in the last four years " .
indeed , that comment would later earn rock a rebuke from sean penn - announcing the best actress award - who asked that the academy " forgive my lack of humour ...
jude law is one of our most talented actors " .
rock did however highlight his own film failings , a trick perhaps learned from legendary host bob hope .
" you want denzel -lsb- washington -rsb- and all you can get is me ?

and after she whipped me , she would talk to me and tell me why she whipped me .
she said i want you to be a southern gentleman .
she still talks to me now .
only now , she talks to me in my dreams .

repainting the menai bridge , between bangor and anglesey , will take eight months and is likely to cause major disruption for motorists .
thomas telford 's bridge was last painted in the 1990s but because of the many layers of paint it now needs to be completely stripped back to bare metal .
the structure has not had such major work since 1939 .
once it is clear of the old paint , four new layers will be applied to the bridge , which was built in 1826 .
at hundreds of feet above the waters of the menai strait , the job is far from straightforward for the painters .
drivers wanting to cross the bridge will find a one-way system in place , which will run in different directions at different times of the day .
from 0600 gmt to 1400 gmt , traffic will flow from anglesey to the mainland .
it will then switch to the opposite direction from 1400 gmt to 0600 gmt the following morning .
the britannia bridge will be open in both directions , but it can be subject to closures to lorries especially in high wind .
in the event of an emergency , ambulance and fire services will be able to use the bridge against the direction of traffic flow , which could add to delays .
full overnight closures will also take place from time to time .
