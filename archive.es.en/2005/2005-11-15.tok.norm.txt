program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2005 broadcasters in bidding war over soccer coverage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angling for more exclusivity , but at the fans ' expense ?
might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .
mentioning fan resistance to pushing back " sportschau " in the past , he added " it is n't worth it to make money in the short term if you hurt your product in the long term .

the ruling comes in response to us supermarket chain wal-mart 's company policy banning any sign of attraction between its workers . a court in the city of düsseldorf ruled that the german subsidiary of the world 's largest retailer , wal-mart , was acting outside the law in trying to impose restrictions on the nature of relationships allowed between its employees . the court said that while such regulations might be acceptable and indeed common practice in the us , they are neither compatible with german labor law nor the personal rights of employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart wants none of that wal-mart introduced a code of ethical conduct earlier in the year .
it prohibits company employees from dating or falling in love with a colleague in a position of influence , and from exchanging lustful glances or flirting in any way . in its 28-page code , the discount chain , requests that its workers report anyone observed to be breaking the rules , via a special telephone hotline .
failure to comply with the rules can lead to the termination of an employment contract . the ruling means that the 10,500 employees can get on with flirtation as usual without worrying about being stabbed in the back by officious colleagues . employee protectio n but gregor sobotta , personnel manager at wal-mart germany , said the company 's policy has been misunderstood .

might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .
mentioning fan resistance to pushing back " sportschau " in the past , he added " it is n't worth it to make money in the short term if you hurt your product in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2005 broadcasters in bidding war over soccer coverage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angling for more exclusivity , but at the fans ' expense ?
might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .
mentioning fan resistance to pushing back " sportschau " in the past , he added " it is n't worth it to make money in the short term if you hurt your product in the long term .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .

one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .

one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2005 broadcasters in bidding war over soccer coverage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angling for more exclusivity , but at the fans ' expense ?
might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .
mentioning fan resistance to pushing back " sportschau " in the past , he added " it is n't worth it to make money in the short term if you hurt your product in the long term .

she had appointed a debarred right-wing extremist as her legal assistant . on the second day of the trial against neo-nazi ernst zündel in mannheim , judge ulrich meinerzhagen announced that a new lawyer would have to be assigned to defend the 66-year old . attorney sylvia stolz had appointed horst mahler , a debarred lawyer and well-known right-wing extremist , as her legal assistant .
the judge said this was legally punishable .
he dismissed both stolz and mahler from the defense on the first day of the trial last week . meinerzhagen said a new defender would need time to prepare , which was no longer possible in the midst of the current trial .
no date for a new trial was given . zündel , who had been deported by canada to germany in march , faces charges of inciting racial hatred .
meinerzhagen said he would remain in pre-trial detention and that the trial 's collapse was entirely due to the defense team .

in january , he was convicted of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to nine months in jail . the defense team had earlier in the day attempted to have the judge recused from the trial for alleged bias , but the court rejected the petition as unfounded .

might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

the ruling comes in response to us supermarket chain wal-mart 's company policy banning any sign of attraction between its workers . a court in the city of düsseldorf ruled that the german subsidiary of the world 's largest retailer , wal-mart , was acting outside the law in trying to impose restrictions on the nature of relationships allowed between its employees . the court said that while such regulations might be acceptable and indeed common practice in the us , they are neither compatible with german labor law nor the personal rights of employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart wants none of that wal-mart introduced a code of ethical conduct earlier in the year .
it prohibits company employees from dating or falling in love with a colleague in a position of influence , and from exchanging lustful glances or flirting in any way . in its 28-page code , the discount chain , requests that its workers report anyone observed to be breaking the rules , via a special telephone hotline .
failure to comply with the rules can lead to the termination of an employment contract . the ruling means that the 10,500 employees can get on with flirtation as usual without worrying about being stabbed in the back by officious colleagues . employee protectio n but gregor sobotta , personnel manager at wal-mart germany , said the company 's policy has been misunderstood . " the measures were intended to protect our employees against exertion of influence , corruption or sexual harassment in the workplace , " he said , adding that no employee should be disadvantaged on the grounds of a love match with a superior , and said that the company would deal with such situations by simply moving one of the workers concerned to a different department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart ensures its hotline callers anonymity wal-mart can officially appeal the tribunal 's ruling , but sobotta said there will be no decision on that until they have received the court 's reasons on paper .
following the ruling , however , he said he would be holding talks with the company 's workers ' council in a bid to banish fears , clear up misunderstandings , and come up with an acceptable set of rules for the protection of the workers . in defense of the hotline , to which the workers ' council has voiced opposition , the head of personnel moved to assure employees that it is totally anonymous .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 15.11.2005 german hip hop culture in the holy land großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumentopf : germany 's hip-hop ambassadors to the middle east sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east . blumentopf -lrb- german for flowerpot -rrb- took the stage in nazareth dressed in full jerseys from the local soccer team .
before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

she had appointed a debarred right-wing extremist as her legal assistant . on the second day of the trial against neo-nazi ernst zündel in mannheim , judge ulrich meinerzhagen announced that a new lawyer would have to be assigned to defend the 66-year old . attorney sylvia stolz had appointed horst mahler , a debarred lawyer and well-known right-wing extremist , as her legal assistant .
the judge said this was legally punishable .
he dismissed both stolz and mahler from the defense on the first day of the trial last week . meinerzhagen said a new defender would need time to prepare , which was no longer possible in the midst of the current trial .
no date for a new trial was given . zündel , who had been deported by canada to germany in march , faces charges of inciting racial hatred .
meinerzhagen said he would remain in pre-trial detention and that the trial 's collapse was entirely due to the defense team .

in january , he was convicted of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to nine months in jail . the defense team had earlier in the day attempted to have the judge recused from the trial for alleged bias , but the court rejected the petition as unfounded .
it also turned down the defense 's appeal to have the trial closed to the public . the district attorney 's office said it was unlikely a new trial would start before next year . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazi trial in germany begins the trial of one the world 's most notorious holocaust deniers , ernst zündel , was postponed shortly after it started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 15.11.2005 german hip hop culture in the holy land großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumentopf : germany 's hip-hop ambassadors to the middle east sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east . blumentopf -lrb- german for flowerpot -rrb- took the stage in nazareth dressed in full jerseys from the local soccer team .
before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 15.11.2005 german hip hop culture in the holy land großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumentopf : germany 's hip-hop ambassadors to the middle east sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east . blumentopf -lrb- german for flowerpot -rrb- took the stage in nazareth dressed in full jerseys from the local soccer team .
before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 15.11.2005 german hip hop culture in the holy land großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumentopf : germany 's hip-hop ambassadors to the middle east sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east . blumentopf -lrb- german for flowerpot -rrb- took the stage in nazareth dressed in full jerseys from the local soccer team .
before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .
mentioning fan resistance to pushing back " sportschau " in the past , he added " it is n't worth it to make money in the short term if you hurt your product in the long term .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

might german soccer get less fan-friendly ?
plans to change the broadcast time of soccer 's weekly highlight show have raised the hackles of fans and could mark a sea change in german television . one of the earliest memories for many a german soccer fan is of gathering around the television on a saturday evening to watch the highlights of that day 's bundesliga matches . should pay tv channel premiere get its way , that will change . the munich-based company is the frontrunner in a current bidding war for the rights to broadcast bundesliga matches .
though few doubt their chances at winning the rights , premiere 's demands for unparalleled exclusivity has turned the german soccer world upside down . in exchange for the 260 million euros -lrb- $ 304 million -rrb- experts say premiere is likely to pay the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- for the rights to broadcast matches , the pay tv channel wants to push public television 's saturday evening show , sportschau , into the nether regions of saturday night programming . germans are now able to watch sportschau on free public television only an hour after premiere finishes broadcasting matches . but premiere ceo georg kofler wants the show pushed from 6:10 p.m. to at least 10 p.m. , a move experts say will mean the loss of many of the show 's 6 million viewers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere ceo georg kofler " it just ca n't be that games are shown on free tv directly after pay tv shows them , " kofler , whose company has paid 180 million euros annually for bundesliga rights for the past two seasons , said in a statement . goi n g the way of fra n ce a n d e n gla n d ? the prospect has horrified soccer purists and sparked concerns that germany , the last bastion of inexpensive television in europe , will soon go the way of england , france and italy . in contrast to the english and french , germans have for decades enjoyed a large number and variety of channels and tv programming - including soccer highlights - for the small monthly fee they pay to the country 's public broadcasters .
their right to " basic " tv programming has been reaffirmed by the country 's highest court .
most viewers would consider the national sport " basic , " if not life-essential . " soccer at six is the right time , " said andreas sürken , the owner of the berlin soccer bar magnet mitte .
" it 's a public commodity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard has broadcast the sportschau for the past two seasons over the past two years , public broadcaster ard paid an estimated annual 60 million euros to rebroadcast highlights of the matches .
though ard understands the dfl 's desire for more money , they warn against upsetting fans for short-term gain . " you ca n't just take millions of viewers hostage because you want more money , " fritz pleitgen , the director general of wdr , one of the ard 's regional broadcasters , said in a statement . the begi n n i n g of a cha n ge i n germa n tv some see in the fight the beginning of a sea change in german television programming .
long the exception among european countries with its program variety for little cost , the coming digitalization of the country 's airwaves is paving the way for new money fields . companies like kabel digital deutschland are offering an ever-expanding selection of channel packages beginning at 10 euros a month .
premiere 's own successful rebound from the collapse of the leo kirch media empire in 2002 has prompted private broadcasters like rtl to launch their own pay tv channel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been used to a lot of programming , including soccer , for a small fee words of cautio n the tv landscape " is changing gradually , " said stefan weiss , an analyst for westlb . weiss co-authored a report on premiere 's bidding war that predicted the dax-listed company could get as many as 300,000 new clients if they get more bundesliga exclusivity . but experts are cautioning the dfl against showing too much willingness to compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will the fans react ?
" in the end , they also need to think of their product , " said thomas schierl , a professor at the german sport university in cologne .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .
soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2005 neo-nazi trial put on ice after upset großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel will have to wait in jail until a new trial opens - probably next year the trial of notorious holocaust-denier ernst zündel will have to be rescheduled after the judge disqualified the public defender .
she had appointed a debarred right-wing extremist as her legal assistant . on the second day of the trial against neo-nazi ernst zündel in mannheim , judge ulrich meinerzhagen announced that a new lawyer would have to be assigned to defend the 66-year old . attorney sylvia stolz had appointed horst mahler , a debarred lawyer and well-known right-wing extremist , as her legal assistant .
the judge said this was legally punishable .
he dismissed both stolz and mahler from the defense on the first day of the trial last week . meinerzhagen said a new defender would need time to prepare , which was no longer possible in the midst of the current trial .
no date for a new trial was given . zündel , who had been deported by canada to germany in march , faces charges of inciting racial hatred .
meinerzhagen said he would remain in pre-trial detention and that the trial 's collapse was entirely due to the defense team .
co n victed for right- a n d left-wi n g extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst mahler mahler spent 1970-1980 in prison after being convicted for membership in the german left-wing terrorist organization red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "

at issue : control over the internet . a nonprofit , government-funded organization located in sunny marina del rey , california is the root of a brewing conflict between the united states and europe . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , has close ties to the us department of commerce and is responsible for assigning domain names and internet suffixes - like " .com " , and " .org. "
the functions give icann far too much control over the world wide web , say critics from china , to brazil to , recently , the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icann has close ties to the commerce department " the 25 eu countries are unanimously demanding a new cooperation model for the internet , where all interested countries sit at one table to discuss the core questions of the network together , " eu commissioner for information society and media viviane reding told the magazine der spiegel this week . the power to shut off a cou n try on wednesday , the eu will present its proposal at the world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia .
the three-day conference has in the past few years tackled issues like spam e-mails and cyber-terrorism .
this year , the conflict between the us and the rest of the world on so-called " internet governance " will likely take center stage .
" we ask the eu to reconsider its new position on internet governance and work together with us to bring the benefits of the information society to all , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez wrote in a letter to the eu seen by the afp wire agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one of the root servers that direct traffic and serve as the internet 's master directories is located outside the us - in tokyo , japan twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .

though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . america i n sists o n co n trol the us says its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cites growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control .
eu officials , meanwhile , are perplexed at why the department of commerce which originally planned to withdraw from icann in 2006 , this summer decided to reverse its decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vivane reding " now the us is declaring , on short notice and unilaterally , that they insist on retaining their historic role in the political control of the net , " reding said . the eu is proposing a formula that would replace us government oversight with a purely technical intergovernmental body - though not necessarily the un - after a transition phase . feari n g bureaucracy such a body stokes fears of the kind of stifling bureaucracy the united states regularly criticizes the eu of .
rice and gutierrez 's letter says that the " burdensome , bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for so many around the globe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danger of a fractured internet : two users typing in the same web address reach different sites some fear the worst should the two sides not reach some sort of agreement .
countries refusing to accept us internet governance could set up their own domain name system , creating parallel worlds on the internet .
users typing in the same web address , for example , could reach two different sites . the real loss ? " since the positions are so polarized we may end up with a fractured internet , " said robert shaw of the un international telecommunication union , the preference of some countries to takeover oversight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 14 percent of the rest of the world is online others fear the conflict has already created a worst case scenario of some sorts .
the summit this week in tunis was supposed to tackle the internet divide between rich and poor nations .
only 14 percent of the world 's population has access to the internet compared to 62 percent in the us . the subject will most likely get pushed into the background by the struggle over internet control , say observers . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye copper wire , hello internet phone the days of phone calls being jammed down copper cables are long gone .

the ruling comes in response to us supermarket chain wal-mart 's company policy banning any sign of attraction between its workers . a court in the city of düsseldorf ruled that the german subsidiary of the world 's largest retailer , wal-mart , was acting outside the law in trying to impose restrictions on the nature of relationships allowed between its employees . the court said that while such regulations might be acceptable and indeed common practice in the us , they are neither compatible with german labor law nor the personal rights of employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart wants none of that wal-mart introduced a code of ethical conduct earlier in the year .
it prohibits company employees from dating or falling in love with a colleague in a position of influence , and from exchanging lustful glances or flirting in any way . in its 28-page code , the discount chain , requests that its workers report anyone observed to be breaking the rules , via a special telephone hotline .
failure to comply with the rules can lead to the termination of an employment contract . the ruling means that the 10,500 employees can get on with flirtation as usual without worrying about being stabbed in the back by officious colleagues . employee protectio n but gregor sobotta , personnel manager at wal-mart germany , said the company 's policy has been misunderstood . " the measures were intended to protect our employees against exertion of influence , corruption or sexual harassment in the workplace , " he said , adding that no employee should be disadvantaged on the grounds of a love match with a superior , and said that the company would deal with such situations by simply moving one of the workers concerned to a different department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart ensures its hotline callers anonymity wal-mart can officially appeal the tribunal 's ruling , but sobotta said there will be no decision on that until they have received the court 's reasons on paper .
following the ruling , however , he said he would be holding talks with the company 's workers ' council in a bid to banish fears , clear up misunderstandings , and come up with an acceptable set of rules for the protection of the workers . in defense of the hotline , to which the workers ' council has voiced opposition , the head of personnel moved to assure employees that it is totally anonymous .
he said nobody would be professionally disadvantaged as a result of using the hotline , adding that " every accusation is closely examined .

the ruling comes in response to us supermarket chain wal-mart 's company policy banning any sign of attraction between its workers . a court in the city of düsseldorf ruled that the german subsidiary of the world 's largest retailer , wal-mart , was acting outside the law in trying to impose restrictions on the nature of relationships allowed between its employees . the court said that while such regulations might be acceptable and indeed common practice in the us , they are neither compatible with german labor law nor the personal rights of employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart wants none of that wal-mart introduced a code of ethical conduct earlier in the year .
it prohibits company employees from dating or falling in love with a colleague in a position of influence , and from exchanging lustful glances or flirting in any way . in its 28-page code , the discount chain , requests that its workers report anyone observed to be breaking the rules , via a special telephone hotline .
failure to comply with the rules can lead to the termination of an employment contract . the ruling means that the 10,500 employees can get on with flirtation as usual without worrying about being stabbed in the back by officious colleagues . employee protectio n but gregor sobotta , personnel manager at wal-mart germany , said the company 's policy has been misunderstood . " the measures were intended to protect our employees against exertion of influence , corruption or sexual harassment in the workplace , " he said , adding that no employee should be disadvantaged on the grounds of a love match with a superior , and said that the company would deal with such situations by simply moving one of the workers concerned to a different department . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart ensures its hotline callers anonymity wal-mart can officially appeal the tribunal 's ruling , but sobotta said there will be no decision on that until they have received the court 's reasons on paper .
following the ruling , however , he said he would be holding talks with the company 's workers ' council in a bid to banish fears , clear up misunderstandings , and come up with an acceptable set of rules for the protection of the workers . in defense of the hotline , to which the workers ' council has voiced opposition , the head of personnel moved to assure employees that it is totally anonymous .
he said nobody would be professionally disadvantaged as a result of using the hotline , adding that " every accusation is closely examined .

the price ?
death , as one sparrow found out . for a precious few seconds , the hard work a team of domino fanatics had put into painstakingly setting up more than 4.1 million dominos looked in danger of collapsing before their eyes . a sparrow had somehow snuck into the hall where the domino team would look to break the domino world record during a show broadcast live on private german tv channel rtl this friday .
the bird knocked down 23,000 tiles and there was nothing anyone could do . after calling in an animal expert who tried unsuccessfully to catch the bird , the angry domino fans opted for heavy artillery .
a hunter took aim and shot the sparrow , ending the threat to the world record attempt .
" regrettably it was the only option , " said one of the team members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he should have stayed away from the dominos but the measure has enraged animal protectionists .
germany 's animal protection association cited animal protection laws which allow killing only on " reasonable grounds . "
a sparrow threatening a hall full of dominos apparently is n't one of them . rtl said the team did all it could before ending the bird 's life .
the world record attempt - during which the domino team will try knock down 3,992,398 of the 4,321,000 tiles set up for the event - does n't appear to be in danger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 15.11.2005 german hip hop culture in the holy land großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blumentopf : germany 's hip-hop ambassadors to the middle east sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east . blumentopf -lrb- german for flowerpot -rrb- took the stage in nazareth dressed in full jerseys from the local soccer team .
before going on they were warned , " be prepared : arabs usually do n't dance . " that soon changed , however , when they launched into their single , " macht platz . " .
buoyed by the 50 or so germans in attendance - mostly the children of german diplomats and volunteer workers - the crowd gradually moved toward the stage and picked up the flow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nice bavarian boys : kung schu , holunder , specht , master p and dj sepalot .
one of germany 's most successful and well-known hip-hop acts , blumentopf is the first german rap group to tour the middle east . a growing cultural presence marketing and advertizing for the tour is handled by germany 's goethe institute , which is spinning the tour as a kind of german cultural showcase .
blumentopf ads were plastered to the sides of city busses in nazareth and the groups lyrics are translated into arabic and passed out to the crowd at all of their shows . the goethe institute has built a growing presence in the middle east over the years , opening centers in israel , jordan , egypt , lebanon and saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute hopes the tour will spark interest in the german language " this is the first time we have used music in the middle east as a way to generate interest in the german language " , said jörg süssenbach , head of the institute 's music department .
süssenbach sees a group like blumentopf as a good way for those interested in learning more about germany to get a taste of both modern german style and perhaps also practice their german . " earlier this year we sent a jazz accordion player , manfred leuchter , but we feel that a group like blumentopf might provide some excitement as well as an opportunity for students to both practice and hear what they are learning in the classroom , " süssenbach said . hip-hop hooray another way of generating local interest in a german-speaking act like blumentopf - who are relatively unknown in places like ramallah or amman - is to showcase the group alongside local artists . blumentopf 's next stop after nazareth was the holy city of bethlehem . the concert took place at bethlehem university and was supported by two regional favorites , a palestinian rapper called " george " and female dj " mc hannan . " as a finale the five band members prepared a track together with george and mc hannan , the message of which was how terrible it feels to be locked out of a disco by a brutish bouncer .
for the palestinian kids in attendance it was a rather light metaphor for a subject they probably understand all too clearly . security walls , checkpoints and hotel bombings despite the message of goodwill and friendship that the tour set out to generate , some rather grim ' signs of the times ' could not be avoided . " nazareth seemed like a happy city , bethlehem however , was rather depressing , " one band member told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli security vehicle patrols the separation wall between israel and the palestinian territories bethlehem , unlike nazareth , is governed by the palestinian authority , which is still subject to israeli military control . a six-meter -lrb- 18-foot -rrb- high wall divides the city and permits only limited movement through security checkpoints . when the group took the stage in bethlehem it was to a relatively small group of arab and german students , most of which had eu security passes . " how can they -lrb- arab students -rrb- come ? " said george , by way of explaining the small crowd to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the israelis march in and spread fear , there are n't even any busses . "
in fact most families tend to keep their children off the streets after school . the following day , blumentopf arrived in amman , jordan . later that evening they were forced to cancel their shows in both amman and damascus and leave the region immediately after a series of deadly hotel bombings killed 57 people . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

one out of every five said it was acceptable to burp at the table .
and the same proportion considered it stupid and old-fashioned to ask permission to leave after eating or to keep elbows off the table .
half of those asked in the online questionaire said they did not put their knife and fork together when they had finished a meal .
and one in 10 said they would speak with their mouth full .
however , more modern habits remain beyond the pale - three-quarters of those asked said using mobile phones at the table was irritating .
' show respect ' simon fanshawe , author of the the done thing - negotiating the minefield of modern manners , said it was an issue which needed to be discussed more often .
he said while the survey showed a minority did not care about such things , the majority still did with many battling hard to instill good manners in their children .
" most people recognise the importance of table manners , " he said .
" all table manners flow from a sense of companionship , that we should treat other people in a such a way that they feel relaxed and happy to be there and welcomed .
" they show respect and consideration for others . "

attending were today 's business leaders who hoped to inspire and catapult future richard bransons and anita roddicks to the surface .
while established business people called for less government intervention , aspiring whiz-kids said they felt let down by the lack of encouragement in the classrooms , where too often , they said , children 's creativity was stifled .
the collective message at the start of enterprise week , however , is that without the risks that entrepreneurs are willing to take , a country 's economy will be stuck in the doldrums .
we need to nurture our future wealth gatherers .
and we need to do it now .
" entrepreneurs have never really been accepted in britain , but we 're now changing that culture , " said james braithwaite , chairman of the south east of england development agency .
' too conservative ' four people keen to be at the vanguard of that cultural shift were the winners of the bbc website 's competition to identify the qualities an entrepreneur needs , who were attending the summit .
the idea of setting up your own business was never put in your head at school paul frossell , entrepreneur " starting a business is always a challenge , having a support network is always important for business , " said one of the winners , tushar shah , 29 , from berkshire .
" if we are to foster an entrepreneurial britain we need to develop those traits from school .
we are too conservative .
when we fail it is always looked down upon .
" what we have learnt from it is more important .
in the us for example , failure is not seen as a negative , it is seen as a stepping stone . "
" the idea of setting up your own business was never put in your head at school , " agreed fellow winner paul frossell , 24 , from bedford .
business as drama spearheaded by four top uk business organisations - the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- , british chambers of commerce -lrb- bcc -rrb- , the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- and the institute of directors -lrb- iod -rrb- - events are being held across the uk .
bbc2 's controller says audiences are hungry for business last year 's inaugural enterprise week saw 1,000 events taking place .
this year the number has doubled .
funded by the dti 's small business service , enterprise insight hopes to " kick-start an enterprise culture amongst young people , " said the bcc 's director general david frost .
however , the success of tv programmes such as dragon 's den and the apprentice has shown that interest in business is growing in the uk and that the hunger to go it alone and start a company is growing .
" people can find the personal ups and down of business as gripping as fictional drama , " roly keating , controller of bbc2 told the summit .
battling red tape the world bank has identified the uk as ninth in the league of those countries where it is easiest to do business .
it 's about enabling people to take risk sir digby jones , cbi meanwhile , the number of small businesses in britain have risen by 500,000 since 1997 .
" the only limits , i believe , are people 's aspirations and their abilities , " cobra beer founder karan bilimoria told the gathering .
" we still have huge challenges .
taxation burden , public sector spending , pensions crisis , regulation from europe .
there are lots of areas of concerns . "
this was echoed by the cbi 's director-general sir digby jones , who said there was still much more work to do by the government to help would-be entrepreneurs and criticised the civil service for hampering the efforts of entrepreneurs .
" do nothing .
let enterprise flourish , " he advised ministers .
" it 's about enabling people to take risk . "
he urged the government to avoid " regulating the lifeblood of enterprise out of people . "
back to school meanwhile , the bbc news website 's four competition winners ' concerns centred more around the education system .
a reform of the way business is taught in schools was vital to inspire tomorrow 's business leaders , they said .
what makes a good entrepreneur ?
" we have an education system that is totally out of key with what we 've heard today , " said jasdeep singh bhatia , 17 , from derby .
" you leave school and nobody has even taught you about a mortgage , " added chad millington , 30 , from leigh in lancashire .
" i was born with this entrepreneurial spirit , but i could n't use it anywhere . "
they called on successful entrepreneurs to help inspire the next generation by visiting schools and colleges and explaining how they made it big .
" the best way to foster an enterprise culture in the uk is getting entrepreneurs talking to the kids of today , " said tushar shah .
" and it has to start at a young age . "

probably not .
and therein may lie its genius .
i went round the " googleplex " in silicon valley california four years after the company started .
it was unreconstructed 1960s california ; bikes in the corridors , lava lamps everywhere , the famous ex-grateful dead chef cooking delights in the google canteen , a grand piano in reception for the google phds to tinkle on during breaks .
but most impressive of all was what i saw above the reception desk : a live selection of searches being requested at that moment all over the world .
i read out a few .. and then turned to my google escort .
" no one in history has ever been able to do this before , " i said , overwhelmed by it .
" we are looking into the mind of the world . "
old hat already ?
but like all great innovations , we take things like the internet for granted as soon as we get it .
while i was there i talked to the founders of google , sergey brin and larry page .
this was before they had hired a chief executive officer - eric schmidt - and were still running the firm themselves , long before last year 's extraordinary share sale that made them multi-billionaires .
even in 2002 the company was generating enough money from ads to wipe its face .
but the founding duo was not at all clear about what the business plan actually was .
and perhaps they still do not really know .
google 's founders have brought in outside help to ponder its future even so , this has been the most extraordinary year of activity for google .
the company is mapping your desktop , managing your pictures with picasa , mapping the earth with google earth , offering search over mobile phones .
it is going local by rolling country-specific search engines , it is edging into telecoms by apparently trying to build a fibre optic network , starting up an agency to place print ads like those on its web pages , launching google talk for instant messaging and gmail for electronic mail .
more to come but it does not stop there , and google wants to make the contents of books -lrb- not just their titles -rrb- searchable to everyone -lrb- maybe eventually all the books in the world -rrb- , and it even wants to make tv programmes searchable .
in august 2005 , one year after the company 's first share flotation , google raised another $ 4billion to add to its existing $ 3billion cash pile , making it the fastest growing company ever seen .
it is taking a million square feet of nasa property in silicon valley for a new googleplex to create space for its army of phds who spend their time dreaming up ways of making search better .
it is taking floors for a huge bank of computer servers to do something with in new york .
smart farm its main asset is the number of phds it has working for it , ceaselessly trying to figure out how to extend the principle of search into everything , unbounded by time , space and -lrb- soon -rrb- language barriers .
the company mainly hires people just a year or two out of university , for fear that experience in the conventional business world will taint their freshness of mind .
google googles the internet for its own purposes , ceaselessly .
it tried to recruit a south african schoolboy i know because it was so impressed with his web page .
-lrb- he turned them down in favour of going to university , probably a mistake -rrb- .
google 's business plan seems to be a simple one : its people start things , and then work out how to make money out of them .
this is an internet land grab of extraordinary dimensions .
google wants its brand name to cover a whole host of services no wonder microsoft is worried ; no wonder wal-mart , the world 's biggest retailer , is worried .
the one feature that google has been wary of adding to its services until this month is personal search , which remembers your preferences and selects from what it thinks you will want to see .
it was quietly taken out of the labs and launched in beta form the other day and whatever the small print promises , it takes this self-proclaimed " good " company into potentially dangerous big brother territory .
but by remembering your own preferences rather than the most popular or referred-to sites , it is turning the internet into a genuinely personal resource .
a mighty move .
changing focus the google tracker and author john battelle says that google 's ultimate ambition -lrb- after it has tested the waters with its current incoherent foray into so many do-able things -rrb- is to change its overt mission statement .
at present , it professes " to organise the world 's information and make it accessible " .
the plan is to bring in the even more grandiose aim " to become the marketplace for all global commerce " .
and of course it may not be google .
google is only as good as its algorithms -lrb- though its current land grab may be an attempt to disguise that fact -rrb- .
build a better search engine than google , and the internet will beat a path to your door .
at the institute for the future in silicon valley , california , paul saffo thinks the future is yahoo , not google because yahoo has identified entertainment as the heart of its business plan .
it plans to link every other sort of internet exploration to the entertainment imperative .
out there in cyberspace , something very important is happening to all our lives .
that 's what google knows , even if it does n't know where it 's going .
work in progress is the title of this exploration of the big trends upheaving the world of work as we steam further into the 21st century ; and it is a work in progress , influenced and defined by my encounters as i report on trends in business and organisations all over the world .

it is going local by rolling country-specific search engines , it is edging into telecoms by apparently trying to build a fibre optic network , starting up an agency to place print ads like those on its web pages , launching google talk for instant messaging and gmail for electronic mail .
more to come but it does not stop there , and google wants to make the contents of books -lrb- not just their titles -rrb- searchable to everyone -lrb- maybe eventually all the books in the world -rrb- , and it even wants to make tv programmes searchable .
in august 2005 , one year after the company 's first share flotation , google raised another $ 4billion to add to its existing $ 3billion cash pile , making it the fastest growing company ever seen .
it is taking a million square feet of nasa property in silicon valley for a new googleplex to create space for its army of phds who spend their time dreaming up ways of making search better .
it is taking floors for a huge bank of computer servers to do something with in new york .
smart farm its main asset is the number of phds it has working for it , ceaselessly trying to figure out how to extend the principle of search into everything , unbounded by time , space and -lrb- soon -rrb- language barriers .
the company mainly hires people just a year or two out of university , for fear that experience in the conventional business world will taint their freshness of mind .
google googles the internet for its own purposes , ceaselessly .
it tried to recruit a south african schoolboy i know because it was so impressed with his web page .
-lrb- he turned them down in favour of going to university , probably a mistake -rrb- .
google 's business plan seems to be a simple one : its people start things , and then work out how to make money out of them .
this is an internet land grab of extraordinary dimensions .
google wants its brand name to cover a whole host of services no wonder microsoft is worried ; no wonder wal-mart , the world 's biggest retailer , is worried .
the one feature that google has been wary of adding to its services until this month is personal search , which remembers your preferences and selects from what it thinks you will want to see .
it was quietly taken out of the labs and launched in beta form the other day and whatever the small print promises , it takes this self-proclaimed " good " company into potentially dangerous big brother territory .
but by remembering your own preferences rather than the most popular or referred-to sites , it is turning the internet into a genuinely personal resource .
a mighty move .
changing focus the google tracker and author john battelle says that google 's ultimate ambition -lrb- after it has tested the waters with its current incoherent foray into so many do-able things -rrb- is to change its overt mission statement .
at present , it professes " to organise the world 's information and make it accessible " .
the plan is to bring in the even more grandiose aim " to become the marketplace for all global commerce " .
and of course it may not be google .
google is only as good as its algorithms -lrb- though its current land grab may be an attempt to disguise that fact -rrb- .
build a better search engine than google , and the internet will beat a path to your door .
at the institute for the future in silicon valley , california , paul saffo thinks the future is yahoo , not google because yahoo has identified entertainment as the heart of its business plan .
it plans to link every other sort of internet exploration to the entertainment imperative .
out there in cyberspace , something very important is happening to all our lives .
that 's what google knows , even if it does n't know where it 's going .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- us heads for internet showdown home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 15 november 2005 , 08:47 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version us heads for internet showdown by clark boyd technology correspondent in tunis world leaders , experts and campaigners are expected in tunis the us is headed for a showdown with much of the rest of the world over control of the internet at this week 's un summit in tunisia .
most net users probably do not spend a lot of time worrying about who runs the resource they are using , but there is a global battle brewing over that very question .
the internet grew out of us military and academic research , and the us government still has certain measures of control over it .
other nations , however , are clamouring for a bigger say and are pushing for significant changes at the un 's world summit on the information society .
the issue is expected to overshadow the summit , which is intended to focus on how to take the internet to less developed parts of the world .
government role most internet users around the world would agree that the internet has been functioning , technically , quite well .
it is not a monolithic entity .
in fact , it is comprised of some quarter of a million private networks that choose to interconnect with each other .
a california-based non-profit created by the clinton administration in 1998 , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- is charged with making sure that these networks talk to each other .
almost all of these things are in part the result of what happens when you get a bunch of diplomats in a room jonathan zittrain , oxford university the organisation says its job is technical , making sure that web addresses take surfers to the right site .
what icann does not do is " run " or " control " the internet , according to theresa swinehart , general manager for global partnerships at icann .
" actually , nobody runs or controls the internet single-handedly .
it is multiple parties , multiple businesses , users , and networks connecting to this .
all these different groups , organizations and companies have a responsibility . "
but icann operates under a memorandum of understanding with the us department of commerce .
to some , that looks like american control of the internet .
" the rest of the world does n't want to see us hegemony here , in large part just for symbolic reasons , " says jonathan zittrain , chair in internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
" so there 's one set of countries , anchored by iran , cuba and china , that would like to see some process by which governments of the world have a much larger hand in controlling the shape of the internet . "
many african politicians are also asking for " regime change " on the internet , and the european union called in september for a new , international body to govern the net .
us stands firm but the bush administration and many in the us congress reject the idea .
we do n't see any advantage in moving toward un control .
we just feel it would be bureaucratically heavy and frankly , unnecessary bill graham , canadian government both the us departments of commerce and state have reiterated that the us will maintain what they call " stewardship " of the internet .
they contend that the us , working with icann , is best placed to ensure an open , secure and stable online environment .
and in a recent letter to the wall street journal , republican senator norm coleman wrote : " there is no rational justification for politicising internet governance within a united nations framework . "
that view has plenty of support outside the us .
" we do n't see any advantage in moving toward un control , " says bill graham , who works on internet governance issues for the canadian government .
" in fact , we 're on record as opposing that .
we just feel it would be bureaucratically heavy and frankly , unnecessary . "
mr graham supports a compromise measure , some kind of international forum that would have no oversight duties , but would help other nations feel like they have more input into how the internet functions .
at risk some in the anti-us camp are threatening more drastic action .
they say , if the us wo n't cede some control , they will create their own internet .
michael geist , who teaches internet law at the university of ottawa , says that a world of multiple " internets " might not be a good thing .
" what 's at risk is the possibility that the communications system of the internet that we 've come to rely upon , the ability for me to send an electronic message anywhere around the world , and similarly access websites around the world , and have little doubt that my requests will be recognised , is put in some measure of peril by the fact that we might have several different internets , " he said .
the un summit is due to look at ways of getting more people online few think this will actually happen , but the threat will be there as politicians and technocrats from across the globe meet in tunisia from this week .
special preparatory meetings to address the internet governance issue are under way ahead of the summit 's official start on wednesday .
" it 's a political battle where , i think it was henry kissinger who once said , ' the fighting is so fierce , precisely because the stakes are so small ' , " says oxford 's jonathan zittrain .

most net users probably do not spend a lot of time worrying about who runs the resource they are using , but there is a global battle brewing over that very question .
the internet grew out of us military and academic research , and the us government still has certain measures of control over it .
other nations , however , are clamouring for a bigger say and are pushing for significant changes at the un 's world summit on the information society .
the issue is expected to overshadow the summit , which is intended to focus on how to take the internet to less developed parts of the world .
government role most internet users around the world would agree that the internet has been functioning , technically , quite well .
it is not a monolithic entity .
in fact , it is comprised of some quarter of a million private networks that choose to interconnect with each other .
a california-based non-profit created by the clinton administration in 1998 , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- is charged with making sure that these networks talk to each other .
almost all of these things are in part the result of what happens when you get a bunch of diplomats in a room jonathan zittrain , oxford university the organisation says its job is technical , making sure that web addresses take surfers to the right site .
what icann does not do is " run " or " control " the internet , according to theresa swinehart , general manager for global partnerships at icann .
" actually , nobody runs or controls the internet single-handedly .
it is multiple parties , multiple businesses , users , and networks connecting to this .
all these different groups , organizations and companies have a responsibility . "
but icann operates under a memorandum of understanding with the us department of commerce .
to some , that looks like american control of the internet .
" the rest of the world does n't want to see us hegemony here , in large part just for symbolic reasons , " says jonathan zittrain , chair in internet governance and regulation at oxford university .
" so there 's one set of countries , anchored by iran , cuba and china , that would like to see some process by which governments of the world have a much larger hand in controlling the shape of the internet . "
many african politicians are also asking for " regime change " on the internet , and the european union called in september for a new , international body to govern the net .
us stands firm but the bush administration and many in the us congress reject the idea .
we do n't see any advantage in moving toward un control .
we just feel it would be bureaucratically heavy and frankly , unnecessary bill graham , canadian government both the us departments of commerce and state have reiterated that the us will maintain what they call " stewardship " of the internet .
they contend that the us , working with icann , is best placed to ensure an open , secure and stable online environment .
and in a recent letter to the wall street journal , republican senator norm coleman wrote : " there is no rational justification for politicising internet governance within a united nations framework . "
that view has plenty of support outside the us .
" we do n't see any advantage in moving toward un control , " says bill graham , who works on internet governance issues for the canadian government .
" in fact , we 're on record as opposing that .
we just feel it would be bureaucratically heavy and frankly , unnecessary . "
mr graham supports a compromise measure , some kind of international forum that would have no oversight duties , but would help other nations feel like they have more input into how the internet functions .
at risk some in the anti-us camp are threatening more drastic action .
they say , if the us wo n't cede some control , they will create their own internet .
michael geist , who teaches internet law at the university of ottawa , says that a world of multiple " internets " might not be a good thing .
" what 's at risk is the possibility that the communications system of the internet that we 've come to rely upon , the ability for me to send an electronic message anywhere around the world , and similarly access websites around the world , and have little doubt that my requests will be recognised , is put in some measure of peril by the fact that we might have several different internets , " he said .
the un summit is due to look at ways of getting more people online few think this will actually happen , but the threat will be there as politicians and technocrats from across the globe meet in tunisia from this week .
special preparatory meetings to address the internet governance issue are under way ahead of the summit 's official start on wednesday .
" it 's a political battle where , i think it was henry kissinger who once said , ' the fighting is so fierce , precisely because the stakes are so small ' , " says oxford 's jonathan zittrain .
" almost all of these things are in part the result of what happens when you get a bunch of diplomats in a room .

most net users probably do not spend a lot of time worrying about who runs the resource they are using , but there is a global battle brewing over that very question .
the internet grew out of us military and academic research , and the us government still has certain measures of control over it .
other nations , however , are clamouring for a bigger say and are pushing for significant changes at the un 's world summit on the information society .
the issue is expected to overshadow the summit , which is intended to focus on how to take the internet to less developed parts of the world .
government role most internet users around the world would agree that the internet has been functioning , technically , quite well .
it is not a monolithic entity .
in fact , it is comprised of some quarter of a million private networks that choose to interconnect with each other .
a california-based non-profit created by the clinton administration in 1998 , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- is charged with making sure that these networks talk to each other .

what icann does not do is " run " or " control " the internet , according to theresa swinehart , general manager for global partnerships at icann .
" actually , nobody runs or controls the internet single-handedly .
it is multiple parties , multiple businesses , users , and networks connecting to this .
