but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .

the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 a new way to explore the seas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rougerie made his name with underwater and space craft designs it has to be one of the weirder crafts to grace a drawing board - a seahorse-shaped buoy , 51 meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- tall , designed not for transport , but to drift around the oceans studying life beneath the waves . the strange vessel goes by the name of seaorbiter , and it is the vision of french marine architect jacques rougerie , whose has for decades designed underwater houses and built futuristic ships with transparent hulls . " seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .

" recent weeks have seen an escalation in tension between -lrb- the two main ethnic albanian political parties -rrb- so bitter that it risks spiraling into killings , " the report said . return to instability a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina without a " great deal " more effort from the international community , " kosovo is likely to return to instability ... and again put at risk all that has been invested in building a european future for the western balkans " . it said unmik , which has administered the province since nato intervened to end the conflict , had been in a " six-year holding pattern " in which it had turned a blind eye to major challenges to democracy and the rule of law .
" rather than state-building , unmik is now mainly working on its own escape strategy , passing on unresolved problems that will haunt kosovo for years to come , " said icg kosovo project director alex anderson .
" corruption is being transferred intact .

" unmik is devoting most of its energy to producing a sufficiently convincing facade ... to allow kosovo to pass the test that will open the final status process , " it said . " that facade does include some genuine progress and solid work , but it does not represent the comprehensive effort needed for democratic practices to take root . " ethnic tensions ready to explode once more kosovo remains technically part of serbia but its ethnic albanian majority demands complete independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj the icg said the un war crimes tribunal at the hague should consider granting bail to indicted former kosovo albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj , accused of rape and other atrocities , in order to calm mounting tensions in the province .
" kosovo albanians ' present peace with the international community is highly conditional ... " it warned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 german , spanish leaders campaign for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on the stump in france with opinion polls showing the " no " camp in front days before the vote , the two left-wing european leaders targeted generally pro-european socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters in france , seen as the key to the outcome . german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero joined the last day of campaigning for the french referendum on the eu constitution friday in a bid to convince skeptical swing voters to approve the treaty . " spain votes ' yes ' , france votes ' yes ' and europe votes ' yes ' , " zapatero told a rally hosted by socialist party leader francois hollande that was attended by about 3,000 people in the northern city of lille . " europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .
" the ' no ' is sad and pessimistic , " he added .
" we want europe because it means peace , freedom and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero holds his ballot in a polling station in las rozas on the outskirts of madrid , sunday , feb .
20 , 2005 as spaniards started voting on it in the referendum to ratify the eu constitution .
zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules . " great responsibility " after germany became the ninth country to ratify the eu charter on friday , schröder addressed a rally of between 700 and 800 people for the " yes " campaign in the southwestern city of toulouse alongside former french minister dominique strauss-kahn . schröder asked the french to " vote ' yes ' with all their heart and their head . "
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .
he called on france not to derail the european project by voting " no " . " the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart that the french are going to ratify this constitution through a referendum , " giscard d 'estaing said .
" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " . " europe is stronger when it speaks with one voice .

" spain votes ' yes ' , france votes ' yes ' and europe votes ' yes ' , " zapatero told a rally hosted by socialist party leader francois hollande that was attended by about 3,000 people in the northern city of lille . " europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .

zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules . " great responsibility " after germany became the ninth country to ratify the eu charter on friday , schröder addressed a rally of between 700 and 800 people for the " yes " campaign in the southwestern city of toulouse alongside former french minister dominique strauss-kahn . schröder asked the french to " vote ' yes ' with all their heart and their head . "
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .
he called on france not to derail the european project by voting " no " . " the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart that the french are going to ratify this constitution through a referendum , " giscard d 'estaing said .
" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 german , spanish leaders campaign for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on the stump in france with opinion polls showing the " no " camp in front days before the vote , the two left-wing european leaders targeted generally pro-european socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters in france , seen as the key to the outcome . german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero joined the last day of campaigning for the french referendum on the eu constitution friday in a bid to convince skeptical swing voters to approve the treaty . " spain votes ' yes ' , france votes ' yes ' and europe votes ' yes ' , " zapatero told a rally hosted by socialist party leader francois hollande that was attended by about 3,000 people in the northern city of lille . " europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .
" the ' no ' is sad and pessimistic , " he added .
" we want europe because it means peace , freedom and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero holds his ballot in a polling station in las rozas on the outskirts of madrid , sunday , feb .
20 , 2005 as spaniards started voting on it in the referendum to ratify the eu constitution .
zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules . " great responsibility " after germany became the ninth country to ratify the eu charter on friday , schröder addressed a rally of between 700 and 800 people for the " yes " campaign in the southwestern city of toulouse alongside former french minister dominique strauss-kahn . schröder asked the french to " vote ' yes ' with all their heart and their head . "
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .
he called on france not to derail the european project by voting " no " . " the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart that the french are going to ratify this constitution through a referendum , " giscard d 'estaing said .
" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " . " europe is stronger when it speaks with one voice .
we need a strong europe , an integrated europe , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in france in april lending his support the french governement 's campaign for the " yes " to the constitution .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie . " i want to make dreams come alive , but only if these dreams have a purpose for human development , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the weird and wacky wow geneva the 33rd international exhibition of inventions in geneva has ended and while the motives of many were fame and fortune as inventors searched out investors , some were just there to make visitors go wow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 schröder 's election strategy hits a snag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strategy seemed sound at the outset , but is now problematic chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?
-lrb- may 23 , 2005 -rrb- early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 a new way to explore the seas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rougerie made his name with underwater and space craft designs it has to be one of the weirder crafts to grace a drawing board - a seahorse-shaped buoy , 51 meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- tall , designed not for transport , but to drift around the oceans studying life beneath the waves . the strange vessel goes by the name of seaorbiter , and it is the vision of french marine architect jacques rougerie , whose has for decades designed underwater houses and built futuristic ships with transparent hulls . " seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie . " i want to make dreams come alive , but only if these dreams have a purpose for human development , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the weird and wacky wow geneva the 33rd international exhibition of inventions in geneva has ended and while the motives of many were fame and fortune as inventors searched out investors , some were just there to make visitors go wow .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .

tough luck for schalke - they finish second in the bundesliga behind bayern and also lose the the german cup final to bayern .
congratulations to bayern and felix magath , who in his first season as bayern coach has managed to win the double .
the last coach to win the double in his maiden season at bayern was croatian branco zebec back in 1969 when his bayern side also defeated schalke in the final .
it was a match in which bayern were clearly the better side .
they missed three clear chances in the first half and were unlucky to have a goal disallowed for an offsides penalty .
roy mackay put the bundesliga champions ahead in the 42nd minute .
brazilian lincoln equalized for schalke with a hotly disputed penalty on the stroke of half time .
substitute hasan salihamidic came on to score bayern 's winner in the 76th minute . however , television replays showed the he was clearly offsides when fed by roy makaay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's brazilian ailton all in all , there can be no complaints from schalke though and their fans were celebrating at the end of the game as if their side had won .
schalke 's brazilian superstar ailton will be disappointed though .
somehow this match was symptomatic for his season .
ailton was substituted and will be thinking back nostalgically to this time last year when he clinched the double with his former club werder bremen in the very same olympic stadium .
it was a good season for schalke , despite finishing without any silverware .
their coach , ralf rangnick , was philosophical .
" we went from 15th to second and were in first place for a number of weeks , " he said .
" we 're clearly the number two team behind bayern and it was a great season . "
bayern coach felix magath agreed .
" we played consistent football at a high level all season .
and at the end of the season we showed we were able to play an entire season like that . "
bayern won the bundesliga with 77 points from 34 matches ahead of schalke who finished as the runner-up with 63 points . the renovated berlin olympic stadium will host the world cup final next year . alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 german , spanish leaders campaign for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on the stump in france with opinion polls showing the " no " camp in front days before the vote , the two left-wing european leaders targeted generally pro-european socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters in france , seen as the key to the outcome . german chancellor gerhard schröder and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero joined the last day of campaigning for the french referendum on the eu constitution friday in a bid to convince skeptical swing voters to approve the treaty . " spain votes ' yes ' , france votes ' yes ' and europe votes ' yes ' , " zapatero told a rally hosted by socialist party leader francois hollande that was attended by about 3,000 people in the northern city of lille . " europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .
" the ' no ' is sad and pessimistic , " he added .
" we want europe because it means peace , freedom and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero holds his ballot in a polling station in las rozas on the outskirts of madrid , sunday , feb .
20 , 2005 as spaniards started voting on it in the referendum to ratify the eu constitution .
zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules . " great responsibility " after germany became the ninth country to ratify the eu charter on friday , schröder addressed a rally of between 700 and 800 people for the " yes " campaign in the southwestern city of toulouse alongside former french minister dominique strauss-kahn . schröder asked the french to " vote ' yes ' with all their heart and their head . "
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .
he called on france not to derail the european project by voting " no " . " the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart that the french are going to ratify this constitution through a referendum , " giscard d 'estaing said .
" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " . " europe is stronger when it speaks with one voice .
we need a strong europe , an integrated europe , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in france in april lending his support the french governement 's campaign for the " yes " to the constitution .

" europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .

zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules .

"
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .

" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

congratulations to bayern and felix magath , who in his first season as bayern coach has managed to win the double .
the last coach to win the double in his maiden season at bayern was croatian branco zebec back in 1969 when his bayern side also defeated schalke in the final .

zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules .

"

" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 schröder 's election strategy hits a snag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strategy seemed sound at the outset , but is now problematic chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .

" rather than state-building , unmik is now mainly working on its own escape strategy , passing on unresolved problems that will haunt kosovo for years to come , " said icg kosovo project director alex anderson .
" corruption is being transferred intact .

" administration maintaining a cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peace is a fragile one in kosovo despite un efforts it said the un had been coddling ethnic albanian politicians to the point of denying the existence of rival " party intelligence structures " which threatened to erupt into unrest as soon as the un washed its hands of the province .
" unmik is devoting most of its energy to producing a sufficiently convincing facade ... to allow kosovo to pass the test that will open the final status process , " it said . " that facade does include some genuine progress and solid work , but it does not represent the comprehensive effort needed for democratic practices to take root . " ethnic tensions ready to explode once more kosovo remains technically part of serbia but its ethnic albanian majority demands complete independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj the icg said the un war crimes tribunal at the hague should consider granting bail to indicted former kosovo albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj , accused of rape and other atrocities , in order to calm mounting tensions in the province .
" kosovo albanians ' present peace with the international community is highly conditional ... " it warned .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?

" recent weeks have seen an escalation in tension between -lrb- the two main ethnic albanian political parties -rrb- so bitter that it risks spiraling into killings , " the report said . return to instability a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina without a " great deal " more effort from the international community , " kosovo is likely to return to instability ... and again put at risk all that has been invested in building a european future for the western balkans " . it said unmik , which has administered the province since nato intervened to end the conflict , had been in a " six-year holding pattern " in which it had turned a blind eye to major challenges to democracy and the rule of law .
" rather than state-building , unmik is now mainly working on its own escape strategy , passing on unresolved problems that will haunt kosovo for years to come , " said icg kosovo project director alex anderson .
" corruption is being transferred intact . " the report said : " problems that will come back to haunt kosovo , like tolerance of widespread corruption and of powerful , unaccountable partisan political intelligence agencies , are being swept under the carpet rather than addressed . " administration maintaining a cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peace is a fragile one in kosovo despite un efforts it said the un had been coddling ethnic albanian politicians to the point of denying the existence of rival " party intelligence structures " which threatened to erupt into unrest as soon as the un washed its hands of the province .
" unmik is devoting most of its energy to producing a sufficiently convincing facade ... to allow kosovo to pass the test that will open the final status process , " it said . " that facade does include some genuine progress and solid work , but it does not represent the comprehensive effort needed for democratic practices to take root . " ethnic tensions ready to explode once more kosovo remains technically part of serbia but its ethnic albanian majority demands complete independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj the icg said the un war crimes tribunal at the hague should consider granting bail to indicted former kosovo albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj , accused of rape and other atrocities , in order to calm mounting tensions in the province .
" kosovo albanians ' present peace with the international community is highly conditional ... " it warned . " most areas are calm , but haradinaj 's home municipality of decan is a tinderbox , full of angry armed groups , and isolated from the rest of kosovo .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .

powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie .

tough luck for schalke - they finish second in the bundesliga behind bayern and also lose the the german cup final to bayern .
congratulations to bayern and felix magath , who in his first season as bayern coach has managed to win the double .
the last coach to win the double in his maiden season at bayern was croatian branco zebec back in 1969 when his bayern side also defeated schalke in the final .
it was a match in which bayern were clearly the better side .
they missed three clear chances in the first half and were unlucky to have a goal disallowed for an offsides penalty .
roy mackay put the bundesliga champions ahead in the 42nd minute .
brazilian lincoln equalized for schalke with a hotly disputed penalty on the stroke of half time .
substitute hasan salihamidic came on to score bayern 's winner in the 76th minute . however , television replays showed the he was clearly offsides when fed by roy makaay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's brazilian ailton all in all , there can be no complaints from schalke though and their fans were celebrating at the end of the game as if their side had won .
schalke 's brazilian superstar ailton will be disappointed though .
somehow this match was symptomatic for his season .
ailton was substituted and will be thinking back nostalgically to this time last year when he clinched the double with his former club werder bremen in the very same olympic stadium .
it was a good season for schalke , despite finishing without any silverware .
their coach , ralf rangnick , was philosophical .
" we went from 15th to second and were in first place for a number of weeks , " he said .
" we 're clearly the number two team behind bayern and it was a great season . "
bayern coach felix magath agreed .
" we played consistent football at a high level all season .
and at the end of the season we showed we were able to play an entire season like that . "
bayern won the bundesliga with 77 points from 34 matches ahead of schalke who finished as the runner-up with 63 points . the renovated berlin olympic stadium will host the world cup final next year . alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit reporter we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .

she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .

tough luck for schalke - they finish second in the bundesliga behind bayern and also lose the the german cup final to bayern .
congratulations to bayern and felix magath , who in his first season as bayern coach has managed to win the double .
the last coach to win the double in his maiden season at bayern was croatian branco zebec back in 1969 when his bayern side also defeated schalke in the final .
it was a match in which bayern were clearly the better side .
they missed three clear chances in the first half and were unlucky to have a goal disallowed for an offsides penalty .

ailton was substituted and will be thinking back nostalgically to this time last year when he clinched the double with his former club werder bremen in the very same olympic stadium .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by .

powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 a new way to explore the seas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rougerie made his name with underwater and space craft designs it has to be one of the weirder crafts to grace a drawing board - a seahorse-shaped buoy , 51 meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- tall , designed not for transport , but to drift around the oceans studying life beneath the waves . the strange vessel goes by the name of seaorbiter , and it is the vision of french marine architect jacques rougerie , whose has for decades designed underwater houses and built futuristic ships with transparent hulls . " seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .

rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 schröder 's election strategy hits a snag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strategy seemed sound at the outset , but is now problematic chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?

the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by .

powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 a new way to explore the seas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rougerie made his name with underwater and space craft designs it has to be one of the weirder crafts to grace a drawing board - a seahorse-shaped buoy , 51 meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- tall , designed not for transport , but to drift around the oceans studying life beneath the waves . the strange vessel goes by the name of seaorbiter , and it is the vision of french marine architect jacques rougerie , whose has for decades designed underwater houses and built futuristic ships with transparent hulls . " seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment .

zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules .

rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .

" recent weeks have seen an escalation in tension between -lrb- the two main ethnic albanian political parties -rrb- so bitter that it risks spiraling into killings , " the report said . return to instability a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina without a " great deal " more effort from the international community , " kosovo is likely to return to instability ... and again put at risk all that has been invested in building a european future for the western balkans " . it said unmik , which has administered the province since nato intervened to end the conflict , had been in a " six-year holding pattern " in which it had turned a blind eye to major challenges to democracy and the rule of law .
" rather than state-building , unmik is now mainly working on its own escape strategy , passing on unresolved problems that will haunt kosovo for years to come , " said icg kosovo project director alex anderson .
" corruption is being transferred intact . " the report said : " problems that will come back to haunt kosovo , like tolerance of widespread corruption and of powerful , unaccountable partisan political intelligence agencies , are being swept under the carpet rather than addressed . " administration maintaining a cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peace is a fragile one in kosovo despite un efforts it said the un had been coddling ethnic albanian politicians to the point of denying the existence of rival " party intelligence structures " which threatened to erupt into unrest as soon as the un washed its hands of the province .
" unmik is devoting most of its energy to producing a sufficiently convincing facade ... to allow kosovo to pass the test that will open the final status process , " it said . " that facade does include some genuine progress and solid work , but it does not represent the comprehensive effort needed for democratic practices to take root . " ethnic tensions ready to explode once more kosovo remains technically part of serbia but its ethnic albanian majority demands complete independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj the icg said the un war crimes tribunal at the hague should consider granting bail to indicted former kosovo albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj , accused of rape and other atrocities , in order to calm mounting tensions in the province .
" kosovo albanians ' present peace with the international community is highly conditional ... " it warned . " most areas are calm , but haradinaj 's home municipality of decan is a tinderbox , full of angry armed groups , and isolated from the rest of kosovo .

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie .

" europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .

20 , 2005 as spaniards started voting on it in the referendum to ratify the eu constitution .
zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules .

"
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .

" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " .

we need a strong europe , an integrated europe , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in france in april lending his support the french governement 's campaign for the " yes " to the constitution .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .

" recent weeks have seen an escalation in tension between -lrb- the two main ethnic albanian political parties -rrb- so bitter that it risks spiraling into killings , " the report said . return to instability a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kosovo police officer stands guard near damaged cars and apartments in a mainly serb neighborhood in the kosovo capital pristina without a " great deal " more effort from the international community , " kosovo is likely to return to instability ... and again put at risk all that has been invested in building a european future for the western balkans " . it said unmik , which has administered the province since nato intervened to end the conflict , had been in a " six-year holding pattern " in which it had turned a blind eye to major challenges to democracy and the rule of law .
" rather than state-building , unmik is now mainly working on its own escape strategy , passing on unresolved problems that will haunt kosovo for years to come , " said icg kosovo project director alex anderson .
" corruption is being transferred intact . " the report said : " problems that will come back to haunt kosovo , like tolerance of widespread corruption and of powerful , unaccountable partisan political intelligence agencies , are being swept under the carpet rather than addressed . " administration maintaining a cover-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peace is a fragile one in kosovo despite un efforts it said the un had been coddling ethnic albanian politicians to the point of denying the existence of rival " party intelligence structures " which threatened to erupt into unrest as soon as the un washed its hands of the province .
" unmik is devoting most of its energy to producing a sufficiently convincing facade ... to allow kosovo to pass the test that will open the final status process , " it said . " that facade does include some genuine progress and solid work , but it does not represent the comprehensive effort needed for democratic practices to take root . " ethnic tensions ready to explode once more kosovo remains technically part of serbia but its ethnic albanian majority demands complete independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj the icg said the un war crimes tribunal at the hague should consider granting bail to indicted former kosovo albanian prime minister ramush haradinaj , accused of rape and other atrocities , in order to calm mounting tensions in the province .
" kosovo albanians ' present peace with the international community is highly conditional ... " it warned . " most areas are calm , but haradinaj 's home municipality of decan is a tinderbox , full of angry armed groups , and isolated from the rest of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 schröder 's election strategy hits a snag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strategy seemed sound at the outset , but is now problematic chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

" seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by .

powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment .

" spain votes ' yes ' , france votes ' yes ' and europe votes ' yes ' , " zapatero told a rally hosted by socialist party leader francois hollande that was attended by about 3,000 people in the northern city of lille . " europe needs france , its enthusiasm , its culture , its strength and its momentum , " he said , adding that europe would not make progress without france .
" the ' no ' is sad and pessimistic , " he added .
" we want europe because it means peace , freedom and solidarity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero holds his ballot in a polling station in las rozas on the outskirts of madrid , sunday , feb .
20 , 2005 as spaniards started voting on it in the referendum to ratify the eu constitution .
zapatero was returning a favor to french president jacques chirac , who visited barcelona in february to back the " yes " camp ahead of the spanish referendum . european union leaders are increasingly worried that a rejection of the treaty in sunday 's referendum in france will deal a bitter blow to the bloc 's first constitution , aimed at simplifying eu operating rules . " great responsibility " after germany became the ninth country to ratify the eu charter on friday , schröder addressed a rally of between 700 and 800 people for the " yes " campaign in the southwestern city of toulouse alongside former french minister dominique strauss-kahn . schröder asked the french to " vote ' yes ' with all their heart and their head . "
france and germany have a great responsibility for europe to last eternally and must assume that responsibility for future generations , schröder said . spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the eu constitution on february 20 and those voting backed it overwhelmingly , a sharp contrast to a more skeptical france . left is divided france 's opposition socialists are deeply split on the eu constitution , with the party leadership backing the text and dissidents led by former prime minister laurent fabius opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , who oversaw the process of drawing up the constitution , defended the treaty in an address to germany 's upper house earlier in the day .
he called on france not to derail the european project by voting " no " . " the day after tomorrow , i hope with all my heart that the french are going to ratify this constitution through a referendum , " giscard d 'estaing said .
" ratification by germany and france would mark an historic step forward for the future of the constitution and for europe . " by completing the ratification process , germany followed in the footsteps of austria , greece , hungary , italy , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia and spain . all 25 eu member states must approve the constitutional text before it can take effect .
rejection by france , one of the bloc 's six founding members , would likely plunge the european union into political uncertainty . in wake of domestic defeat schröder 's visit to france came at a difficult time for him politically , after he called for an early general election following a key state election defeat for his social democrats , but german support for the constitution is strong . both schröder and former chancellor helmut schmidt have made urgent appeals to the french to back the constitution , with schröder warning france last week " not to leave the other europeans in the lurch " . " europe is stronger when it speaks with one voice .
we need a strong europe , an integrated europe , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in france in april lending his support the french governement 's campaign for the " yes " to the constitution .
german foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile has hailed the constitution as a " fantastic project " which would allow europe to face up to an increasingly globalized world . earlier this week , zapatero called on french voters to back the treaty , saying it would " facilitate construction of our social model , without doubt the best and fairest in the world .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter .

" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .

it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights . " i am not for regulating sex work , i am for recognizing rights to sex workers which is not the same , " she said .
" i do not want to give power to the owners of clubs . " that is , sex clubs run by those who exploit prostitutes for money , such as pimps , should n't have their trade receive legal status , she thinks . sexual abuse but silvia cuerdas of the spanish feminist party believes that legalizing prostitution is the same as legalizing sexual abuse . " in this society we are talking about eradicating sexual harassment at work or at home , the problem of domestic violence , " she said .
" so we ca n't legalize a practice where all those things happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuerdas says that statistics show that only five percent of prostitutes are willingly practicing their trade and the rest have been forced into it . she wants women who are prostitutes to be given better work options and thinks a model like that in sweden - prosecuting pimps and clients of prostitutes - would work in spain . prostitutes think otherwise but several prostitutes at the conference did not agree .
carolina , from equador , has worked on the street as a prostitute for eight years .
she wants to be able to work without interference from the police or social discrimination .
she says it is time the government acted to give her the same rights as other workers . her colleague , joanna , also at the conference , insisted that the majority of prostitutes she knows are in the business of their own accord .
she said that she is her own boss . but many feminists argue that this is n't a view that represents the majority of prostitutes . they say that if these women really had other options , they would choose other professions . at the moment spain 's government is n't taking a position in this contentious debate .
but with prostitutes backed by feminist groups and powerful labor unions demanding action , the government is coming under increasing pressure to take action sooner rather than later . danny wood -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2005 a new way to explore the seas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rougerie made his name with underwater and space craft designs it has to be one of the weirder crafts to grace a drawing board - a seahorse-shaped buoy , 51 meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- tall , designed not for transport , but to drift around the oceans studying life beneath the waves . the strange vessel goes by the name of seaorbiter , and it is the vision of french marine architect jacques rougerie , whose has for decades designed underwater houses and built futuristic ships with transparent hulls . " seaorbiter will be a different way of approaching the underwater world , a human adventure , an explorer 's adventure , " rougerie told afp . sea covers two-thirds of the globe , yet it is still the least understood dimension on the world 's surface , both in its topography and in the many species that have yet to be discovered or described .
the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .
it can be used day and night , and whales , dolphins and other sea creatures , undisturbed by engines or artificial movement , are likely to congregate close by . " if you see something interesting , all you have to do is to get suited up , quietly open an airlock and swim outside to take a look , " the inventor said .
from the depths and the heavens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not yet built : rougerie 's seaorbiter the plans show seaorbiter to be extraordinarily tall and thin , stabilized by a gigantic circular keel and driven , when need be , by electric engines .
like an iceberg , most of it is beneath the waves .
it is just 10 meters -lrb- 32.5 feet -rrb- wide and 31 meters -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- of its 51 vertical meters -lrb- 165 feet -rrb- are submerged .
the bottom levels are studded with windows and have a pressurized section for eight scientists , complete with laboratories .
powerful lights will illuminate the ocean beneath the ship , and remote-controlled robot scouts can be sent down to explore depths of up to 600 meters -lrb- 1,950 feet -rrb- . rougerie said that the scheme has met enthusiastic responses from many scientists , including nasa , whose interest lies in astronaut training . " on seaorbiter , there would be a training section , including a kitchen and cabin-cum-bedroom , where astronauts would live as a team in a confined space , in a configuration broadly similar to that of a space capsule .
in addition , going out of the ship and underwater is rather like going into space , because the movements and ergonomics are somewhat similar , " rougerie said .
the usual sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astronauts could train in the seaorbiter there is just one fly in the ointment , though - and it 's a big one : money .
rougerie estimates that seaorbiter will cost 25 million euros -lrb- $ 31.25 million -rrb- to build , and is beating the drum to get corporate partners , sponsors , public institutions and wealthy dreamers on board .
the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .
the device successfully coped with 15-meter-high -lrb- 48.75-feet-high -rrb- waves . if the money rolls in , seaorbiter could be built by 2008 , with the atlantic 's gulf stream sketched as the first mission , according to rougerie .

but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma . gerhard schröder has to lose the confidence vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , in order for new elections to be held , likely in september .
he unveiled that plan , to the surprise of almost everyone , after his social democratic party suffered a humiliating defeat in the state election in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
the no confidence vote must be tied either to schroeder 's own position as chancellor or to a specific policy of his government - and that is where the difficulty lies . if it is turned into a personal referendum on schröder 's leadership , if he does lose the vote , which is the strategy , schroeder would have trouble justifying his own candidacy in the resulting election battle against likely conservative challenger angela merkel , and give the opposition additional ammunition . plan b also delicate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german bundestag the alternative , which is to tie the bundestag vote to a major policy initiative his government can not push through , such as a stalled corporate tax cut , is now also proving a delicate matter . " from a political point of view , given his string of defeats in state elections , schröder has good reason to call for a no confidence vote , " andreas falke , a political scientist at erlangen - nuremberg university , told reuters .
" but from a purely legalistic standpoint it is difficult for schröder to find the basis for this vote . " the idea to link it to the tax cut by saying it has been blocked by schröder 's own coalition members , the greens , has sparked a fierce response by members of the environmentalist party .
the greens agreed to the cut when it was unveiled in march , but have had differences with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- over financing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krista sager , right " we will not be made scapegoats for the no confidence vote , " said krista sager , greens leader in the bundestag .
another party member , werner schulz , has vowed legal action if schröder used " tricks " to get his no confidence vote through parliament . in calling for an early election even though opinion polls give merkel 's conservatives a 15-21 point lead , analysts believe he was seeking to avoid an embarrassing rebellion by leftists within his own party and to catch the opposition off-guard . but if the greens and rebel leftist members of his own party do n't play along , schroeder may have a problem . change to constitution ? in a sign of how serious the issue has become , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on saturday that his allies were contemplating changes to the constitution to ensure the election goes ahead . the paper reported that schröder 's supporters are seeking to change the constitution to allow the lower house of parliament to dissolve itself ahead of planned early elections .
quoting sources close to the sdp , the paper said the change , which has to be approved by two-thirds of both houses , could be pushed through within four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler at present germany 's president horst köhler has the role of dissolving parliament , but legal experts say such a political move does not sit well with his honorific position . however the parliamentary leader of the spd 's coalition partner , the greens , krista sager , said in a radio interview saturday she was against changing the basic law " for the needs of the moment . " designed with the lessons of the unstable pre-nazi weimar republic in mind , the constitution does not allow for the government to dissolve parliament unilaterally and force new elections . government sources told reuters that schröder 's spd and their greens partners would meet on tuesday to discuss a way out of the impasse .
schröder has demanded a solution on the no confidence vote by the end of the week , newspapers said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?

the conventional way of examining life beneath the waves - by scuba or submarine - is usually brief , uncomfortable and intrusive . rougerie 's idea is that a drifting vessel , with viewing ports deep beneath sea level , is far smarter .

the biggest names he has lured so far include two major engineering companies , comex and vinci . so far , seaorbiter exists in physical form only as a 3.5-meter -lrb- 10-feet -rrb- model , which has just finished six-month trials in europe 's biggest wave tank to test it for stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.05.2005 calls in spain to legalize prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in spain want to give them new rights one of spain 's largest trade unions wants the government to regulate prostitution and grant prostitutes labor rights like other workers .
it 's a divisive issue , with feminists and prostitutes on both sides of the debate . there are up to 400,000 women working in the sex trade in spain .
according to the union comisiones obreras over ninety percent are immigrants .
the supporters of new regulation around the sex industry argue that most prostitutes work in virtual slavery and deserve basic rights and protection . but the issue of how to deal with prostitution divides feminists , social workers and governments all over europe .
here in spain , prostitution is n't illegal , but nor is it legal .
in germany , sex workers do have legal rights , while in sweden rather than prosecuting prostitutes , authorities pursue those who employ prostitutes and the clients who use them . the issue is a hot topic in spain now , not least because it is tied up with europe 's illegal immigration problem . changing face of prostitution at a conference in spain called workers rights in the sex industry , carmen bravo , a spokesperson for the comisiones obreras union said the issue of prostitution has radically changed due to global migration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of women , without husbands or partners , are immigrating from africa or latin america to countries like spain .
many , according to bravo , have no option but to work as prostitutes and are forced to live practically like slaves .
today , only two percent of spain 's estimated 400,000 prostitutes are spanish . still , there 's no consensus on what to do about the matter . rhut mestre is a legal researcher who works with migrants , women and sex workers . rather than simply regulate and legalize the whole sex industry , she wants prostitutes to be given legal rights .

officers will be handing out the red and yellow cards to any troublemakers in the city 's so-called golden mile , between broad street and the arcadian .
the cards will warn people they face arrest if caught behaving badly again .
launched on saturday , the six-month scheme is also set to include making checks on door staff to ensure they are registered to work .
offenders arrested people caught using obscene language , throwing litter , obstructing roads , using threatening behaviour or urinating in the street will be given the cards .
sgt ade wilson said he hoped the scheme would prevent short-term reoffending .
" if an offender commits an offence and is issued with a yellow card their details will be entered onto crime reporting systems .
" if they commit a further offence under the scheme within six months they will be issued with a red card and prosecuted .
" if these people refuse to show consideration for others and are warned more than once they will be arrested . "

cla wales director julian salmon said : " we are concerned that visitors to the countryside find out where they can and ca n't go before setting off , and what they can and ca n't do once they get there . "
he said the new rights did not constitute a general right to roam anywhere .
" these areas of land still belong to the farmers and landowners . " said mr salmon .
" they still have to pay for its upkeep , maintenance and conservation , as well as try to make a living from farming these areas . "

more than 20 tonnes of uranium and 160kg of plutonium spewed onto a floor when a pipe fractured at the thorp reprocessing complex in january .
the british nuclear group , which carried out the inquiry , stressed that the material leaked into a sealed cell .
the discovery was made after a camera inspection of the cell in april .
it was classified as a level 3 accident by the international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- because of the acid released in the incident .
ines measurements listed the 1986 chernobyl disaster as a level 7 incident and three mile island in the united states in 1979 as level 5 . "
i am disappointed that plant indicators were not acted upon as quickly as they should have been " sellafield managing director barry snelson the leak occurred when a pipe - just a few centimetres wide - fractured , sending nitric acid onto the floor of the concrete-lined cell .
the cells , which are 60 metres long and 20 metres high , are not accessible to staff and no-one was exposed to radioactive material .
according to the british nuclear group 's findings , the pipe failed because of metal fatigue , which may have started to occur as early as august 2004 .
the report recommended that improvements be made to the maintenance and testing procedures at thorp , which remains closed since the leak .
complacency addressed detailed reviews into engineering and operating practices throughout the plant should also be conducted , it concluded .
barry snelson , managing director at sellafield , said : " i will personally be ensuring that recommendations are implemented not just in thorp , but across sellafield .
