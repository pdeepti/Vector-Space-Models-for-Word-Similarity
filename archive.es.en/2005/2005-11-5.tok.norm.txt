but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .

" the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together . " germany will not fall as a result of this , " he quipped . former powerbrokers shaped by left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder were shaped by the left-wing student movement since gerhard schröder became chancellor seven years ago , the country has effectively been run by politicians whose ideology was shaped by the left-wing student movement that sprang up in europe in 1968 . the figurehead of this generation was outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , who was an activist in the early 1970s and was confronted four years ago with a photograph of himself beating up a policeman during a riot . merkel and platzeck only began their political careers in 1989 , cutting their teeth in the east german dissident movement that led to the fall of the berlin wall . bild newspaper on thursday published black and white pictures of " the most powerful politicians in germany " in 1990 when nobody could have guessed they would one day be known as such . " a question of chance " a bearded platzeck was a member of parliament for the popular alliance 90 movement and a mousy merkel a spokeswoman for the last separate east german government . but political analyst oskar niedermayer from berlin 's free university said the pair 's rise to power was " much more a question of chance " than a sign that east germans were about to become the new political elite . eckhardt rehberg , a lawmaker from east germany for merkel 's christian democratic union , used a football analogy to explain the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will be the first woman - and " ossie " - chancellor " there is no ' ossi quota ' in politics , just like there is n't one in the bundesliga , " he said .
" the league was made bigger at the start of the 90s to make place for the teams from the east .
but today there are 18 teams in the first division and only one of them comes from the former gdr . " apart from merkel , the incoming government includes only two ministers who hail from the former east : the spd mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee , who will become transport minister and the cdu 's thomas de maiziere who has been named merkel 's chief of staff . schröder 's outgoing government counted only one ossi , manfred stolpe , who served as minister for transport and the reconstruction of the east . until now the spd 's most notable east german had been wolfgang thierse , the speaker of the lower house of parliament , but he will be succeeded by a conservative from the west , norbert lammert , when the new government takes office later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .
on the contrary , it has prompted harsh criticism and raised doubts over his future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.11.2005 bayern munich show bremen the ropes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich and michael ballack were all over werder bremen bayern munich showed werder bremen who 's boss in the bundesliga with a decisive 3-1 victory over the northern germans .
the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .
in the last four matches , coach friedhelm funkel 's players have gone a scoring binge , and taken home nine points in those game with 11 goals .
on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne .

most importantly , both of them grew up behind the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party revolt led to franz müntefering 's resignation after platzeck was named wednesday to replace franz müntefering as head of the social democrats , the german press heralded the dawning of the age of the " ossis " - the colloquial term for east germans . " the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics .

in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bela anda : the government 's hermes outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .
the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .

but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .

in aulnay-sous-bois , a suburb of 80,000 people northeast of paris , several thousand residents marched past the shells of burnt out vehicles with a banner reading " no to violence , yes to dialogue . " " it 's a sign that the laws of the republic apply to everyone and that we will not give in to violence , " said mayor gerard gaudron , a member of the governing ump party . calls for sarkozy to step down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy sarkozy and his hardline rhetoric has become a focus for much of the anger , with the rioters vowing to keep up their actions until he is forced to resign . the interior minister has been criticised for labelling delinquent youths " rabble " and declaring he would clean widespread crime out of the suburbs with " a power-hose . " his tough law-and-order policies over the past three years earned him the support of voters , who made him france 's most popular politician - a big boost for his ambition of running for president in 2007 elections . but the rioting has badly tarnished his reputation , and opposition communist and greens politicians have called for him to step down . sarkozy has rejected that path .
early saturday he made a surprise visit to a police command centre west of paris , and told officers : " arrests - that 's the key . " he urged them to get more information on those causing the trouble " so we can better understand how they 're organised , because they are organized . " villepin is seeking to calm tensions , meeting with suburban youths and holding regular meetings with ministers and mayors to find ways to deescalate the situation , so far without success . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.11.2005 bayern munich show bremen the ropes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich and michael ballack were all over werder bremen bayern munich showed werder bremen who 's boss in the bundesliga with a decisive 3-1 victory over the northern germans .
the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .
in the last four matches , coach friedhelm funkel 's players have gone a scoring binge , and taken home nine points in those game with 11 goals .
on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .

on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .
in the last four matches , coach friedhelm funkel 's players have gone a scoring binge , and taken home nine points in those game with 11 goals .
on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .
christian tiffert ’ s goal in the 10th minute sealed the game . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top trio pulls away in bundesliga german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics .

above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .

most importantly , both of them grew up behind the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party revolt led to franz müntefering 's resignation after platzeck was named wednesday to replace franz müntefering as head of the social democrats , the german press heralded the dawning of the age of the " ossis " - the colloquial term for east germans . " the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together . " germany will not fall as a result of this , " he quipped . former powerbrokers shaped by left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder were shaped by the left-wing student movement since gerhard schröder became chancellor seven years ago , the country has effectively been run by politicians whose ideology was shaped by the left-wing student movement that sprang up in europe in 1968 . the figurehead of this generation was outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , who was an activist in the early 1970s and was confronted four years ago with a photograph of himself beating up a policeman during a riot . merkel and platzeck only began their political careers in 1989 , cutting their teeth in the east german dissident movement that led to the fall of the berlin wall . bild newspaper on thursday published black and white pictures of " the most powerful politicians in germany " in 1990 when nobody could have guessed they would one day be known as such . " a question of chance " a bearded platzeck was a member of parliament for the popular alliance 90 movement and a mousy merkel a spokeswoman for the last separate east german government . but political analyst oskar niedermayer from berlin 's free university said the pair 's rise to power was " much more a question of chance " than a sign that east germans were about to become the new political elite . eckhardt rehberg , a lawmaker from east germany for merkel 's christian democratic union , used a football analogy to explain the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will be the first woman - and " ossie " - chancellor " there is no ' ossi quota ' in politics , just like there is n't one in the bundesliga , " he said .
" the league was made bigger at the start of the 90s to make place for the teams from the east .
but today there are 18 teams in the first division and only one of them comes from the former gdr . " apart from merkel , the incoming government includes only two ministers who hail from the former east : the spd mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee , who will become transport minister and the cdu 's thomas de maiziere who has been named merkel 's chief of staff . schröder 's outgoing government counted only one ossi , manfred stolpe , who served as minister for transport and the reconstruction of the east . until now the spd 's most notable east german had been wolfgang thierse , the speaker of the lower house of parliament , but he will be succeeded by a conservative from the west , norbert lammert , when the new government takes office later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber departs to the sound of sharpening knives in the midst of all the chaos in berlin , edmund stoiber may have hoped his departure from the cabinet would pass without much comment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .
in the last four matches , coach friedhelm funkel 's players have gone a scoring binge , and taken home nine points in those game with 11 goals .
on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .
christian tiffert ’ s goal in the 10th minute sealed the game . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top trio pulls away in bundesliga german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?
what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .

duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .

on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 germany looks east for new leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breaking new ground : matthias platzeck , 51 , the new spd leader with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification . merkel , who is expected to become germany 's first female chancellor later this month , and new social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader platzeck are both 51 years old - a decade younger than their party predecessors . both are trained scientists , both are protestant .
most importantly , both of them grew up behind the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party revolt led to franz müntefering 's resignation after platzeck was named wednesday to replace franz müntefering as head of the social democrats , the german press heralded the dawning of the age of the " ossis " - the colloquial term for east germans . " the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together . " germany will not fall as a result of this , " he quipped . former powerbrokers shaped by left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder were shaped by the left-wing student movement since gerhard schröder became chancellor seven years ago , the country has effectively been run by politicians whose ideology was shaped by the left-wing student movement that sprang up in europe in 1968 . the figurehead of this generation was outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , who was an activist in the early 1970s and was confronted four years ago with a photograph of himself beating up a policeman during a riot . merkel and platzeck only began their political careers in 1989 , cutting their teeth in the east german dissident movement that led to the fall of the berlin wall . bild newspaper on thursday published black and white pictures of " the most powerful politicians in germany " in 1990 when nobody could have guessed they would one day be known as such . " a question of chance " a bearded platzeck was a member of parliament for the popular alliance 90 movement and a mousy merkel a spokeswoman for the last separate east german government . but political analyst oskar niedermayer from berlin 's free university said the pair 's rise to power was " much more a question of chance " than a sign that east germans were about to become the new political elite . eckhardt rehberg , a lawmaker from east germany for merkel 's christian democratic union , used a football analogy to explain the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will be the first woman - and " ossie " - chancellor " there is no ' ossi quota ' in politics , just like there is n't one in the bundesliga , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .
" we have much smaller sums to work with , " he said .
" but we have the know-how . " klaus ulrich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no global moral view " in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 germany looks east for new leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breaking new ground : matthias platzeck , 51 , the new spd leader with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification . merkel , who is expected to become germany 's first female chancellor later this month , and new social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader platzeck are both 51 years old - a decade younger than their party predecessors . both are trained scientists , both are protestant .
most importantly , both of them grew up behind the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party revolt led to franz müntefering 's resignation after platzeck was named wednesday to replace franz müntefering as head of the social democrats , the german press heralded the dawning of the age of the " ossis " - the colloquial term for east germans . " the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together . " germany will not fall as a result of this , " he quipped . former powerbrokers shaped by left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder were shaped by the left-wing student movement since gerhard schröder became chancellor seven years ago , the country has effectively been run by politicians whose ideology was shaped by the left-wing student movement that sprang up in europe in 1968 . the figurehead of this generation was outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , who was an activist in the early 1970s and was confronted four years ago with a photograph of himself beating up a policeman during a riot . merkel and platzeck only began their political careers in 1989 , cutting their teeth in the east german dissident movement that led to the fall of the berlin wall . bild newspaper on thursday published black and white pictures of " the most powerful politicians in germany " in 1990 when nobody could have guessed they would one day be known as such . " a question of chance " a bearded platzeck was a member of parliament for the popular alliance 90 movement and a mousy merkel a spokeswoman for the last separate east german government . but political analyst oskar niedermayer from berlin 's free university said the pair 's rise to power was " much more a question of chance " than a sign that east germans were about to become the new political elite . eckhardt rehberg , a lawmaker from east germany for merkel 's christian democratic union , used a football analogy to explain the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will be the first woman - and " ossie " - chancellor " there is no ' ossi quota ' in politics , just like there is n't one in the bundesliga , " he said .

most importantly , both of them grew up behind the iron curtain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party revolt led to franz müntefering 's resignation after platzeck was named wednesday to replace franz müntefering as head of the social democrats , the german press heralded the dawning of the age of the " ossis " - the colloquial term for east germans . " the generation of ' 68 has made way for the generation of ' 89 , " the left-wing daily tageszeitung said on thursday , referring to the year the berlin wall came down . " a new trend has hit the nation .
it 's called ossi power ! " shouted the westfälischer anzeiger . and bild newspaper 's front page screamed : " the ossis are now the bossies . " irony of common roots it said merkel and platzeck enjoyed the advantage of not having been brought up in the old german school of politics .
" they had a life before the party and learnt to think in a different way politically . " the two politicians will work closely together to steer a so-called " grand coalition " of the left and right currently being negotiated after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in september 's general elections . the irony of their common roots was not lost on platzeck , who told reporters : " we were assured by several catholics from the rhine area today that they could live with the sight of two protestants from the east possibly signing the coalition accord , if it comes together . " germany will not fall as a result of this , " he quipped . former powerbrokers shaped by left bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder were shaped by the left-wing student movement since gerhard schröder became chancellor seven years ago , the country has effectively been run by politicians whose ideology was shaped by the left-wing student movement that sprang up in europe in 1968 . the figurehead of this generation was outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer , who was an activist in the early 1970s and was confronted four years ago with a photograph of himself beating up a policeman during a riot . merkel and platzeck only began their political careers in 1989 , cutting their teeth in the east german dissident movement that led to the fall of the berlin wall . bild newspaper on thursday published black and white pictures of " the most powerful politicians in germany " in 1990 when nobody could have guessed they would one day be known as such . " a question of chance " a bearded platzeck was a member of parliament for the popular alliance 90 movement and a mousy merkel a spokeswoman for the last separate east german government . but political analyst oskar niedermayer from berlin 's free university said the pair 's rise to power was " much more a question of chance " than a sign that east germans were about to become the new political elite . eckhardt rehberg , a lawmaker from east germany for merkel 's christian democratic union , used a football analogy to explain the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel will be the first woman - and " ossie " - chancellor " there is no ' ossi quota ' in politics , just like there is n't one in the bundesliga , " he said .

" his tough law-and-order policies over the past three years earned him the support of voters , who made him france 's most popular politician - a big boost for his ambition of running for president in 2007 elections . but the rioting has badly tarnished his reputation , and opposition communist and greens politicians have called for him to step down . sarkozy has rejected that path .
early saturday he made a surprise visit to a police command centre west of paris , and told officers : " arrests - that 's the key . " he urged them to get more information on those causing the trouble " so we can better understand how they 're organised , because they are organized .

they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 keeping stem cells cold , very cold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storage of stem cells has posed a challenge to scientists doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .

it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "

the rest of the league must look on how the defending champs have taken control . it was 18 months ago in may 2004 that werder bremen went to munich to seal the bundesliga title and de-throne bayern munich .
a tie was all that was needed to clinch the championship but to make a point to the doubters , coach thomas schaaf wanted his squad to win .
they went out and silenced the hostile munich crowd with a resounding 3-1 victory .
in bremen , the team 's supporters journeyed to the airport to celebrate the team 's third bundesliga crown .
this saturday , they can watch old videos of that victory because bayern returned the favor and handily defeated bremen 3-1 at the allianz arena . the circumstances on this saturday were slightly different .
no title was on the line yet the competitiveness of the league lay in the balance .
coach felix magath 's squad made sure that an imbalance was the final result and now lie five points ahead of bremen .
only hamburg are in what would be called striking distance .
they could pull to within in four points if they beat mönchengladbach on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bastian schweinsteiger equalized and then bayern pulled away bremen did manage to pull off what five other bundesliga opponents had failed to do this season - score at the allianz arena .
and that in the very first minute on a miroslav klose header , his league-leading 12th goal .
but instead of being shocked by the lightning strike , bayern retaliated and bastian schweinsteiger scored the equalizer 120 seconds later . claudio pizarro put the home side ahead in the 34th minute after a beautiful cross by brazilian ze roberto .
roy makaay sealed the fate of the visitors one minute before halftime . " like everybody else in the stadium , i was happy about roy makaay 's goal , " said magath after the game . the joy , and relief , was written on the dutch striker 's face .
it was his first goal in 1124 bundesliga minutes . schalke with easy win schalke ended a strong week with an unthreatened 3-0 win in a ruhr valley derby against duisburg .
61,000 fans in gelsenkirchen saw the " royal blues " take an early lead on international striker kevin kuranyi 's fourth goal of the season .
coach ralf rangnick had to look on with a little unease as his side could n't put the finishing touches in the first half .
duisburg midfielder alexander meyer helped the coach who has been under some intense criticism by scoring an own goal .
dario rodriguez finished off the scoring four minutes before time .
on tuesday , schalke won its first champions league contest against fenerbahce istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- scored to put the royal blues in the lead one other team that is clawing it way into the top third of the standings is hertha berlin .
led by marchelinho , they continued their high-scoring ways of late and downed hapless kaiserslautern 3-0 at home .
the brazilian midfielder made sure 17th-place lautern would not move up the standings any by scoring in the sixth minute .
early second-half goals by marko pantelic and nando rafael increased the pressure on red devils ' coach mike henke who is fighting for his job and is now very doubtful of his team 's talent . " a performance like this is hard to explain .
that had little to do with soccer , " commented the embattled coach . late draws save jobs this week , nuremberg coach wolfgang wolf lost his job .
hanover coach ewald lienen and cologne frontman uwe rapolder were also on the hot seat .
they at least remain there until the next match day in two weeks but thanks to two-last minute draws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas brdaric , here against bremen , pulled hanover to within one against mainz in hanover , the home side roared back from a 2-0 deficit in the second-half to salvage a 2-2 draw .
michael tarnat scored a goal in a desperate scene in the last moment so that lienen can live to coach another week .
just moments before , the fans in the crowd had been chanting " lienen must go ! "
that is unlikely following the emotional sideline scenes after the final whistle . in wolfsburg , 19-year old substitute denis epstein 's strike in the 88th minute saved uwe rapolder from possibly losing his job .
it equalized diego klimowicz ' first-half goal and ended a six-game losing streak for cologne . " we gave away the game , and not for the first time this year , " said wolfsburg coach holger fach after the match . frankfurt on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt , here marco rehmer , have had reason to punch their fists in the air the past four weeks after eight match days , frankfurt had scored a meager three goals and had four points .
in the last four matches , coach friedhelm funkel 's players have gone a scoring binge , and taken home nine points in those game with 11 goals .
on saturday , the frankfurters trounced bielefeld 3-0 .
francisco capido started the scoring in the 35th minute .
alexander meier had two second-half strikes to leave the guests without a chance . in leverkusen , michael skibbe got his first victory as coach .
it came against his old side dortmund , 2-1 .
dortmund defender florian kringe was the unlucky one in this match .
he scored an own goal in the 86th minute to hand the home side the win albeit leverkusen dictated most of the match and deserved the victory . hamburg ’ s title challenge faltered again on sunday as the third placed team failed to capitalize on bremen ’ s defeat and were lucky to come away from mönchengladbach with a point .
the 0-0 draw leaves hamburg six points behind leaders bayern munich .
mönchengaldbach ’ s oliver neuville went close with a free kick and eugen polanski headed against a post to produce the best chances for gladbach while hamburg struggled to create any real chances . stuttgart were equally ineffective against nuremberg in the other sunday game but did just enough to get the win they needed to ease the pressure on coach giovanni trapattoni .
christian tiffert ’ s goal in the 10th minute sealed the game . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top trio pulls away in bundesliga german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .

but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in . günter fuhr is n't just head of the fraunhofer institut of biomedical technology .
he 's also a sort of bank director , although there are no atm 's outside his branch .
his institute does n't deal with cold cash , but extremely cold temperatures .
it 's a cryogenics bank , developed and built by his team , which stores stem cell cultures .
in order to conduct research on the stem cell cultures , they have to be available at any time .
that means , they must be preserved and stored , frozen in liquid nitrogen at negative 196 degrees celsius , according to fuhr . " normally cells are stored in plastic tubes that are about a centimeter long , and which hold about 10 milliliters of fluid , " fuhr sagt .
" that is billions of cells .
and usually one only needs just one drop with several million cells to have enough to answer many questions in medicine and biotech . "
that is why the fraunhofer institute in st. ingbert in southwest germany is developing a vial that can dispense one million cells at a time .
it is something akin to the films that tablets sometimes come in that allow them to be dispensed one at a time .
but these vials can keep the stem cells in good condition for up to 30 years .
one of the institute 's visions of the near future involves taking blood from the placenta and umbilical cord of a baby , which contain stem cells , shortly after birth .
the cell cultures would then go to the cryobank where they would be frozen and stored , ideally for the lifetime of the individual .
if the person were to later develop a serious illness , the stem cells could be defrosted and used in treatment .
unique in the world the fraunhofer insitute 's cryobank is the only one of its kind in the world .
right now , it has the capacity to store the cell cultures of every single german resident in its 150 tanks .
the maintenance of the cultures , however , is fairly complicated .
to stay viable , samples can not ice up and can only be handled with a special apparatus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embryonic stem cell in order that the institute 's databank can keep track of their condition , special chips that can withstand extremely low temperatures had to be developed that set off an alarm if a sample has been stored improperly .
commercial future some of the tanks already have commercial uses , as several pharmaceutical companies are paying to store valuable samples in them .
since each of the tanks is valued at several million euros , security measures are strict , and somewhat unusual .
" the fire department ca n't extinguish any fires that might break out around them with water , since it would leak into the tanks and ruin them , " said fuhr .
" the tanks are very special containers and are vacuum-sealed .
they can withstand some 10 to 20 seconds right in the middle of a fire . "
the institute has been able to sell its cryogenic technology to companies in germany , the us and spain .
other countries , such as korea and japan , have also shown interest .
but there is still a ways to go before a profit is realized .
the institute has made about 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- on an investment of three million .
despite the negative profit margins , fuhr says the institute is on the right path .
in the us , investment in cryobanks is booming ; in california alone , the governor has announced a $ 150 million investment in cell banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2005 schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bela anda : the government 's hermes outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .
the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .

the outgoing government spokesman , bela anda was gerhard schröder 's man to the public to the very end . the job of lead government spokesman requires great skill and verbal talent , assertiveness and dexterity - and , of course , sensibility . for his boss , bela anda was n't just a press advisor charged with representing chancellor gerhard schröder 's statements or decisions .
above all , he was charged with putting out fires , often started by government officials making rash statements . sometimes it was more of a war than an information machine , said anda .
" there are always moments where you just have to play along , and others when you just have to endure the heat . " the job does n't appear to have left scars .
after all , anda is skilled in verbal defense , clearly and deliberately articulating each word as he answers media questions at the government 's regular press conferences .
charged with doing the talking without giving anything away , some journalists call anda the " say nothing " press spokesman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answering the media deftly but he knows all the tricks , since anda is a pressman through and through .
previously a journalist for mass-circulation bild zeitung , he changed sides a few years after co-writing a biography of schröder in 1996 .
in 1999 , he became a spokesman in the government 's public affairs bureau .
three years later , he was named the lead spokesman and put in charge of the government 's press office . " it was so tough , " he recalled .
" it was completely different working on the other side .
for example , i would hear something and think , ' that could be a great story . ' but later , i would have to bite my tongue because it would be something i could not give away .
one learns a lot in seven years on the inside . " hermes in action anda has two main areas of responsibilities .
on the one hand , he keeps the chancellor informed about what the media is saying .
on the other , he relays the government 's decisions to the public .
and this he does with the help of the 580 employees of the government 's press and information office from its locations in berlin and bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the thick of things they create the communications strategy for the government and liaison with more than 100 foreign and domestic newspapers and 80 radio and tv programs .
but the most important role he plays , anda said , is to report to the chancellor personally and advise him on communication .
as a result , he sees his role partly as that of hermes , the herald of the greek gods . " the most important thing about my job is to recognize that there is a border between information and indiscretion and that one has to redefine that border every day , " he said . ambassador from the heart of power and he is not only around for the decision-making process but is actually part of making decisions , sitting in cabinet meetings and in strategy planning sessions at the chancellery .
anda said it 's important to him to know how the decisions are made so he can relay them more effectively to the public .
and yet , he stills spends many hours qualifying or denying various statements from government officials . during his tenure as press spokesman , there was nothing he ever had to relate to the public that he personally believed was false , anda said .
that 's not to say that just avoided saying things he disagreed with .
on the contrary , anda is known for his strong loyalty to schröder .
and , he said that overall , he was satisfied with the flow of information from the top . critics in the opposition have called him a liar , and he was under tremendous pressure when agenda 2010 , the chancellor 's package of labor market reforms was revealed .
but his job was to be the administration 's salesman and hock its programs , he said .
and that includes responding effectively to critics . " i believe in the philosophy that each attack should be answered quickly and with force , " anda said . sebastian schubert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government spokesman acquitted a berlin court threw out a case raised by a photographer against chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman , bela anda , for losing photos of the chancellor .

groups of demonstrators approached security cordons around the summit , and a bank was set on fire as police fired tear gas to disperse the rioters .
us president george w bush is one of the leaders present , for discussions which include free trade and poverty .
mr bush faces opposition over plans to revive talks on a free trade area .
as the meeting opened , there was no indication that any compromise had been reached .
venezuela 's leader hugo chavez told protesters earlier he would bury the free trade area of the americas -lrb- ftaa -rrb- - and defeat us " imperialism " .
poverty more than 8,000 police have been drafted in to protect the fourth americas summit , being held in the argentine beach town of mar del plata . "
only united can we defeat imperialism and bring our people a better life " hugo chavez in pictures : summit clashes protests began peacefully , as thousands of demonstrators chanted " get out bush " .
they marched through boarded-up streets a few kilometres away from the summit venue itself .
demonstrators included argentine former football legend diego maradona .
but smaller groups armed with wooden clubs and wearing bandanas began burning us flags , throwing stones and petrol bombs , smashing windows and setting fire to shops .
police used tear gas to disperse them , slowly pushing them away from the summit area down one of the town 's main streets .
local media reports said 20 demonstrators had been injured in clashes with police .
police said 64 people were arrested , and the situation was " under control " .
' defeat imperialism ' protesters argue that us-backed free-market policies have pushed millions into poverty in the region .
addressing their rally in a football stadium , mr chavez said : " here , in mar del plata , ftaa will be buried ! "
he called for help , saying : " only united can we defeat imperialism and bring our people a better life . "
other demonstrations were held in the argentine capital buenos aires , and in uruguay and venezuela .
the venezuelan government has said that it will reject any summit declaration which contains references to free trade in the americas .
however , mexico 's president vicente fox has said 29 of the 34 summit nations are willing to move forward with free trade negotiations without dissenting countries .
apart from venezuela , those nations opposed to the creation of a huge free trade zone include argentina , brazil , uruguay and paraguay .
us interest renewed the rivalry between mr bush and mr chavez is expected to dominate the meeting .
asked at a news conference how he would approach mr chavez , mr bush replied that he would be " polite " .
the bbc 's south america correspondent steve kingstone says mr chavez 's growing influence helps explain washington 's renewed involvement in the region .
security , democracy and trade are the main areas of interest for the us in latin america , and on all three counts , venezuela 's leader is causing concern , our correspondent says .
washington is concerned about military build-up in venezuela , suspects it of meddling in bolivia 's election campaign and fears mr chavez 's talk of closer ties between latin american nations may attract leaders away from us plans for a huge free trade zone , he adds .
