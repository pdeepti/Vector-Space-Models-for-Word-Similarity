program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2005 italy votes on assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's likely not to vote italians are called to vote in a national referendum on sunday and monday aimed at changing the country 's law on assisted fertility , one of the most restrictive in europe . a bitter debate has broken out among supporters and opponents of the current law with church leaders and politicians strongly voicing their positions .
the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- controversial experiments in search of a cure stem cell research remains ethically controversial , but scientists are nonetheless hoping that it might be the solution to diseases of the central nervous system .
-lrb- may 14 , 2005 -rrb- swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .
other european countries have adopted more liberal laws .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .

the 30 unesco world cultural heritage sites in germany are an exhilarating way to see both natural and cultural " wonders . " the admittance to the list of unesco world cultural heritage sites is by no means easy .
once a spot makes it onto the list , it is no guarantee that it will stay there .
cologne 's mammoth , gothic-style cathedral , for example , finds its status endangered because of construction around the 157-meter high structure that could obstruct a visitor 's view . nevertheless , it probably ranks as one of the most popular attractions on the german heritage site list .
cologne is also near to numerous other world heritage sites in the west of germany , such as the cathedral in aachen , where charlemagne reigned over 1,200 years ago .
another sacral site is the cathedral in speyer , a classical example of romanesque architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein in essen if the serenity of churches is less appealing , the tourist can visit landmarks of the industrialization of germany from the 19th and 20th centuries .
in essen in the ruhr river valley , the zollverein coal mine industrial complex shows the visitor just what it 's like to mine coal .
fans of bauhaus-style architecture will be thrilled by one of the masterpieces of the architects fritz schupp and martin kremmer .
in the far west , near saarbrücken , the massive völklingen ironworks leave the tourist in pure awe of the conditions iron and steelworkers had to work in . hanseatic wealth in the north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall from the 14th to 16th centuries , the hanseatic league catapulted the north of germany to unknown wealth and power .

with their money , they could have buildings erected that were unlike anything else in their time .
bremen 's city hall is a classic example of the weser renaissance .
stralsund just before the island of rügen thrived in medieval times and the merchants were patrons to breathtaking structures .
literature fans will not want to miss a visit to the city of lübeck , home of thomas and heinrich mann . further inland to the south , copper , zinc and lead ores were mined in rammelsberg near the city of goslar as far back as 1,000 years ago .
so vital was the city for its natural resources , that german emperors , most prominently frederick barbarossa , conducted court here . parks , castles and reformation in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wartburg in eisenach the wartburg castle in eisenach has the historical significance of being martin luther 's refuge when the father of the reformation was threatened with death in the early 16th century .
the castle is 900 years old and rests stately above the city . on berlin 's museum island , some of the world 's greatest museums are clustered in the middle of the capital and are a must see for art and history lovers .
if marble and concrete only cause blisters on visitors ' feet , then the numerous parks in and around the palaces of berlin and potsdam can be a welcome source of relief . in saxony , 18 kilometers of the elbe river valley in and around dresden provide a beautiful mix of city and nature .

the 30 unesco world cultural heritage sites in germany are an exhilarating way to see both natural and cultural " wonders . " the admittance to the list of unesco world cultural heritage sites is by no means easy .
once a spot makes it onto the list , it is no guarantee that it will stay there .
cologne 's mammoth , gothic-style cathedral , for example , finds its status endangered because of construction around the 157-meter high structure that could obstruct a visitor 's view . nevertheless , it probably ranks as one of the most popular attractions on the german heritage site list .
cologne is also near to numerous other world heritage sites in the west of germany , such as the cathedral in aachen , where charlemagne reigned over 1,200 years ago .
another sacral site is the cathedral in speyer , a classical example of romanesque architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein in essen if the serenity of churches is less appealing , the tourist can visit landmarks of the industrialization of germany from the 19th and 20th centuries .
in essen in the ruhr river valley , the zollverein coal mine industrial complex shows the visitor just what it 's like to mine coal .
fans of bauhaus-style architecture will be thrilled by one of the masterpieces of the architects fritz schupp and martin kremmer .
in the far west , near saarbrücken , the massive völklingen ironworks leave the tourist in pure awe of the conditions iron and steelworkers had to work in . hanseatic wealth in the north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall from the 14th to 16th centuries , the hanseatic league catapulted the north of germany to unknown wealth and power .

with their money , they could have buildings erected that were unlike anything else in their time .
bremen 's city hall is a classic example of the weser renaissance .
stralsund just before the island of rügen thrived in medieval times and the merchants were patrons to breathtaking structures .
literature fans will not want to miss a visit to the city of lübeck , home of thomas and heinrich mann . further inland to the south , copper , zinc and lead ores were mined in rammelsberg near the city of goslar as far back as 1,000 years ago .
so vital was the city for its natural resources , that german emperors , most prominently frederick barbarossa , conducted court here . parks , castles and reformation in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wartburg in eisenach the wartburg castle in eisenach has the historical significance of being martin luther 's refuge when the father of the reformation was threatened with death in the early 16th century .
the castle is 900 years old and rests stately above the city . on berlin 's museum island , some of the world 's greatest museums are clustered in the middle of the capital and are a must see for art and history lovers .
if marble and concrete only cause blisters on visitors ' feet , then the numerous parks in and around the palaces of berlin and potsdam can be a welcome source of relief . in saxony , 18 kilometers of the elbe river valley in and around dresden provide a beautiful mix of city and nature .
on the polish border in the southeast , count von pückler-muskau mapped out an exceptional garden with the muskauer park . picturesque church in a meadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's most photographed locations - the wieskirche church in southern bavaria probably one of the most photographed churches in southern germany is the wieskirche .
standing on top of a hill in a meadow , the church reflects the high-point of rococo architecture in the 18th century . far to the north yet still in bavaria , the river regnitz beautifies the city of bamberg .
the town was virtually unscathed by bombers in world war ii so the 1,000 year architectural history of the franconian city is a showcase . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de potsdam : beyond berlin 's shadow located just outside of germany 's capital berlin , potsdam is brimming with architectural and cultural sites , not to mention a beautiful tranquil setting amidst woods and lakes .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster .

" it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .

companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .

be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .

erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .

firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls .

" but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .

not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .

" going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

" " i hope ... a compromise can be found and that the british government will give active contribution for it , " barroso said in a bbc interview . the annual rebate , currently worth 3.1 billion pounds -lrb- 4.6 billion euros , $ 5.7 billion -rrb- was set to be a decisive issue at the eu summit in brussels on thursday and friday that would discuss eu spending plans for 2007 to 2013 . eu foreign ministers headed for luxembourg sunday for 11th-hour talks aimed at striking a deal on the crisis-hit bloc 's budget plans , although hopes of an immediate breakthrough seemed slim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barley ears in field with cows in background london originally justified the rebate when it was agreed in 1984 on the grounds that britain , with a relatively small farming sector , benefited little from the eu 's costly common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . blair calls for fundamental review british prime minister tony blair , who assumes the chair of the rotating eu presidency next month , has refused to give way however , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending . other eu members , including france , germany , spain and the netherlands , want the rebate to be renegotiated to take account of britain 's greater wealth and the needs of new member states in central and eastern europe . " i think the british government understands and should understand clearly that conditions have changed , " barroso told the bbc .
" we are no longer as we were 20 years ago .
britain is much richer .
there are countries now , new eu countries , that are much poorer .
it would not be fair for them to support proportionately more of the burden than britain . " brown meanwhile told britain 's independent itv television channel that the rebate " arises from the fundamental unfairness " of cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " the idea that the source of problems in the european union is a rebate that is given to britain when 40 percent and more of the european union budget goes to agriculture is completely unacceptable , " he said .
" you can not remove a rebate or talk about how the rebate is delivered until you 're prepared to talk about how the fundamental reform of the agriculture policy and of the way the budget 's constructed . " pressure to stay firm blair has said that without the rebate , which was won by his predecessor margaret thatcher 21 years ago , britain would have paid 15 times more than france into eu coffers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair is under pressure to stay firm on the budget rebate menzies campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for britain 's third main party the liberal democrats , urged blair to stand firm . " whatever the pressure this week , this is no time for the government to blink , " he said .
" only a wholesale review of european union finances and an end to the profligate common agricultural policy would justify a british concession .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2005 italy votes on assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's likely not to vote italians are called to vote in a national referendum on sunday and monday aimed at changing the country 's law on assisted fertility , one of the most restrictive in europe . a bitter debate has broken out among supporters and opponents of the current law with church leaders and politicians strongly voicing their positions .
the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- controversial experiments in search of a cure stem cell research remains ethically controversial , but scientists are nonetheless hoping that it might be the solution to diseases of the central nervous system .
-lrb- may 14 , 2005 -rrb- swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .
other european countries have adopted more liberal laws .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .

but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

the new company will employ about 127,000 people , but analysts believe that about 10,000 employees will lose their jobs as a result of the merger , reuters news agency reported .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .

" " i hope ... a compromise can be found and that the british government will give active contribution for it , " barroso said in a bbc interview . the annual rebate , currently worth 3.1 billion pounds -lrb- 4.6 billion euros , $ 5.7 billion -rrb- was set to be a decisive issue at the eu summit in brussels on thursday and friday that would discuss eu spending plans for 2007 to 2013 . eu foreign ministers headed for luxembourg sunday for 11th-hour talks aimed at striking a deal on the crisis-hit bloc 's budget plans , although hopes of an immediate breakthrough seemed slim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barley ears in field with cows in background london originally justified the rebate when it was agreed in 1984 on the grounds that britain , with a relatively small farming sector , benefited little from the eu 's costly common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . blair calls for fundamental review british prime minister tony blair , who assumes the chair of the rotating eu presidency next month , has refused to give way however , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending . other eu members , including france , germany , spain and the netherlands , want the rebate to be renegotiated to take account of britain 's greater wealth and the needs of new member states in central and eastern europe . " i think the british government understands and should understand clearly that conditions have changed , " barroso told the bbc .
" we are no longer as we were 20 years ago .
britain is much richer .
there are countries now , new eu countries , that are much poorer .
it would not be fair for them to support proportionately more of the burden than britain . " brown meanwhile told britain 's independent itv television channel that the rebate " arises from the fundamental unfairness " of cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " the idea that the source of problems in the european union is a rebate that is given to britain when 40 percent and more of the european union budget goes to agriculture is completely unacceptable , " he said .
" you can not remove a rebate or talk about how the rebate is delivered until you 're prepared to talk about how the fundamental reform of the agriculture policy and of the way the budget 's constructed . " pressure to stay firm blair has said that without the rebate , which was won by his predecessor margaret thatcher 21 years ago , britain would have paid 15 times more than france into eu coffers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair is under pressure to stay firm on the budget rebate menzies campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for britain 's third main party the liberal democrats , urged blair to stand firm . " whatever the pressure this week , this is no time for the government to blink , " he said .
" only a wholesale review of european union finances and an end to the profligate common agricultural policy would justify a british concession .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

the 30 unesco world cultural heritage sites in germany are an exhilarating way to see both natural and cultural " wonders . " the admittance to the list of unesco world cultural heritage sites is by no means easy .
once a spot makes it onto the list , it is no guarantee that it will stay there .
cologne 's mammoth , gothic-style cathedral , for example , finds its status endangered because of construction around the 157-meter high structure that could obstruct a visitor 's view . nevertheless , it probably ranks as one of the most popular attractions on the german heritage site list .
cologne is also near to numerous other world heritage sites in the west of germany , such as the cathedral in aachen , where charlemagne reigned over 1,200 years ago .
another sacral site is the cathedral in speyer , a classical example of romanesque architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein in essen if the serenity of churches is less appealing , the tourist can visit landmarks of the industrialization of germany from the 19th and 20th centuries .
in essen in the ruhr river valley , the zollverein coal mine industrial complex shows the visitor just what it 's like to mine coal .
fans of bauhaus-style architecture will be thrilled by one of the masterpieces of the architects fritz schupp and martin kremmer .
in the far west , near saarbrücken , the massive völklingen ironworks leave the tourist in pure awe of the conditions iron and steelworkers had to work in . hanseatic wealth in the north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall from the 14th to 16th centuries , the hanseatic league catapulted the north of germany to unknown wealth and power .
for the first time common citizens , namely merchants , had a say in political affairs .
with their money , they could have buildings erected that were unlike anything else in their time .
bremen 's city hall is a classic example of the weser renaissance .
stralsund just before the island of rügen thrived in medieval times and the merchants were patrons to breathtaking structures .
literature fans will not want to miss a visit to the city of lübeck , home of thomas and heinrich mann . further inland to the south , copper , zinc and lead ores were mined in rammelsberg near the city of goslar as far back as 1,000 years ago .
so vital was the city for its natural resources , that german emperors , most prominently frederick barbarossa , conducted court here . parks , castles and reformation in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wartburg in eisenach the wartburg castle in eisenach has the historical significance of being martin luther 's refuge when the father of the reformation was threatened with death in the early 16th century .
the castle is 900 years old and rests stately above the city . on berlin 's museum island , some of the world 's greatest museums are clustered in the middle of the capital and are a must see for art and history lovers .
if marble and concrete only cause blisters on visitors ' feet , then the numerous parks in and around the palaces of berlin and potsdam can be a welcome source of relief . in saxony , 18 kilometers of the elbe river valley in and around dresden provide a beautiful mix of city and nature .
on the polish border in the southeast , count von pückler-muskau mapped out an exceptional garden with the muskauer park . picturesque church in a meadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's most photographed locations - the wieskirche church in southern bavaria probably one of the most photographed churches in southern germany is the wieskirche .
standing on top of a hill in a meadow , the church reflects the high-point of rococo architecture in the 18th century . far to the north yet still in bavaria , the river regnitz beautifies the city of bamberg .
the town was virtually unscathed by bombers in world war ii so the 1,000 year architectural history of the franconian city is a showcase . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de potsdam : beyond berlin 's shadow located just outside of germany 's capital berlin , potsdam is brimming with architectural and cultural sites , not to mention a beautiful tranquil setting amidst woods and lakes .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

the 30 unesco world cultural heritage sites in germany are an exhilarating way to see both natural and cultural " wonders . " the admittance to the list of unesco world cultural heritage sites is by no means easy .
once a spot makes it onto the list , it is no guarantee that it will stay there .
cologne 's mammoth , gothic-style cathedral , for example , finds its status endangered because of construction around the 157-meter high structure that could obstruct a visitor 's view . nevertheless , it probably ranks as one of the most popular attractions on the german heritage site list .
cologne is also near to numerous other world heritage sites in the west of germany , such as the cathedral in aachen , where charlemagne reigned over 1,200 years ago .
another sacral site is the cathedral in speyer , a classical example of romanesque architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein in essen if the serenity of churches is less appealing , the tourist can visit landmarks of the industrialization of germany from the 19th and 20th centuries .
in essen in the ruhr river valley , the zollverein coal mine industrial complex shows the visitor just what it 's like to mine coal .
fans of bauhaus-style architecture will be thrilled by one of the masterpieces of the architects fritz schupp and martin kremmer .
in the far west , near saarbrücken , the massive völklingen ironworks leave the tourist in pure awe of the conditions iron and steelworkers had to work in . hanseatic wealth in the north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's city hall from the 14th to 16th centuries , the hanseatic league catapulted the north of germany to unknown wealth and power .
for the first time common citizens , namely merchants , had a say in political affairs .
with their money , they could have buildings erected that were unlike anything else in their time .
bremen 's city hall is a classic example of the weser renaissance .
stralsund just before the island of rügen thrived in medieval times and the merchants were patrons to breathtaking structures .
literature fans will not want to miss a visit to the city of lübeck , home of thomas and heinrich mann . further inland to the south , copper , zinc and lead ores were mined in rammelsberg near the city of goslar as far back as 1,000 years ago .
so vital was the city for its natural resources , that german emperors , most prominently frederick barbarossa , conducted court here . parks , castles and reformation in the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wartburg in eisenach the wartburg castle in eisenach has the historical significance of being martin luther 's refuge when the father of the reformation was threatened with death in the early 16th century .
the castle is 900 years old and rests stately above the city . on berlin 's museum island , some of the world 's greatest museums are clustered in the middle of the capital and are a must see for art and history lovers .
if marble and concrete only cause blisters on visitors ' feet , then the numerous parks in and around the palaces of berlin and potsdam can be a welcome source of relief . in saxony , 18 kilometers of the elbe river valley in and around dresden provide a beautiful mix of city and nature .
on the polish border in the southeast , count von pückler-muskau mapped out an exceptional garden with the muskauer park . picturesque church in a meadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's most photographed locations - the wieskirche church in southern bavaria probably one of the most photographed churches in southern germany is the wieskirche .
standing on top of a hill in a meadow , the church reflects the high-point of rococo architecture in the 18th century . far to the north yet still in bavaria , the river regnitz beautifies the city of bamberg .
the town was virtually unscathed by bombers in world war ii so the 1,000 year architectural history of the franconian city is a showcase . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de potsdam : beyond berlin 's shadow located just outside of germany 's capital berlin , potsdam is brimming with architectural and cultural sites , not to mention a beautiful tranquil setting amidst woods and lakes .
-lrb- march 2 , 2005 -rrb- essen : a changing industrial landscape essen 's moto for the european cultural capital bid is “ change through culture – culture through change ” .
for a city that has undergone many changes in its history , it is an apt slogan .
-lrb- march 2 , 2005 -rrb- cologne cathedral on unesco danger list cologne 's magnificent gothic cathedral has been placed on unesco 's list of world heritage in danger due to the increasing development of the german city 's skyline .

" " i hope ... a compromise can be found and that the british government will give active contribution for it , " barroso said in a bbc interview . the annual rebate , currently worth 3.1 billion pounds -lrb- 4.6 billion euros , $ 5.7 billion -rrb- was set to be a decisive issue at the eu summit in brussels on thursday and friday that would discuss eu spending plans for 2007 to 2013 . eu foreign ministers headed for luxembourg sunday for 11th-hour talks aimed at striking a deal on the crisis-hit bloc 's budget plans , although hopes of an immediate breakthrough seemed slim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barley ears in field with cows in background london originally justified the rebate when it was agreed in 1984 on the grounds that britain , with a relatively small farming sector , benefited little from the eu 's costly common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . blair calls for fundamental review british prime minister tony blair , who assumes the chair of the rotating eu presidency next month , has refused to give way however , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending . other eu members , including france , germany , spain and the netherlands , want the rebate to be renegotiated to take account of britain 's greater wealth and the needs of new member states in central and eastern europe . " i think the british government understands and should understand clearly that conditions have changed , " barroso told the bbc .
" we are no longer as we were 20 years ago .
britain is much richer .
there are countries now , new eu countries , that are much poorer .
it would not be fair for them to support proportionately more of the burden than britain . " brown meanwhile told britain 's independent itv television channel that the rebate " arises from the fundamental unfairness " of cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " the idea that the source of problems in the european union is a rebate that is given to britain when 40 percent and more of the european union budget goes to agriculture is completely unacceptable , " he said .
" you can not remove a rebate or talk about how the rebate is delivered until you 're prepared to talk about how the fundamental reform of the agriculture policy and of the way the budget 's constructed . " pressure to stay firm blair has said that without the rebate , which was won by his predecessor margaret thatcher 21 years ago , britain would have paid 15 times more than france into eu coffers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair is under pressure to stay firm on the budget rebate menzies campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for britain 's third main party the liberal democrats , urged blair to stand firm . " whatever the pressure this week , this is no time for the government to blink , " he said .
" only a wholesale review of european union finances and an end to the profligate common agricultural policy would justify a british concession .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .
" in one location in germany , on the island of föhr , we found 14 percent of the wild birds to be carriers of the virus , which is a lot . " wild geese the " culprits " ? however , she also warned that the viruses detected were not related to the asian avian flu virus , the h5n1 .
but there were viruses among those detected which have the potential to mutate and can trigger diseases in chickens , as a 2003 outbreak of avian plague in the netherlands showed . there , chickens were infected with a virus called h7n7 , most likely transmitted by wild geese .
in the tight confines of the chicken stalls , the virus was able to adapt and spread .
some 30 million birds needed to be slaughtered , almost 100 people were infected , and a veterinarian treating the chickens died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free range chickens need to be monitored in order to prevent a repeat of the epidemic , globig said free range chickens need to be put under special observation . mandatory testing " the most important thing is not to feed the animals out in the open , which attracts wild birds , " she said .
apart from that , poultry should be checked twice a year for the sub-types of avian flu . in the german state of lower saxony , such regular tests are already mandatory .
if one of the virus strains is detected , the birds must be slaughtered before the virus can mutate and pose a threat to human and animal health .
alternatively , animal breeders could adopt a widespread vaccination of poultry , a practice still not readily available on the market . virologists like robert webster have stressed the importance of investing more research in developing effective vaccines . " there is great emphasis in putting energy into vaccine strategies for humans , " he said .
" i would argue that the first emphasis should be stopping the h5n1 virus at the source : domestic ducks and chickens .

once a spot makes it onto the list , it is no guarantee that it will stay there .
cologne 's mammoth , gothic-style cathedral , for example , finds its status endangered because of construction around the 157-meter high structure that could obstruct a visitor 's view . nevertheless , it probably ranks as one of the most popular attractions on the german heritage site list .
cologne is also near to numerous other world heritage sites in the west of germany , such as the cathedral in aachen , where charlemagne reigned over 1,200 years ago .
another sacral site is the cathedral in speyer , a classical example of romanesque architecture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zeche zollverein in essen if the serenity of churches is less appealing , the tourist can visit landmarks of the industrialization of germany from the 19th and 20th centuries .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .
after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .

after collecting more than 2,500 probes of ducks , geese , swans , sea gulls , storks and birds of prey , she injected the material into live chicken eggs .
in 21 cases , the virus appeared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 , the bird flu virus , under the microscope " among the ducks , which are regarded to be carriers of the influenza , 7.7 percent turned out to be positive , " she said .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .

as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .

in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .

eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 12.06.2005 germans move to prevent bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic chickens are at risk after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening . an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , a few years back killed 800 people world-wide and hit several asian economies hard .
the global community saw itself facing a highly contagious virus and moved fast to close off infectious regions , quarantining entire cities and blocking off major transport routes .
the sars scare sent a wake-up call to the international health community and drove home the necessity of global cooperation in preventing such epidemics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restaurant waitresses wear masks as protection against the deadly sars virus scientists are now worried about a strain of bird flu , known as h5n1 , which has already killed several dozen people in asia and has the potential to mutate into this century 's first pandemic , rivaling the 1918 spanish flu which killed millions .
the avian flu virus is currently transmitted by domestic birds .
it hits mostly in regions where poultry and human beings live in closely confined spaces . although at the moment h5n1 can not be easily transmitted from human to human , scientists say it is only a matter of time until this happens .
they also worry that migratory birds could carry the virus around the planet and thus spread the epidemic .
last month , more than 1,000 migratory geese were found dead from the strain of avian flu in china , an early warning sign of the virus ' ability to spread , said german virologist robert webster . " at the end of the breeding season , bareheaded geese migrate to india and across the himalayas , " he said .
" chances are that the h5n1 from asia will increase , and that is not good news , because the north and south migration routes all overlap . " slow transmission around the globe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists are studying the genetic makeup of avian flu webster , who is advising all countries to check their wild bird populations for the virus , said it may not reach europe this year , but given time the virus will slowly transmit across the breeding ranges of various birds . " it is not encouraging , " he said . anja globig , who works for the federal research institute for animal health on the island of riems , heeded the warning and called on volunteers and hunters to take probes from the droppings of wild birds .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .
but do ads disguised as content have a place in publicly funded programs ?

" " i hope ... a compromise can be found and that the british government will give active contribution for it , " barroso said in a bbc interview . the annual rebate , currently worth 3.1 billion pounds -lrb- 4.6 billion euros , $ 5.7 billion -rrb- was set to be a decisive issue at the eu summit in brussels on thursday and friday that would discuss eu spending plans for 2007 to 2013 . eu foreign ministers headed for luxembourg sunday for 11th-hour talks aimed at striking a deal on the crisis-hit bloc 's budget plans , although hopes of an immediate breakthrough seemed slim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barley ears in field with cows in background london originally justified the rebate when it was agreed in 1984 on the grounds that britain , with a relatively small farming sector , benefited little from the eu 's costly common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- . blair calls for fundamental review british prime minister tony blair , who assumes the chair of the rotating eu presidency next month , has refused to give way however , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending . other eu members , including france , germany , spain and the netherlands , want the rebate to be renegotiated to take account of britain 's greater wealth and the needs of new member states in central and eastern europe . " i think the british government understands and should understand clearly that conditions have changed , " barroso told the bbc .
" we are no longer as we were 20 years ago .
britain is much richer .
there are countries now , new eu countries , that are much poorer .
it would not be fair for them to support proportionately more of the burden than britain . " brown meanwhile told britain 's independent itv television channel that the rebate " arises from the fundamental unfairness " of cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " the idea that the source of problems in the european union is a rebate that is given to britain when 40 percent and more of the european union budget goes to agriculture is completely unacceptable , " he said .
" you can not remove a rebate or talk about how the rebate is delivered until you 're prepared to talk about how the fundamental reform of the agriculture policy and of the way the budget 's constructed . " pressure to stay firm blair has said that without the rebate , which was won by his predecessor margaret thatcher 21 years ago , britain would have paid 15 times more than france into eu coffers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair is under pressure to stay firm on the budget rebate menzies campbell , foreign affairs spokesman for britain 's third main party the liberal democrats , urged blair to stand firm .

the law , called " law 40 , " regulates access to assisted fertility in italy . the law has only been in existence since last year .
it took years of debate and members of parliament crossing party lines to finally win its approval . today , it 's one of the toughest laws on the subject in europe .
it bans the use of donor sperm or eggs , surrogate mothers and screening , freezing , research and experimentation on embryos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters showing italian actress sabrina ferilli campaigning for a yes vote many believe the reason for the existence of such a restrictive law in predominantly catholic italy has to do with the influence of the vatican on italian voters . voting on a moral issue has enflamed the political climate with some politicians saying the church should stop interfering in state affairs .
divorce and abortion exist in italy but it took years for those issues to become law . pope urges people to abstain for the past few weeks , supporters and opponents of the law have been fiercely campaigning in an effort to win voters to their respective camps .
top church officials , including the pope himself , have urged voters to abstain . bildunterschrift : a poster reading " life ca n't be put on vote , choose not to vote " is seen inside a church in rome daniele capezzone , leader of the italian radical party , said he does not believe there will be a clash between lay people and catholics because italian catholics are liberals .
as in the case of divorce and abortion , they will vote for freedom of choice this time as well , he said . politicians who favor the law have urged voters to boycott the poll .
those who oppose it say a " yes " vote should be cast to improve the existing law , to guarantee the health of women and to guarantee research . piero fassino , leader of the left democrats party , said voters should not desert the polls . " going to the polls allows every opinion to be expressed , " he said .
" those who like us believe the law can be changed for the better will vote ' yes , ' those who want to keep it the way it is can vote ' no , ' and those who want to abstain also have that option . " but not going to the polls , he added , is abstaining without having the courage to say it . low turnout ? a recent poll says only around 40 percent of italians are sure to vote " yes " in the referendum .
in order for the vote to be valid , 50 percent plus one of eligible voters must cast their ballots .
if the quorum is not reached , the law will stay as is . former eu commissioner and radical party member emma bonino has been strongly urging italians to vote " yes " on all four questions being posed . bildunterschrift : posters in rome reading ' everybody of us is a former embryo ' , invite voters to abstain in the four referenda " women and men of this country who are responsible for their freedom , their life and their hopes for health treatment must go and vote four times ' yes , " ' she said . doctors and scientists have taken different sides in this referendum , as have women .
not all of them have campaigned for a " yes " vote , like olimpia tarsi of the committee women and life . " we do not want to block research , " she said .
" but i would like to remind everyone that stem cells are found in embryos , in the umbilical cord and in adult tissue and to this day there is no published valid scientific paper that documents that someone 's illness has been cured because of embryo stem cells . " opponents of the referendum also say the subject matter is too complicated to be voted by the general public .
they claim the matter has to be dealt with in parliament .
italy 's constitutional court cleared the way for the referendum after more than four million signatures were collected in a petition which called for the law to be repealed . sabina castelfranco -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder said mulling cloning policy switch encouraged by recent cloning successes in south korea , german chancellor gerhard schröder reportedly wants to ease restrictions on stem cell research in germany .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family . it is a teenager 's dream .
under one roof , they can find the newest video games , fashion items , cell phones and computer gadgets .
over three days , this year 's " you " youth trade fair in essen attracted 200,000 teens where they could indulge in unending fun .
they did n't have to pay for a thing .
after all , the kids have lots of money at their disposal for later purchases .
at you , corporate marketers want to etch their product into the visitors ' minds .
be it modern and high-tech or classic like coca-cola , which of course was handed out at the entrance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urbs video game one of the newest trends is event marketing .
concerts , dance and sporting events attract the teens ' attention .
a soccer tournament , " sponsored by nokia , " is just one example .
" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .

" sponsoring and sporting events are an instrument to reach adolescent target groups , " said cornelia zanger from the business department at the university of chemnitz .
" we 've found out in lots of studies that sports is also a way to bring out emotions in youths and that works also for certain products and brands . "
it 's the emotions it 's no wonder that marketers are toying with the emotions of this group .
those who see their favorite band and drink a soft drink at the concert will later associate that product with the concert 's experience .
" the product evokes the positive experience and that then makes us want to buy the product , " said hans-peter erb , a social psychologist at the university of bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would every teen girl wear what britney spears wears ?
erb explained further that people will file the experience as one " of the world being in order . "
if that is the case then we let our guard down and are more willing to succumb to the purpose of the marketing strategy .
and with this tactic , people are more susceptible to buy things they do n't really need .
erb thinks the classic example is mouthwash .
to him bad breath was something that marketers invented so that they could then offer a " cure . "
like son , like father one thing that turns teenagers off completely is an adult acting as if he or she knows what 's better for an adolescent .
" you have to let the teens come to you and explain what is ' in ' in the target group and what is good for the group , " zanger said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : younger people are usually more on top of the current computer trends it 's worth listening to teens though .
firstly , they are easier to win over as customers .
plus , youths have an extreme amount of influence over what their parents buy .
grandpa probably does n't know much about computers but his 16-year-old grandson or daughter is probably a whiz .
so he 'll just ask them what kind of computer he should buy .
the same goes for hobbies like rollerblading .
but companies are also keeping demographics in mind .
there are fewer and fewer younger people in germany so building up strong customer loyalty at an early age is vital , according to zanger .
but marketers and advertisers tread on a thin line .
the trick is not to be too pushy so that customers turn their backs and at the same time leave an indelible impression in the person 's head - particularly when there are a thousand other companies with the same goal in mind . johanna herzing -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's product placement problem product placement is a widespread promotional strategy .
but do ads disguised as content have a place in publicly funded programs ?
german public broadcaster ard seems to think so .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

the thermal oxide reprocessing plant -lrb- thorp -rrb- stopped production in april when the leak , which went undetected for up to eight months , was discovered .
sellafield 's managing director , barry snelson , admitted to the bbc that the plant may remain closed for months .
safety regulators claim the discharge could result in criminal charges .
mr snelson described the incident as " a stumble , not a fall " .
the accident happened when a narrow pipe fractured , spewing nitric acid onto the floor of a concrete-lined cell in the thorp reprocessing complex .
the acid contained 20 tonnes of uranium and 160kg of plutonium .
it is thought the pipe may have fractured in august , but the leak was not discovered until eight months later due to a combination of a faulty gauge and human error .
no staff were contaminated .
last week , sellafield was told to improve the way it discharged low level radioactive waste water into the irish sea .
environment agency inspectors issued an enforcement notice after finding its filtering system needed to be improved .
operators british nuclear group said no discharge limits had been breached and it was " committed " to improvements .

this was the predominant theme at a conference on the future of digital content held at the institute of contemporary arts in london earlier this week .
delegates heard about a world where tv and music companies would struggle to stand out in what one tv executive called " digital fog " .
but the days when an entertainment giant could largely influence what people do in their spare time are over .
" tv has moved from being a fairly passive medium into this digital era , " said simon gunning , head of interactive media at celador , the company behind who wants to be a millionaire .
" audiences expect more control and greater access to stuff , " he told the in the city interactive conference .
more than tv he highlighted new satellite channels which were a far cry from the traditional fare on tv , such as fancy a flutter , a betting channel , and avago , an interactive games channel . "
there is now an infinite choice of music and the stores are always open " danny vanemden , emi music uk " this is leading to a change in the way we interact with our telly , " said mr gunning .
it means that tv producers need to think beyond just making a show for broadcast .
instead they now had to look at ways of offering more through digital tv , mobiles or online .
" with big peak time monster formats you are looking at mass participation , " he said .
" as devices and platforms change , ways to engage the viewer change and become essential , " said mr gunning .
his comments were echoed by anthony lilley of magic lantern , which has been working on setting up a broadband documentary channel for channel four called 4docs .
" ideas jump across platforms and they mutate , " he explained .
" the experience you get is diverging not converging . "
the record industry has already had to come to terms with the digital era , largely due to the rise of the popularity of file-sharing over the internet .
in just a couple of years , there has been a sea change in the attitude towards making more music available online .
" there is now an infinite choice of music and the stores are always open , " said danny vanemden , digital media director at emi music uk .
" the changes are unprecedented . "
next generation the impact of digital extends to all forms of media , including traditional news organisations such as the bbc and the financial times .
they are operating in a world where news is everywhere and people can get their information from a multitude of sources , from established newspapers to bloggers .
" we are in the middle of a rather uncomfortable generational shift , especially in the uk , " said nigel pocklington of the financial times .
" we are shifting to a generation that has not grown up reading newspapers . "
" we are now dealing with online and digital worlds , where people get news from screens and mobile devices , " said mr pocklington .
" it is a challenge to manage that transition . "
the conference was part of in the city interactive events , which focus on digital content issues , organised by new media knowledge , not-for-profit body based at the university of westminster .

this was the predominant theme at a conference on the future of digital content held at the institute of contemporary arts in london earlier this week .
delegates heard about a world where tv and music companies would struggle to stand out in what one tv executive called " digital fog " .
but the days when an entertainment giant could largely influence what people do in their spare time are over .
" tv has moved from being a fairly passive medium into this digital era , " said simon gunning , head of interactive media at celador , the company behind who wants to be a millionaire .
" audiences expect more control and greater access to stuff , " he told the in the city interactive conference .
more than tv he highlighted new satellite channels which were a far cry from the traditional fare on tv , such as fancy a flutter , a betting channel , and avago , an interactive games channel .
there is now an infinite choice of music and the stores are always open danny vanemden , emi music uk " this is leading to a change in the way we interact with our telly , " said mr gunning .
it means that tv producers need to think beyond just making a show for broadcast .
instead they now had to look at ways of offering more through digital tv , mobiles or online .
" with big peak time monster formats you are looking at mass participation , " he said .
" as devices and platforms change , ways to engage the viewer change and become essential , " said mr gunning .
his comments were echoed by anthony lilley of magic lantern , which has been working on setting up a broadband documentary channel for channel four called 4docs .
" ideas jump across platforms and they mutate , " he explained .
" the experience you get is diverging not converging . "
the record industry has already had to come to terms with the digital era , largely due to the rise of the popularity of file-sharing over the internet .
in just a couple of years , there has been a sea change in the attitude towards making more music available online .
" there is now an infinite choice of music and the stores are always open , " said danny vanemden , digital media director at emi music uk .
" the changes are unprecedented . "
next generation the impact of digital extends to all forms of media , including traditional news organisations such as the bbc and the financial times .
mobiles are offering new ways of getting music and video they are operating in a world where news is everywhere and people can get their information from a multitude of sources , from established newspapers to bloggers .
" we are in the middle of a rather uncomfortable generational shift , especially in the uk , " said nigel pocklington of the financial times .
" we are shifting to a generation that has not grown up reading newspapers . "
" we are now dealing with online and digital worlds , where people get news from screens and mobile devices , " said mr pocklington .
" it is a challenge to manage that transition . "
the conference was part of in the city interactive events , which focus on digital content issues , organised by new media knowledge , not-for-profit body based at the university of westminster .

the line , which runs from cardiff to bridgend via llantwit major , has re-opened to serve cardiff international airport .
around £ 17m was needed to pay for the service , which includes new stations at llantwit major and rhoose .
however , there are complaints about the frequency of service and that air travellers still need a shuttle bus .
the old railway line has been shut to regular passenger services since 1964 , but has been revamped with investment from the welsh assembly government .
on friday , transport minister andrew davies performed the official re-opening at bridgend .
ceremonies were also held at new stations in llantwit major and rhoose .
mr davies said it was an historic day for transport in wales .
" the restoration of passenger services to the vale of glamorgan after 40 years represents a major milestone in the delivery of an efficient and integrated transport infrastructure for wales , " he said .
responding to criticisms that the station should have been closer to the airport , he said the terminal was on the wrong side , and so ruled out the possibility .
" to change that would be huge expense but obviously we will be working with the airport to improve services , " he added .
welsh conservatives , however , said the frequency of the service from cardiff to the airport meant its impact should not be overstated .
" with services from cardiff to the airport scheduled for just once every hour , i can not see how this will reduce the need for people to drive , " said the party 's transport spokesman alun cairns .
meanwhile , estate agents have predicted a mini-property boom in llantwit major .
staff have already begun taking inquiries from people wanting to move there - because the hourly trains will make it easier for them to live by the sea and work in cardiff .
house prices are not expected to rise substantially , but houses should sell faster , said estate agents .
