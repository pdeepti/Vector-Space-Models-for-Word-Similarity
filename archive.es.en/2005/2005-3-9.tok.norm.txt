the european union could play a pivotal role in this , he added . " i have no problem talking about ukraine 's eu ambitions , " he said .
" we 're not following a fashion .
nor are we engaging in political adventurism .

" the ukrainian people as a whole do n't want to be branded as criminals just because there were some who took advantage of the lax visa regulations in a dubious way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 09.03.2005 klinsi looks to blend experience with youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's markus babbel is one of the old guard called up for duty jürgen klinsmann 's german revolution may look to the recent past to plot success in the future as the national coach named some familiar faces in a provisional squad for germany 's next fixture in slovenia . german national coach jürgen klinsmann has left the door open for experienced internationals markus babbel and dietmar hamann to make a late bid to board the plane for the 2006 world cup . klinsmann surprised many people by including both players in a 33-man provisional squad that will be culled to 20 , for the friendly match with slovenia in celje on march 26 .
vfb stuttgart defender babbel , 32 , has not played for the german national team for five years winning the last of his 51 caps in germany 's 1-0 defeat by england in euro 2000 . a year later babbel , then at liverpool , contracted the potentially life-threatening nerve illness guillain-barre syndrome but has bounced back with bundesliga side stuttgart .
" we are very impressed how he has overcome this severe illness and become a key player at stuttgart , " explained klinsmann .
" markus will improve in the build up to the world cup and is in our thoughts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamann , left , gets a tackle in during one of germany 's ill-fated euro 2004 games .
liverpool midfielder hamann , 31 , has been overlooked by his country since the disastrous euro 2004 finals in portugal when germany failed to win a single match and crashed out at the first group stage . hamann looking for world cup swan song hamann , with over 50 caps to his name , now has the chance to show klinsmann he has one big tournament left in his ageing legs .
" hamann is an established player and when i took over he knew that he would not be picked as we wanted to take a look at younger players , " explained klinsmann . since taking over klinsmann has put an emphasis on youth handing debuts to players in their early twenties such as chelsea defender robert huth , aston villa midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and christian pander of schalke 04 . but 1990 world cup winner klinsmann knows experience is vital in big tournaments and may feel babbel and hamann can help guide his crop of inexperienced internationals . deisler ready for yet another comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sebastian deisler .
another player looking to get his international career out of the blocks once again is bayern munich 's sebastian deisler . the bayern midfielder , still struggling to make a full recovery from depression and injury , has been left out of recent german friendlies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 a fast road to nowhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next time , take the train plagued by chronic traffic jams , germany 's autobahn is often more of a long parking lot than a high-speed automotive paradise .
some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 wartburg castle : immersed in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic castle of wartburg is a popular tourist attraction it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

vfb stuttgart defender babbel , 32 , has not played for the german national team for five years winning the last of his 51 caps in germany 's 1-0 defeat by england in euro 2000 . a year later babbel , then at liverpool , contracted the potentially life-threatening nerve illness guillain-barre syndrome but has bounced back with bundesliga side stuttgart .

" hamann is an established player and when i took over he knew that he would not be picked as we wanted to take a look at younger players , " explained klinsmann . since taking over klinsmann has put an emphasis on youth handing debuts to players in their early twenties such as chelsea defender robert huth , aston villa midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and christian pander of schalke 04 . but 1990 world cup winner klinsmann knows experience is vital in big tournaments and may feel babbel and hamann can help guide his crop of inexperienced internationals . deisler ready for yet another comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sebastian deisler .
another player looking to get his international career out of the blocks once again is bayern munich 's sebastian deisler . the bayern midfielder , still struggling to make a full recovery from depression and injury , has been left out of recent german friendlies .
however , scoring recently for munich in their championship push has once again alerted klinsmann to the diminutive playmaker 's latent strengths . neuville joins list of hopeful strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville .
borussia mönchengladbach striker oliver neuville also looks set to feature in the squad , almost a year after his last internationals appearance in april 2004 . " he 's one of six strikers we 're planning on for the world cup next year , " klinsmann said , adding kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose and gerald asamoah were currently ahead of the former bayer leverkusen attacker in the forward rankings .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.03.2005 bosnia 's war crimes court starts work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors in bosnia can expect to try more war crimes cases a war crimes court starts its work wednesday in bosnia in a milestone for justice in the balkan country following the 1992-95 war that witnessed the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . the bosnian war crimes chamber in sarajevo is expected to ease the burden of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague by taking some of its caseload .
the opening ceremony on wednesday morning was attended by the president of the icty , theodor meron , and its chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . the first indictments are expected to be transferred to bosnia from the hague soon . the icty , set up by the united nations , will wind up its work in 2010 .
with some 50 suspects still awaiting trial , it will have to transfer several cases to courts in the balkans if it is to meet its target .
del ponte said in december that she had asked for the transfer of seven cases to bosnia . bosnia 's 1992-95 war claimed over 200,000 lives and saw the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paddy ashdown paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , high representative for the former yugoslav republic of bosnia , has said the establishment of the new tribunal is " a major step forward to full statehood , " proving that bosnia is finally able to try serious war crimes cases .
locals to replace internationals until now local courts in the bosnian postwar political entities - the muslim-croat federation and the serbs ' republika srpska - have been authorized to try low-profile war crimes cases only after receiving approval from the icty in the hague . the bosnian prosecutor 's office will also deal with additional war crimes cases since un prosecutors completed their own investigations last year .
initially , the chamber , part of the court of bosnia-hercegovina , will be staffed mainly by international judges and prosecutors , with local legal officers gradually taking over . four bosnian serb indictees who del ponte wants tried in bosnia have opposed the transfer of their cases from t he hague , where they are currently detained .
around 1,000 cases involving some 10,000 suspects at lower level bosnian courts will also be reviewed and cases seen as particularly sensitive would be taken over by the war crimes court . croatia 's eu hopes dampened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte on tuesday , del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- released a report again criticizing croatia for failing to adequately cooperate with the icty . " despite all public and private assurances from zagreb , ante gotovina remains within reach of the croatian authorities and until such time as he is brought to the hague , it can not be said that croatia is cooperating fully with the international tribunal . " the chief prosecutor 's negative assessment puts a damper on croatia joining the european union .
the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of gotovina 's whereabouts . kosovo leader lauded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj also on tuesday , kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned after being indicted by icty over his role as a guerrilla commander in the serbian province 's 1998-99 conflict .
he said he would report to the court on wednesday , reaping praise from the un , eu and us for his prompt compliance with the tribunal . " i assume that it was a well thought-out step and thus i hope that all those involved understand how important cooperation -lrb- with the tribunal -rrb- is , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters when asked about the developments in kosovo .
" his actions demonstrate his deep concern for the future of kosovo and its people , " us state department spokesman richard boucher said .
washington urged all parties in the balkans to arrest and extradite all hague suspects " as a prerequisite for full integration into euro-atlantic institutions . " haradinaj remains a hero to many kosovo albanians who demand independence from serbia and see him as a freedom fighter who helped liberate kosovo from serbian oppression . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia 's eu bid threatened the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid .

the opening ceremony on wednesday morning was attended by the president of the icty , theodor meron , and its chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . the first indictments are expected to be transferred to bosnia from the hague soon . the icty , set up by the united nations , will wind up its work in 2010 .
with some 50 suspects still awaiting trial , it will have to transfer several cases to courts in the balkans if it is to meet its target .
del ponte said in december that she had asked for the transfer of seven cases to bosnia . bosnia 's 1992-95 war claimed over 200,000 lives and saw the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paddy ashdown paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , high representative for the former yugoslav republic of bosnia , has said the establishment of the new tribunal is " a major step forward to full statehood , " proving that bosnia is finally able to try serious war crimes cases .
locals to replace internationals until now local courts in the bosnian postwar political entities - the muslim-croat federation and the serbs ' republika srpska - have been authorized to try low-profile war crimes cases only after receiving approval from the icty in the hague . the bosnian prosecutor 's office will also deal with additional war crimes cases since un prosecutors completed their own investigations last year .
initially , the chamber , part of the court of bosnia-hercegovina , will be staffed mainly by international judges and prosecutors , with local legal officers gradually taking over . four bosnian serb indictees who del ponte wants tried in bosnia have opposed the transfer of their cases from t he hague , where they are currently detained .
around 1,000 cases involving some 10,000 suspects at lower level bosnian courts will also be reviewed and cases seen as particularly sensitive would be taken over by the war crimes court . croatia 's eu hopes dampened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte on tuesday , del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- released a report again criticizing croatia for failing to adequately cooperate with the icty . " despite all public and private assurances from zagreb , ante gotovina remains within reach of the croatian authorities and until such time as he is brought to the hague , it can not be said that croatia is cooperating fully with the international tribunal . " the chief prosecutor 's negative assessment puts a damper on croatia joining the european union .
the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of gotovina 's whereabouts . kosovo leader lauded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj also on tuesday , kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned after being indicted by icty over his role as a guerrilla commander in the serbian province 's 1998-99 conflict .
he said he would report to the court on wednesday , reaping praise from the un , eu and us for his prompt compliance with the tribunal . " i assume that it was a well thought-out step and thus i hope that all those involved understand how important cooperation -lrb- with the tribunal -rrb- is , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters when asked about the developments in kosovo .
" his actions demonstrate his deep concern for the future of kosovo and its people , " us state department spokesman richard boucher said .
washington urged all parties in the balkans to arrest and extradite all hague suspects " as a prerequisite for full integration into euro-atlantic institutions . " haradinaj remains a hero to many kosovo albanians who demand independence from serbia and see him as a freedom fighter who helped liberate kosovo from serbian oppression . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia 's eu bid threatened the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid .

the second-leg mauling meant bremen crashed out 10-2 on aggregate . werder bremen 's dreams of champions league glory not only crumbled in lyon on tuesday night but were utterly demolished by a goal avalanche that swept the german champions away and out of the competition . thomas schaaf 's team were shown to be severely lacking in class and experience at the highest level in their first round knockout phase second leg tie by the french champions who exposed all of bremen 's frailties and then some in a 7-2 rout . the increasingly confident lyon team , progressing on the back off a 10-2 aggregate victory to their second quarter-final in as many years , breezed past a shell-shocked bremen side thanks to a hat-trick from french international sylvain wiltord , a double from ghanaian mickael essien and strikes from florent malouda and jeremie berthold . the comprehensive win soon took on the appearance of an exhibition match with the french virtually assured of a spot in the next round after a 3-0 first leg win at the weserstadion two weeks ago . flying frenchmen steam ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's sylvain wiltord , center , challenges for the ball against bremen 's ludovic magnin and fabian ernst .
lyon , boosted by the return of striker sidney govou from injury and bidding to put two domestic defeats in the past week behind them , got off to a flying start .
wiltord quickly moving forward as he did two weeks ago , opening the score once again after eight minutes from just inside the area with a pass from midfielder malouda . essien netted his first six minutes later with a left footed shot from just outside the area , and put the hosts 3-0 up after 29 minutes to the delight of the crowd at the gerland stadium . werder hit back two minutes later with frenchman johan micoud reducing the deficit when he profited from a deflected centre to beat gregory coupet .
lyon 's brazilian striker juninho had a chance of a fourth three minutes before the break but bremen 's finnish defender petri pasanen cleared . profligate strikers rue their luck croatian international striker ivan klasnic had a chance to reduce arrears for the visitors a minute after the break but sent the shot over the bar , with juninho similarly sending over a free kick from 30 meters out after 48 minutes . but once again the hosts found a gap in werder 's defense which allowed govou take off and pass to wiltord who slid the ball past beleaguered werder goalie andreas reinke after 54 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foul on midfielder frank baumann handed werder a lifeline and they scored their second after 57 minutes from a valerien ismael penalty . bremen crumble as wiltord grabs hat-trick essien missed out on a hat-trick four minutes later when he found himself alone in front of goal but reinke held firm .
but the worst was yet to come for the german goalie , as malouda struck after 60 minutes , with wiltord netting his third three minutes later with a volley from a govou pass . the wobbling germans tried to close down their defense but only aggravated the situation when lyon were handed a penalty after a foul on their brazilian striker nilmar by german international defender frank fahrenhorst , with jeremie berthod converting it after 79 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank baumann .
bremen skipper baumann missed his team 's final chance to save face when a fine shot was stopped by coupet three minutes from time to compound a miserable week for the germans who all but surrendered their domestic crown last weekend by falling to bayern munich . a tale of two coaches lyon coach paul le guen was in awe of his side 's demolition job .
" against a good side like werder we were virtually through after half-an-hour and that is unheard of in the champions league , " said the two-time winning championship coach .
" are we the favourites for the champions league ?
let them say what they like , we 'll just get on with it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf in happier times .
it left werder coach thomas schaaf completely bewildered and less than proud of his team 's efforts .
" it is unbelievably disappointing and totally unacceptable , " he said with some understatement .
" one can always lose a match , especially when one plays three strikers , but to lose by so much is just not on .
we were never there for the one on one challenges and always too far from the man with the ball . " " lyon are definitely a good team but they will never come across as easy an opponent as us . "
however schaaf said that lyon were viable candidates for the trophy .
" if they continue on this trajectory then i can not rule anything out for them . " german eyes turn to wednesday 's clashes germany 's other representatives return to champions league action on wednesday night with bayern munich traveling to london to defend a 3-1 lead against arsenal while bayer leverkusen welcome english opposition to the bayarena in the form of liverpool , looking to overturn a similar deficit inflicted in the first leg at anfield . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern qualify but bremen , bayer stumble bayern munich cruised past maccabi tel-aviv in the champions league on tuesday night to reach the knock-out phase but bayer leverkusen and werder bremen need to win their last games after drawing in their matches .

the second-leg mauling meant bremen crashed out 10-2 on aggregate . werder bremen 's dreams of champions league glory not only crumbled in lyon on tuesday night but were utterly demolished by a goal avalanche that swept the german champions away and out of the competition . thomas schaaf 's team were shown to be severely lacking in class and experience at the highest level in their first round knockout phase second leg tie by the french champions who exposed all of bremen 's frailties and then some in a 7-2 rout . the increasingly confident lyon team , progressing on the back off a 10-2 aggregate victory to their second quarter-final in as many years , breezed past a shell-shocked bremen side thanks to a hat-trick from french international sylvain wiltord , a double from ghanaian mickael essien and strikes from florent malouda and jeremie berthold . the comprehensive win soon took on the appearance of an exhibition match with the french virtually assured of a spot in the next round after a 3-0 first leg win at the weserstadion two weeks ago . flying frenchmen steam ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyon 's sylvain wiltord , center , challenges for the ball against bremen 's ludovic magnin and fabian ernst .
lyon , boosted by the return of striker sidney govou from injury and bidding to put two domestic defeats in the past week behind them , got off to a flying start .
wiltord quickly moving forward as he did two weeks ago , opening the score once again after eight minutes from just inside the area with a pass from midfielder malouda . essien netted his first six minutes later with a left footed shot from just outside the area , and put the hosts 3-0 up after 29 minutes to the delight of the crowd at the gerland stadium . werder hit back two minutes later with frenchman johan micoud reducing the deficit when he profited from a deflected centre to beat gregory coupet .
lyon 's brazilian striker juninho had a chance of a fourth three minutes before the break but bremen 's finnish defender petri pasanen cleared . profligate strikers rue their luck croatian international striker ivan klasnic had a chance to reduce arrears for the visitors a minute after the break but sent the shot over the bar , with juninho similarly sending over a free kick from 30 meters out after 48 minutes . but once again the hosts found a gap in werder 's defense which allowed govou take off and pass to wiltord who slid the ball past beleaguered werder goalie andreas reinke after 54 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a foul on midfielder frank baumann handed werder a lifeline and they scored their second after 57 minutes from a valerien ismael penalty . bremen crumble as wiltord grabs hat-trick essien missed out on a hat-trick four minutes later when he found himself alone in front of goal but reinke held firm .
but the worst was yet to come for the german goalie , as malouda struck after 60 minutes , with wiltord netting his third three minutes later with a volley from a govou pass . the wobbling germans tried to close down their defense but only aggravated the situation when lyon were handed a penalty after a foul on their brazilian striker nilmar by german international defender frank fahrenhorst , with jeremie berthod converting it after 79 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank baumann .
bremen skipper baumann missed his team 's final chance to save face when a fine shot was stopped by coupet three minutes from time to compound a miserable week for the germans who all but surrendered their domestic crown last weekend by falling to bayern munich . a tale of two coaches lyon coach paul le guen was in awe of his side 's demolition job .
" against a good side like werder we were virtually through after half-an-hour and that is unheard of in the champions league , " said the two-time winning championship coach .
" are we the favourites for the champions league ?
let them say what they like , we 'll just get on with it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf in happier times .
it left werder coach thomas schaaf completely bewildered and less than proud of his team 's efforts .
" it is unbelievably disappointing and totally unacceptable , " he said with some understatement .
" one can always lose a match , especially when one plays three strikers , but to lose by so much is just not on .
we were never there for the one on one challenges and always too far from the man with the ball . " " lyon are definitely a good team but they will never come across as easy an opponent as us . "
however schaaf said that lyon were viable candidates for the trophy .
" if they continue on this trajectory then i can not rule anything out for them . " german eyes turn to wednesday 's clashes germany 's other representatives return to champions league action on wednesday night with bayern munich traveling to london to defend a 3-1 lead against arsenal while bayer leverkusen welcome english opposition to the bayarena in the form of liverpool , looking to overturn a similar deficit inflicted in the first leg at anfield . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern qualify but bremen , bayer stumble bayern munich cruised past maccabi tel-aviv in the champions league on tuesday night to reach the knock-out phase but bayer leverkusen and werder bremen need to win their last games after drawing in their matches .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 wartburg castle : immersed in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic castle of wartburg is a popular tourist attraction it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .
demographers say from 2015 , the number of employment-aged people will begin to drop off strongly . " from about 2020 or 2025 , we are cautiously optimistic that older people will have an easier time finding work because the younger people wo n't be there anymore , " said bernd katzenstein , a spokesperson for the dia , an organization which studies trends in old age provision , such as pensions , in germany .
companies will , in effect , be forced to take on older workers . " our most recent study -lsb- on working and age -rsb- concluded with the call to companies saying ' get ready for this , because it 's coming . '
but little has been done so far , " he said . a few companies have begun thinking about the future , according to him .
big names like siemens and daimlerchrysler have begun looking at ways to manage an increasingly older work force with considerations about preventive health care , part-time work and continuing education programs . the dgb 's adamy added that a few companies are realizing that hiring older people can even be advantageous , for example in some retail branches , where older salespeople can create an atmosphere of trust with customers that a pierced and tattooed twenty-something might not . but those companies are in the minority . " right now it 's catastrophic for older people , " said katzenstein .
" all we can say is that down the road , there will be a new dawn for them . " but that 's cold comfort , since by that time , many will have already ridden off into the sunset . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

" ukraine deserves special attention , " yushchenko told a packed house .
" the world will see another ukraine , a ukraine which is stronger , healthier and economically robust and one that is not plagued by corruption .
germany understands that a new chapter of european history is being written in ukraine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by addressing the german parliament , yushchenko followed in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , but the reformist liberal 's first official visit to germany has been dogged by a continuing scandal over visas issued to immigrants from the former soviet bloc , mainly ukraine . the german opposition claims that by relaxing the criteria for issuing visas between 2000 and 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people were able to enter germany , many with the help of organised crime networks . yushchenko 's team is said to be concerned that the scandal is leading all ukrainians to be portrayed as illegal workers , or even criminals , in germany and undermining their efforts to change the country 's image . in his only reference to the visa affair , yushchenko called on germany to " support our students , artists and journalists through your visa policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes business -pipe- 09.03.2005 germany 's labor market losers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers are almost a rarity in germany , but that could change a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .
demographers say from 2015 , the number of employment-aged people will begin to drop off strongly . " from about 2020 or 2025 , we are cautiously optimistic that older people will have an easier time finding work because the younger people wo n't be there anymore , " said bernd katzenstein , a spokesperson for the dia , an organization which studies trends in old age provision , such as pensions , in germany .
companies will , in effect , be forced to take on older workers . " our most recent study -lsb- on working and age -rsb- concluded with the call to companies saying ' get ready for this , because it 's coming . '
but little has been done so far , " he said . a few companies have begun thinking about the future , according to him .
big names like siemens and daimlerchrysler have begun looking at ways to manage an increasingly older work force with considerations about preventive health care , part-time work and continuing education programs . the dgb 's adamy added that a few companies are realizing that hiring older people can even be advantageous , for example in some retail branches , where older salespeople can create an atmosphere of trust with customers that a pierced and tattooed twenty-something might not . but those companies are in the minority . " right now it 's catastrophic for older people , " said katzenstein .
" all we can say is that down the road , there will be a new dawn for them . " but that 's cold comfort , since by that time , many will have already ridden off into the sunset . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .
demographers say from 2015 , the number of employment-aged people will begin to drop off strongly . " from about 2020 or 2025 , we are cautiously optimistic that older people will have an easier time finding work because the younger people wo n't be there anymore , " said bernd katzenstein , a spokesperson for the dia , an organization which studies trends in old age provision , such as pensions , in germany .
companies will , in effect , be forced to take on older workers . " our most recent study -lsb- on working and age -rsb- concluded with the call to companies saying ' get ready for this , because it 's coming . '
but little has been done so far , " he said . a few companies have begun thinking about the future , according to him .
big names like siemens and daimlerchrysler have begun looking at ways to manage an increasingly older work force with considerations about preventive health care , part-time work and continuing education programs . the dgb 's adamy added that a few companies are realizing that hiring older people can even be advantageous , for example in some retail branches , where older salespeople can create an atmosphere of trust with customers that a pierced and tattooed twenty-something might not . but those companies are in the minority . " right now it 's catastrophic for older people , " said katzenstein .
" all we can say is that down the road , there will be a new dawn for them . " but that 's cold comfort , since by that time , many will have already ridden off into the sunset . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 a fast road to nowhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next time , take the train plagued by chronic traffic jams , germany 's autobahn is often more of a long parking lot than a high-speed automotive paradise .
some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

" ukraine deserves special attention , " yushchenko told a packed house .
" the world will see another ukraine , a ukraine which is stronger , healthier and economically robust and one that is not plagued by corruption .
germany understands that a new chapter of european history is being written in ukraine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by addressing the german parliament , yushchenko followed in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , but the reformist liberal 's first official visit to germany has been dogged by a continuing scandal over visas issued to immigrants from the former soviet bloc , mainly ukraine . the german opposition claims that by relaxing the criteria for issuing visas between 2000 and 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people were able to enter germany , many with the help of organised crime networks . yushchenko 's team is said to be concerned that the scandal is leading all ukrainians to be portrayed as illegal workers , or even criminals , in germany and undermining their efforts to change the country 's image . in his only reference to the visa affair , yushchenko called on germany to " support our students , artists and journalists through your visa policy . " the eu track continuing the theme of his two-day visit , yushchenko said ukraine 's future lay in the european union and he called for his country to be given swift membership in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our road map lies down the route towards the european union , " he said , borrowing a term from the middle east peace process .
" i see ukraine in a unified europe in the not-too-distant future . "
he said he predicts his country will enter the eu as a full member well before 2016 , but that view is seen with some scepticism in brussels . for his part , chancellor schröder refused to set any timetable for ukrainian eu membership , saying that was up to the european commission . he added that ukraine 's attempts to move closer to the eu and nato should not be seen as a slight to its neighbour and former master . " russia is our eternal strategic partner , " he said . change promised seeking to demonstrate that ukraine was on the road to change , yushchenko promised to solve the brutal murder of ukrainian opposition journalist georgy gongadze , whose headless corpse was found two months after he disappeared in september 2000 . " four years after it happened , we will arrest gongadze 's murderers and bring them to justice , " yushchenko said . as yushchenko was speaking in berlin , ukrainian prosecutors announced that former president leonid kuchma would be questioned as part of the investigation .
kuchma denies any involvement in the killing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and chancellor gerhard schröder german chancellor gerhard schroeder said after talks with yushchenko earlier on wednesday that germany was throwing its weight behind efforts to help ukraine emerge from its former isolation . " we intend to support ukraine 's desire to be accorded the status of market economy by the european union as quickly as possible and naturally we are committed to assisting ukraine to become a member of the world trade organization , " schroeder added . germany is ukraine 's second biggest trading partner after russia . the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election last year , which produced a victory for the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovych but was marred by widespread reports of irregularities , was a severe test of schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- yushchenko to make high-profile visit to germany ukraine 's president yushchenko visits germany next week for talks with schröder and a speech in parliament .
the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany .

" ukraine deserves special attention , " yushchenko told a packed house .
" the world will see another ukraine , a ukraine which is stronger , healthier and economically robust and one that is not plagued by corruption .
germany understands that a new chapter of european history is being written in ukraine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by addressing the german parliament , yushchenko followed in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , but the reformist liberal 's first official visit to germany has been dogged by a continuing scandal over visas issued to immigrants from the former soviet bloc , mainly ukraine . the german opposition claims that by relaxing the criteria for issuing visas between 2000 and 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people were able to enter germany , many with the help of organised crime networks . yushchenko 's team is said to be concerned that the scandal is leading all ukrainians to be portrayed as illegal workers , or even criminals , in germany and undermining their efforts to change the country 's image . in his only reference to the visa affair , yushchenko called on germany to " support our students , artists and journalists through your visa policy . " the eu track continuing the theme of his two-day visit , yushchenko said ukraine 's future lay in the european union and he called for his country to be given swift membership in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our road map lies down the route towards the european union , " he said , borrowing a term from the middle east peace process .
" i see ukraine in a unified europe in the not-too-distant future . "
he said he predicts his country will enter the eu as a full member well before 2016 , but that view is seen with some scepticism in brussels . for his part , chancellor schröder refused to set any timetable for ukrainian eu membership , saying that was up to the european commission . he added that ukraine 's attempts to move closer to the eu and nato should not be seen as a slight to its neighbour and former master . " russia is our eternal strategic partner , " he said . change promised seeking to demonstrate that ukraine was on the road to change , yushchenko promised to solve the brutal murder of ukrainian opposition journalist georgy gongadze , whose headless corpse was found two months after he disappeared in september 2000 . " four years after it happened , we will arrest gongadze 's murderers and bring them to justice , " yushchenko said . as yushchenko was speaking in berlin , ukrainian prosecutors announced that former president leonid kuchma would be questioned as part of the investigation .
kuchma denies any involvement in the killing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and chancellor gerhard schröder german chancellor gerhard schroeder said after talks with yushchenko earlier on wednesday that germany was throwing its weight behind efforts to help ukraine emerge from its former isolation . " we intend to support ukraine 's desire to be accorded the status of market economy by the european union as quickly as possible and naturally we are committed to assisting ukraine to become a member of the world trade organization , " schroeder added . germany is ukraine 's second biggest trading partner after russia . the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election last year , which produced a victory for the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovych but was marred by widespread reports of irregularities , was a severe test of schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.03.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc premiere pay-tv ipo successful shares in premiere , germany 's only pay-television channel , began trading on the stock exchange in frankfurt at a price of € 30.50 -lrb- $ 40.73 -rrb- on wednesday , way above the issue price of € 28 . the high starting price had been expected given the strong demand for premiere shares in its initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- .
the issue was 12.3 times oversubscribed and raised a total € 1.179 billion for premiere , which it said it would use to cut debt .
the company issued a total 42.1 million shares in all at a price of € 28 .
about 12 million of the shares came from a capital increase and existing shareholders offered 24.6 million of their own shares .
an additional 5.5 million shares was issued in a so-called " greenshoe " or over-allotment option given the strong demand for the share .
the ipo was one of the biggest stock market listings in germany this year and the biggest ipo ever in the german media sector .

the opening ceremony on wednesday morning was attended by the president of the icty , theodor meron , and its chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . the first indictments are expected to be transferred to bosnia from the hague soon . the icty , set up by the united nations , will wind up its work in 2010 .
with some 50 suspects still awaiting trial , it will have to transfer several cases to courts in the balkans if it is to meet its target .
del ponte said in december that she had asked for the transfer of seven cases to bosnia . bosnia 's 1992-95 war claimed over 200,000 lives and saw the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paddy ashdown paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , high representative for the former yugoslav republic of bosnia , has said the establishment of the new tribunal is " a major step forward to full statehood , " proving that bosnia is finally able to try serious war crimes cases .
locals to replace internationals until now local courts in the bosnian postwar political entities - the muslim-croat federation and the serbs ' republika srpska - have been authorized to try low-profile war crimes cases only after receiving approval from the icty in the hague . the bosnian prosecutor 's office will also deal with additional war crimes cases since un prosecutors completed their own investigations last year .
initially , the chamber , part of the court of bosnia-hercegovina , will be staffed mainly by international judges and prosecutors , with local legal officers gradually taking over . four bosnian serb indictees who del ponte wants tried in bosnia have opposed the transfer of their cases from t he hague , where they are currently detained .
around 1,000 cases involving some 10,000 suspects at lower level bosnian courts will also be reviewed and cases seen as particularly sensitive would be taken over by the war crimes court . croatia 's eu hopes dampened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte on tuesday , del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- released a report again criticizing croatia for failing to adequately cooperate with the icty . " despite all public and private assurances from zagreb , ante gotovina remains within reach of the croatian authorities and until such time as he is brought to the hague , it can not be said that croatia is cooperating fully with the international tribunal . " the chief prosecutor 's negative assessment puts a damper on croatia joining the european union .
the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of gotovina 's whereabouts . kosovo leader lauded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj also on tuesday , kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned after being indicted by icty over his role as a guerrilla commander in the serbian province 's 1998-99 conflict .
he said he would report to the court on wednesday , reaping praise from the un , eu and us for his prompt compliance with the tribunal . " i assume that it was a well thought-out step and thus i hope that all those involved understand how important cooperation -lrb- with the tribunal -rrb- is , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters when asked about the developments in kosovo .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .

but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .

such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 wartburg castle : immersed in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic castle of wartburg is a popular tourist attraction it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .

" ukraine deserves special attention , " yushchenko told a packed house .
" the world will see another ukraine , a ukraine which is stronger , healthier and economically robust and one that is not plagued by corruption .
germany understands that a new chapter of european history is being written in ukraine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by addressing the german parliament , yushchenko followed in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , but the reformist liberal 's first official visit to germany has been dogged by a continuing scandal over visas issued to immigrants from the former soviet bloc , mainly ukraine . the german opposition claims that by relaxing the criteria for issuing visas between 2000 and 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people were able to enter germany , many with the help of organised crime networks . yushchenko 's team is said to be concerned that the scandal is leading all ukrainians to be portrayed as illegal workers , or even criminals , in germany and undermining their efforts to change the country 's image . in his only reference to the visa affair , yushchenko called on germany to " support our students , artists and journalists through your visa policy . " the eu track continuing the theme of his two-day visit , yushchenko said ukraine 's future lay in the european union and he called for his country to be given swift membership in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our road map lies down the route towards the european union , " he said , borrowing a term from the middle east peace process .
" i see ukraine in a unified europe in the not-too-distant future . "
he said he predicts his country will enter the eu as a full member well before 2016 , but that view is seen with some scepticism in brussels . for his part , chancellor schröder refused to set any timetable for ukrainian eu membership , saying that was up to the european commission . he added that ukraine 's attempts to move closer to the eu and nato should not be seen as a slight to its neighbour and former master . " russia is our eternal strategic partner , " he said . change promised seeking to demonstrate that ukraine was on the road to change , yushchenko promised to solve the brutal murder of ukrainian opposition journalist georgy gongadze , whose headless corpse was found two months after he disappeared in september 2000 . " four years after it happened , we will arrest gongadze 's murderers and bring them to justice , " yushchenko said . as yushchenko was speaking in berlin , ukrainian prosecutors announced that former president leonid kuchma would be questioned as part of the investigation .
kuchma denies any involvement in the killing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and chancellor gerhard schröder german chancellor gerhard schroeder said after talks with yushchenko earlier on wednesday that germany was throwing its weight behind efforts to help ukraine emerge from its former isolation . " we intend to support ukraine 's desire to be accorded the status of market economy by the european union as quickly as possible and naturally we are committed to assisting ukraine to become a member of the world trade organization , " schroeder added . germany is ukraine 's second biggest trading partner after russia . the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election last year , which produced a victory for the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovych but was marred by widespread reports of irregularities , was a severe test of schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .
demographers say from 2015 , the number of employment-aged people will begin to drop off strongly . " from about 2020 or 2025 , we are cautiously optimistic that older people will have an easier time finding work because the younger people wo n't be there anymore , " said bernd katzenstein , a spokesperson for the dia , an organization which studies trends in old age provision , such as pensions , in germany .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .

the opening ceremony on wednesday morning was attended by the president of the icty , theodor meron , and its chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . the first indictments are expected to be transferred to bosnia from the hague soon . the icty , set up by the united nations , will wind up its work in 2010 .
with some 50 suspects still awaiting trial , it will have to transfer several cases to courts in the balkans if it is to meet its target .
del ponte said in december that she had asked for the transfer of seven cases to bosnia . bosnia 's 1992-95 war claimed over 200,000 lives and saw the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paddy ashdown paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , high representative for the former yugoslav republic of bosnia , has said the establishment of the new tribunal is " a major step forward to full statehood , " proving that bosnia is finally able to try serious war crimes cases .
locals to replace internationals until now local courts in the bosnian postwar political entities - the muslim-croat federation and the serbs ' republika srpska - have been authorized to try low-profile war crimes cases only after receiving approval from the icty in the hague . the bosnian prosecutor 's office will also deal with additional war crimes cases since un prosecutors completed their own investigations last year .
initially , the chamber , part of the court of bosnia-hercegovina , will be staffed mainly by international judges and prosecutors , with local legal officers gradually taking over . four bosnian serb indictees who del ponte wants tried in bosnia have opposed the transfer of their cases from t he hague , where they are currently detained .
around 1,000 cases involving some 10,000 suspects at lower level bosnian courts will also be reviewed and cases seen as particularly sensitive would be taken over by the war crimes court . croatia 's eu hopes dampened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte on tuesday , del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- released a report again criticizing croatia for failing to adequately cooperate with the icty . " despite all public and private assurances from zagreb , ante gotovina remains within reach of the croatian authorities and until such time as he is brought to the hague , it can not be said that croatia is cooperating fully with the international tribunal . " the chief prosecutor 's negative assessment puts a damper on croatia joining the european union .
the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of gotovina 's whereabouts . kosovo leader lauded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj also on tuesday , kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned after being indicted by icty over his role as a guerrilla commander in the serbian province 's 1998-99 conflict .
he said he would report to the court on wednesday , reaping praise from the un , eu and us for his prompt compliance with the tribunal . " i assume that it was a well thought-out step and thus i hope that all those involved understand how important cooperation -lrb- with the tribunal -rrb- is , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters when asked about the developments in kosovo .
" his actions demonstrate his deep concern for the future of kosovo and its people , " us state department spokesman richard boucher said .
washington urged all parties in the balkans to arrest and extradite all hague suspects " as a prerequisite for full integration into euro-atlantic institutions . " haradinaj remains a hero to many kosovo albanians who demand independence from serbia and see him as a freedom fighter who helped liberate kosovo from serbian oppression . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia 's eu bid threatened the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid .

but following the so-called orange revolution , yushchenko wanted to live up to his promises and turn ukraine into a more prosperous and democratic nation , he said .
the european union could play a pivotal role in this , he added . " i have no problem talking about ukraine 's eu ambitions , " he said .
" we 're not following a fashion .
nor are we engaging in political adventurism .
but we clearly say that we want to go where economic and social standards are highest and democracy is not a hollow phrase .
our people fully understand that we 've got a long way ahead of us to achieve such standards at home , but we 're poised to get going . "
return to a " normal relationship " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : foreign minister joschka fischer yushchenko also touched on the so-called " visa affair " surrounding german foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer stands accused of having aided the influx into germany of illegal workers and prostitutes from ukraine and elsewhere in eastern europe through extremely lax visa regulations at german embassies between 1999 and 2001 .
yushchenko said his country played no part in the affair , but had suffered from being put in a bad light abroad . " i believe that the visa affair will continue to have a negative psychological effect on our bilateral relations , " he said .
" the ukrainian people as a whole do n't want to be branded as criminals just because there were some who took advantage of the lax visa regulations in a dubious way . " he said ukraine would help germany to rectify the problem however it could , but that it was time to return to a " normal relationship . " " we can not afford to let the visa affair have an impact on our scientific , cultural and student exchange programs , " he said .
" the same goes for journalists who should not require a standard visa to go to germany or ukraine . " a rare honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko will address the bundestag wednesday on wednesday , yushchenko is set to meet german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
but the highlight of his visit will be his much-awaited address to the german parliament on the same day . following a lengthy , controversial debate among mainstream german parliamentarians , the go-ahead for yushchenko to speak before the bundestag was given only a few days ago .
it 's meant to be a signal that germany stands behind the president 's reform endeavors . addressing the bundestag is a rare honor for foreign statesmen .
yushchenko will follow in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and more recently russian president vladimir putin . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yushchenko to push eu case in germany at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

" ukraine deserves special attention , " yushchenko told a packed house .
" the world will see another ukraine , a ukraine which is stronger , healthier and economically robust and one that is not plagued by corruption .
germany understands that a new chapter of european history is being written in ukraine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by addressing the german parliament , yushchenko followed in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , but the reformist liberal 's first official visit to germany has been dogged by a continuing scandal over visas issued to immigrants from the former soviet bloc , mainly ukraine . the german opposition claims that by relaxing the criteria for issuing visas between 2000 and 2003 , hundreds of thousands of people were able to enter germany , many with the help of organised crime networks . yushchenko 's team is said to be concerned that the scandal is leading all ukrainians to be portrayed as illegal workers , or even criminals , in germany and undermining their efforts to change the country 's image . in his only reference to the visa affair , yushchenko called on germany to " support our students , artists and journalists through your visa policy . " the eu track continuing the theme of his two-day visit , yushchenko said ukraine 's future lay in the european union and he called for his country to be given swift membership in the european bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our road map lies down the route towards the european union , " he said , borrowing a term from the middle east peace process .
" i see ukraine in a unified europe in the not-too-distant future . "
he said he predicts his country will enter the eu as a full member well before 2016 , but that view is seen with some scepticism in brussels . for his part , chancellor schröder refused to set any timetable for ukrainian eu membership , saying that was up to the european commission . he added that ukraine 's attempts to move closer to the eu and nato should not be seen as a slight to its neighbour and former master . " russia is our eternal strategic partner , " he said . change promised seeking to demonstrate that ukraine was on the road to change , yushchenko promised to solve the brutal murder of ukrainian opposition journalist georgy gongadze , whose headless corpse was found two months after he disappeared in september 2000 . " four years after it happened , we will arrest gongadze 's murderers and bring them to justice , " yushchenko said . as yushchenko was speaking in berlin , ukrainian prosecutors announced that former president leonid kuchma would be questioned as part of the investigation .
kuchma denies any involvement in the killing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and chancellor gerhard schröder german chancellor gerhard schroeder said after talks with yushchenko earlier on wednesday that germany was throwing its weight behind efforts to help ukraine emerge from its former isolation . " we intend to support ukraine 's desire to be accorded the status of market economy by the european union as quickly as possible and naturally we are committed to assisting ukraine to become a member of the world trade organization , " schroeder added . germany is ukraine 's second biggest trading partner after russia . the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election last year , which produced a victory for the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovych but was marred by widespread reports of irregularities , was a severe test of schröder 's close relationship with russian president vladimir putin . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine 's president stresses aim to join eu at the start of his first official visit to germany since taking office as ukraine 's president , viktor yushchenko emphasized in a dw interview that he sees his country 's future in the european union .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .

such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 wartburg castle : immersed in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic castle of wartburg is a popular tourist attraction it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .

one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .

a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .

such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

the opening ceremony on wednesday morning was attended by the president of the icty , theodor meron , and its chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . the first indictments are expected to be transferred to bosnia from the hague soon . the icty , set up by the united nations , will wind up its work in 2010 .
with some 50 suspects still awaiting trial , it will have to transfer several cases to courts in the balkans if it is to meet its target .
del ponte said in december that she had asked for the transfer of seven cases to bosnia . bosnia 's 1992-95 war claimed over 200,000 lives and saw the worst atrocities in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paddy ashdown paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , high representative for the former yugoslav republic of bosnia , has said the establishment of the new tribunal is " a major step forward to full statehood , " proving that bosnia is finally able to try serious war crimes cases .
locals to replace internationals until now local courts in the bosnian postwar political entities - the muslim-croat federation and the serbs ' republika srpska - have been authorized to try low-profile war crimes cases only after receiving approval from the icty in the hague . the bosnian prosecutor 's office will also deal with additional war crimes cases since un prosecutors completed their own investigations last year .
initially , the chamber , part of the court of bosnia-hercegovina , will be staffed mainly by international judges and prosecutors , with local legal officers gradually taking over . four bosnian serb indictees who del ponte wants tried in bosnia have opposed the transfer of their cases from t he hague , where they are currently detained .
around 1,000 cases involving some 10,000 suspects at lower level bosnian courts will also be reviewed and cases seen as particularly sensitive would be taken over by the war crimes court . croatia 's eu hopes dampened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte on tuesday , del ponte -lrb- photo -rrb- released a report again criticizing croatia for failing to adequately cooperate with the icty . " despite all public and private assurances from zagreb , ante gotovina remains within reach of the croatian authorities and until such time as he is brought to the hague , it can not be said that croatia is cooperating fully with the international tribunal . " the chief prosecutor 's negative assessment puts a damper on croatia joining the european union .
the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .
zagreb has insisted it has no knowledge of gotovina 's whereabouts . kosovo leader lauded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramush haradinaj also on tuesday , kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj -lrb- photo -rrb- resigned after being indicted by icty over his role as a guerrilla commander in the serbian province 's 1998-99 conflict .
he said he would report to the court on wednesday , reaping praise from the un , eu and us for his prompt compliance with the tribunal . " i assume that it was a well thought-out step and thus i hope that all those involved understand how important cooperation -lrb- with the tribunal -rrb- is , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters when asked about the developments in kosovo .
" his actions demonstrate his deep concern for the future of kosovo and its people , " us state department spokesman richard boucher said .
washington urged all parties in the balkans to arrest and extradite all hague suspects " as a prerequisite for full integration into euro-atlantic institutions . " haradinaj remains a hero to many kosovo albanians who demand independence from serbia and see him as a freedom fighter who helped liberate kosovo from serbian oppression . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de croatia 's eu bid threatened the european union has accused croatia of deliberately failing to act to arrest a fugitive general whose fate is central to the country 's eu membership bid .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .
demographers say from 2015 , the number of employment-aged people will begin to drop off strongly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes business -pipe- 09.03.2005 germany 's labor market losers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers are almost a rarity in germany , but that could change a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .

which ? says that deal struck between the three entities is anti-competitive and puts soccer fans in the britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as meaning they will incur additional and unnecessary costs . tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament can be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 - or via a german bank account .
fans who do not use these methods of payment will not have their applications for tickets processed . an end to competition law breaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consumer group is calling on the european commission to force fifa to scrap this ticketing policy and allow people to pay by whichever method they choose .
" we are urging the european commission to honor the pledge it made when a similar breach was alleged during the 1998 world cup in france .
unless it takes action european competition laws will be breached again and again , " phil evans of which ? said in a statement . in a report published by the british daily the independent , philippe ruttley , a partner at the law firm clyde & co , said : " the ticket sales arrangements for the 2006 world cup discriminate against football fans not situated in germany and force them to buy tickets initially through an exclusive route controlled by a single credit card operator - unless they hold a bank account in germany or are prepared to carry out a bank transfer requiring additional expense .
such conditions are plainly unfair and discriminate against non-german eu football fans . " ticketing scheme fair , says fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa responded by saying that it had taken " great care in ensuring that its activities are in line with european competition law " .
it also denied that its ticketing policy was unfair .
" there are genuine , fair and internationally-accepted alternative payment methods available , and no-one will have a lesser chance of acquiring a ticket if they do not have a mastercard , " it said in a statement . in the first round of ticket sales , fans must buy tickets through fifa using either the bank transfer option or their mastercard .
in the following rounds , fans will be allowed to buy tickets using their preferred methods of payment through their national soccer associations . while fifa stresses that alternative payment options will be available in the next phase , which ? is concerned that by then most of the best tickets will have been sold . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes business -pipe- 09.03.2005 germany 's labor market losers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older workers are almost a rarity in germany , but that could change a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end . although he has some 20 years work as a plumber on large commercial buildings behind him , 47-year-old andreas dienelt is installing curtain rods and hooking up washing machines in private apartments these days .
he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .
" on the one hand , they think that people over 45 or 50 wo n't be effective employees or that they wo n't be able to come to grips with new technologies . " the result of those prejudices is a high rate of unemployment among germany 's older , but still working-age population .
every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .

he makes about € 10 -lrb- $ 13.40 -rrb- an hour doing this occasional under-the-table work , which helps supplement the unemployment benefits he receives from the state . after his firm laid him off in 2002 , dienelt entered into a program to retrain as a facility manager .
but he still has n't found work and , at this point , is n't very optimistic he ever will . " my age is working against me , i 'm sure of that , " he said .
" no one wants to hire you after you 've passed 40 . " fear of gray dienelt 's opinion is backed up by a study conducted this month by the institute of work and technology -lrb- iat -rrb- , based in the city of gelsenkirchen .
the institute found that only 54 percent companies they asked were willing to employee people over the age of 50 . just under one-third said they would hire an older worker only if the state paid them some sort of allowance for doing so .
fifteen percent of those surveyed said " as a basic principle " they would not offer jobs to applicants over the half-century mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are prejudices that exist in many personnel departments in germany , " said wilhelm adamy , head of the labor policy department at the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- .

every fourth unemployed individual in germany is over 50 .
only around 38 percent of german citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 are employed , much lower than the average in industrialized countries , which is around 50 percent .
germany 's northern neighbor denmark manages to keep 57 percent of its over-50 population employed , and sweden can boast that 68 percent of its 50-plus group is working . but in germany , with an unemployment rate topping 12 percent and jobless levels reaching 20.5 percent in the eastern part of the country , employers can pick and choose who they want to hire .
they generally reach for the fresh face and steer clear of the wrinkles . " they want a team which is ready for the olympics , so to speak .
they 're afraid of older workers being sick and out a lot , " said adamy . early retirement he and several other experts blame part of the problem on the german government 's long-standing policy of subsidizing early retirement schemes , which had the effect of pushing older workers out of the job market when they were in their 50s .
they were often replaced by younger workers who earned less , and thereby helped keep company personnel costs down . but the result of that strategy has been to put enormous pressure on germany 's already struggling social welfare system , since the government was paying for the lion 's share of early retirement packages , not the companies where the retirees had been employed .
as of 2006 , the government will end this subsidy , which will mean those employed will likely stay on the job until the retirement age , currently at 65 , but that is a number which is likely to rise in the future . forced to change although the labor pool now allows companies to indulge in their dorian gray proclivities and keep their staffs forever young , demographic changes could mean the blush of youth will soon fade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a graying society and the number of older , retired individuals will soon outpace the number youngsters entering the work force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 a fast road to nowhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next time , take the train plagued by chronic traffic jams , germany 's autobahn is often more of a long parking lot than a high-speed automotive paradise .
some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam ! " rafael heiling -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a real killer commute do you face a tough daily ride to work , spend hours stuck in a traffic jam ?
if so , your health could be in danger according to a german medical study which lends new meaning to the concept of a " killer commute . "

more freeways are needed , but their construction remains controversial and expensive .

while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .

some scientists are hoping to explain the hassle of stop-and-go with physics and game theory . traffic jams do n't discriminate .
regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

regardless whether you 're a ceo or a plumber , if you 're stuck on the highway at one of germany 's classic chokepoints like lotte-osnabrück or swisttal-heimertsheim , you 're stuck no matter what your station in life .
and if you 're sitting still on a stretch of the supposedly mighty autobahn instead of whizzing along at 200 kph , you may wonder why . it 's certainly not by chance as some may think . " around 80 percent of traffic jams occur because there are simply too many people on the same part of the road at the same time , " said michael schreckenberg , a professor of traffic physics at the university of duisburg-essen . as happens every year at the start of the summer holidays when thousands of german drivers head south , all it takes is for one of them to slam on the brakes just a bit too zealously for smooth-flowing traffic to implode . " those behind brake even harder and it just continues on down the line , " said peter wagner , head of the traffic it department of the german institute for aerospace .
" the people way in the rear will end up completely stopped . " the masses effectively end up not only stopped , but moving slower overall , said schreckenberg .
speeds of 15 kph are all it takes to cause jams on germany 's autobahn .
a good case of road rage comes on a lot faster , since the traffic backup grows quickly with new victims in the rear approaching faster than those up front can get clear . on-ramp horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad enough are the bottlenecks near construction sites or accidents .
but worst of all are the highway on-ramps , where a gaggle of cars wants to join the flow of traffic .
schreckenberg said the whole process is like breathing : " it 's a periodical phenomenon .
the system breathes in cars and breathes out traffic jams . " there are already plenty of scientists who want to understand traffic jams in order to be able to predict where there might be trouble .
some researchers have even compared autos to physical particles .
" as long as there 's enough space , they move more or less freely like a gas , " explained wagner .
" if i increase the pressure they begin to flow like a liquid .
only with even higher pressure will they , so to say , freeze . " and apparently gas particles hate bumping into each other as much as autobahn drivers .
but the comparison only goes so far .
" there are people sitting in cars , not particles , " said schreckenberg .
" they react differently , such as braking sooner or later . " they also , unfortunately , think .
if automatic traffic signs call for a speed limit of 60 to keep things flowing , the crafty drivers will often go 80 , said wagner .
" that does n't get rid of the slowdown but at least they 're out in front . " get off the road to ease pressure on the autobahn , drivers actually need to head to an off-ramp and move on to surface streets , said martin treiber , who works on traffic modelling at the dresden 's technical university .
" of course , that would n't do much for them , but it would help the autobahn speed up .
it 's a game theory problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , nobody is altruistic enough to actually get off the highway for others , but potential detours are often quickly overloaded anyway .
that 's why wagner likes a " cellular-automation-approach " when looking at traffic jams .
it essentially cuts the road into a grid and allots one cell to each car .
if a cell is full , another car can not move ahead until it is empty .
it calculates that if 1,800 cars roll through a cell in one lane in an hour , things will grind to a halt . apparently germans spend on average 58 hours a year sitting in traffic .
a bmw study said such gridlock costs the economy € 100 million each year , not including the cost to your nerves . but schreckenberg said germans are traffic wimps compared to other countries .
" we complain all the time , but if you look at seoul , istanbul or tokyo - with things routinely backed up over 10 kilometers - now that 's a traffic jam !

the country was due to begin entry talks on march 17 , but the eu has suggested the start of negotiations is contingent on zagreb complying with the icty 's demands .
eu ambassadors were expected to discuss how to proceed on thursday . gotovina was indicted by the hague-based un tribunal for war crimes against ethnic serbs at the end of croatia 's 1991-95 war .

vfb stuttgart defender babbel , 32 , has not played for the german national team for five years winning the last of his 51 caps in germany 's 1-0 defeat by england in euro 2000 . a year later babbel , then at liverpool , contracted the potentially life-threatening nerve illness guillain-barre syndrome but has bounced back with bundesliga side stuttgart .
" we are very impressed how he has overcome this severe illness and become a key player at stuttgart , " explained klinsmann .

" hamann is an established player and when i took over he knew that he would not be picked as we wanted to take a look at younger players , " explained klinsmann . since taking over klinsmann has put an emphasis on youth handing debuts to players in their early twenties such as chelsea defender robert huth , aston villa midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and christian pander of schalke 04 . but 1990 world cup winner klinsmann knows experience is vital in big tournaments and may feel babbel and hamann can help guide his crop of inexperienced internationals . deisler ready for yet another comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sebastian deisler .
another player looking to get his international career out of the blocks once again is bayern munich 's sebastian deisler . the bayern midfielder , still struggling to make a full recovery from depression and injury , has been left out of recent german friendlies .
however , scoring recently for munich in their championship push has once again alerted klinsmann to the diminutive playmaker 's latent strengths . neuville joins list of hopeful strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville .
borussia mönchengladbach striker oliver neuville also looks set to feature in the squad , almost a year after his last internationals appearance in april 2004 . " he 's one of six strikers we 're planning on for the world cup next year , " klinsmann said , adding kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose and gerald asamoah were currently ahead of the former bayer leverkusen attacker in the forward rankings .

vfb stuttgart defender babbel , 32 , has not played for the german national team for five years winning the last of his 51 caps in germany 's 1-0 defeat by england in euro 2000 . a year later babbel , then at liverpool , contracted the potentially life-threatening nerve illness guillain-barre syndrome but has bounced back with bundesliga side stuttgart .

" hamann is an established player and when i took over he knew that he would not be picked as we wanted to take a look at younger players , " explained klinsmann . since taking over klinsmann has put an emphasis on youth handing debuts to players in their early twenties such as chelsea defender robert huth , aston villa midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and christian pander of schalke 04 . but 1990 world cup winner klinsmann knows experience is vital in big tournaments and may feel babbel and hamann can help guide his crop of inexperienced internationals . deisler ready for yet another comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's sebastian deisler .
another player looking to get his international career out of the blocks once again is bayern munich 's sebastian deisler . the bayern midfielder , still struggling to make a full recovery from depression and injury , has been left out of recent german friendlies .
however , scoring recently for munich in their championship push has once again alerted klinsmann to the diminutive playmaker 's latent strengths . neuville joins list of hopeful strikers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver neuville .
borussia mönchengladbach striker oliver neuville also looks set to feature in the squad , almost a year after his last internationals appearance in april 2004 . " he 's one of six strikers we 're planning on for the world cup next year , " klinsmann said , adding kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose and gerald asamoah were currently ahead of the former bayer leverkusen attacker in the forward rankings .

but following the so-called orange revolution , yushchenko wanted to live up to his promises and turn ukraine into a more prosperous and democratic nation , he said .
the european union could play a pivotal role in this , he added . " i have no problem talking about ukraine 's eu ambitions , " he said .
" we 're not following a fashion .
nor are we engaging in political adventurism .

fischer stands accused of having aided the influx into germany of illegal workers and prostitutes from ukraine and elsewhere in eastern europe through extremely lax visa regulations at german embassies between 1999 and 2001 .
yushchenko said his country played no part in the affair , but had suffered from being put in a bad light abroad . " i believe that the visa affair will continue to have a negative psychological effect on our bilateral relations , " he said .
" the ukrainian people as a whole do n't want to be branded as criminals just because there were some who took advantage of the lax visa regulations in a dubious way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 09.03.2005 wartburg castle : immersed in history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic castle of wartburg is a popular tourist attraction it has been called the most german of all castles .
but to see the wartburg , tourists have to be ready for a tough climb up the steep road leading to the castle .
the view , however , is worth the effort . nestled in the thuringian forest , the wartburg castle rises majestically 400 meters above a rock plateau overlooking the town of eisenach in the former communist east germany .
with its thousand-year-old history , the medieval fortress can look back on quite a tumultuous past .
according to legend , knight graf ludwig founded the castle as early as 1067 , but the first historical recording didn ’ t appear until 1080 when bruno , bishop of merseburg , mentioned the impressive edifice in his writings .
historians believe construction of the wartburg ’ s main building , which forms the essence of the castle , began in 1155 .
at the time the castle was unique – one of a kind and well-known throughout the region .
today , the wartburg is one of the best preserved romanesque castles north of the alps .
if only walls could talk the thick walls of the fortress could tell many tales from the numerous times the wartburg has been the arena for historical events .
one legend says the castle was the venue for the minnesingers ’ contest or “ singers war ” in 1206 when six musicians -lrb- among them wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide -rrb- gathered to entertain the lord of the castle , hermann i. after a fight broke out over who sang the best songs , meister klingsor , a renowned minstrel in the region , was called in to settle the dispute by deciding who was the worst singer .
the one who was deemed the least musical was sentenced to death by hanging .
but as so often in historic epics , meister klingsor ruled there was no loser and the war of the singers ended peacefully .
the wartburg is perhaps best known through its connection to the german church reformer martin luther who sought refuge in the castle in 1521 after he was excommunicated by the pope and outlawed by the emperor for undermining catholic doctrine with his 95 theses .
during his long months of hiding , luther translated the new testament from the original greek into german , which today is still the basis for the modern german bible .
for more than a hundred years after luther left the wartburg , tourists have flocked to the castle to see the sparsely furnished parlor where the founder of the reformation lived and worked . in 1777 , germany ’ s most famous writer , johann wolfgang von goethe , stayed at the wartburg castle for five weeks during which time he explored the idyllic landscape of the thuringian forest and recorded the images of the now much-deteriorated castle in several drawings .
on oct .
18 , 1817 , some 500 students gathered at the castle for the “ wartburgfest , ” the first democratic public demonstration in the not-yet united germany .
under the motto , “ honor , freedom , fatherland , ” the students proclaimed their commitment to a free and united germany .
a world heritage site over the centuries , the castle fell into disuse and deterioration .
it wasn ’ t until the mid-1950s that extensive reconstruction took place inside the castle .
under the oversight of the communist german democratic republic the main building was restored to its romanesque style .
today the castle 's oldest building , the palace built in the 12th century 's late romanesque period , is used for music concerts .
a museum on the castle grounds displays art treasures collected over centuries , including tapestries , medieval musical instruments and valuable silverware .
in 1999 unesco designated the wartburg castle a world heritage site . dw staff -lrb- nk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : following the footsteps of enlightenment eisleben , eisenach , erfurt and wittenberg in eastern germany all have something in common : they were stations in the spiritual journey of 15th century protestant theologian martin luther .

mr thaksin was formally voted into office by the house of representatives on wednesday .
his governing party won a landslide victory in elections last month , and there is great curiosity as to how he will exercise his enlarged mandate .
the governing party won so many seats in parliament that the opposition will have to work to be heard .
but on tuesday , there was an encouraging sign of life from one of thailand 's other institutions .
critics of mr thaksin have warned that with so much power there is no check on his control over the country .
but the judiciary begs to differ .
the country 's supreme court has upheld a ruling against a business group owned by mr thaksin 's relatives .
it ruled in favour of 21 television journalists who were sacked after the network they worked for was taken over by a company linked to the prime minister 's family .
they claimed they were illegally dismissed after complaining of political interference in their work , during mr thaksin 's first successful campaign to become prime minister .
the judge ordered that the 21 be rehired by the itv network , and receive four years ' back pay .
one of the defendants described the ruling as a breath of fresh air , at a time when the freedom of the press has been suppressed .

speedferries , which runs a single catamaran from dover to boulogne , said p & o offered cheap tickets only on sailings that coincide with its own .
as a result speedferries has slashed its prices to just over £ 7.50 one-way .
p & o ferries said it had to defend and protect its business because of new competition on the channel .
customers benefit chief executive of speedferries curt stavis said his company had been forced to make a complaint .
" we 've faced 100 different incidents where people have tried to disrupt our service , " he said .
mr stavis stressed he was not complaining about the price war as it was beneficial to customers , but he was angry at the way his biggest rival was going about it .
" we never targeted anybody , we just offer low prices .
" p & o offers are only available on the same departures as speedferries .
' expand business ' " it 's predatory pricing , " he said .
at present speedferries operate 10 crossings per day against p & o 's 40 .
mr stavis said he was keen to expand his business .
the cross-channel price war intensified last month when p & o announced it was to offer a return crossing for a car and passengers for £ 60 - more than £ 30 cheaper than rivals seafrance and eurotunnel .

the review calls for more specialist gps to work in community hospitals in rural areas , alongside nurse practitioners and ambulance crews .
