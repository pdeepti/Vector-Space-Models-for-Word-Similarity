a billion followers not included now you can have that feeling of being part of the flock everywhere you go thanks to a new portable benedict xvi pope doll which makes penance possible wherever you may be . while his boss is omnipotent , the pope himself can not be in two places at once and can therefore not be expected to be there for every one of the 1.1 billion catholics in the world in their hour of need . while pope benedict xvi 's beliefs prevent him from cloning himself , a german company has achieved the next best thing by creating a lifelike representation of the cardinal formerly known as joseph ratzinger which can be with the devoted wherever they may be - if they are among the lucky 999 to get the new pope doll while stocks last . bildunterschrift : it might have gray hair , but it surely does n't bear much of a resemblance to benedict xvi unfortunately , the new baby-faced pope doll hardly measures up to the bavarian pontiff in terms of size .
the 41-centimeter -lrb- 16-inch -rrb- doll would barely be tall enough to wave over the parapet of a balcony and would probably slip without trace down the back of the seat in the popemobile . even so , every one of the individually numbered collector 's edition dolls is likely to be snapped up . the doll , created by the schildkröt dollmaker firm with the assistance of the offermann dolls hospital , comes clad in white papal robes with a cross hanging round its neck , just in case anyone is confused as to whom it is supposed to represent . such signifiers will be welcomed as the face of the doll itself may throw some people as the 78-year-old pontiff 's effigy looks a good few decades younger even though its makers point out that it 's the first time one of their dolls comes with gray hair and gray eyebrows . " its arms and legs can be moved " and " its clothes are of a high quality and correspond exactly to the ' originals ' of the holy father , " the manufacturers said , which is comforting considering each doll costs 139 euros -lrb- $ 170 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pope teddy was the first toy to come to the market after benedict 's election .
if the child-like papal figurine is a little too unsettling , there is a cute pope teddy bear alternative for those looking for cuddly catholicism .
however , the plush pope will set the faithful back 160 euros . there are currently no plans to extend the doll range to include a line of alternative garments , vatican play-sets or spin-off collections featuring the great and good from the pope 's backroom staff . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw owner counts his blessings a 21-year-old who had the good luck of buying a volkswagen whose seats were once warmed by the current pope is suddenly flush with cash .
divine intervention ?
no : ebay .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

" its arms and legs can be moved " and " its clothes are of a high quality and correspond exactly to the ' originals ' of the holy father , " the manufacturers said , which is comforting considering each doll costs 139 euros -lrb- $ 170 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pope teddy was the first toy to come to the market after benedict 's election .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ . " i may be aggressive but i do not seek revenge " he said in a recent interview . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german not wanted in israel some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .

but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution may be in tatters but erdogan and gul 's hopes remain turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany . despite making steps to improve its human rights record and the treatment of women in its society , turkey now faces an increasingly uphill battle in its bid to become a member of the european union .
the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .
" there may be different views in the eu -lrb- on turkey 's candidacy -rrb- .
the important thing is the eu has decided to start negotiations on october 3 and has embarked on an irreversible path for turkey , " he told a business conference in televised remarks . " it 's not easy to say what kind of political environment there will be in europe in 10 years ' time but we do n't doubt the differences in eu perceptions of turkey will narrow , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .

" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

" we hope that we can persuade people to bring out their old coins , " a spokesman told reuters .
" coin telephones are still useful in this age of mobile phones . "
the bundesbank has estimated 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.58 billion -rrb- worth of mark notes and coins are still in private hands .
notes and coins can still be swapped for euros at bundesbank branches and german shops occasionally run promotions allowing shoppers to use the old currency .
but the telekom promotion will offer germans particular motivation to clean out their piggybanks .
software in pay phones has been reconfigured to allow them to accept 10 and 50 pfennig pieces , as well as one , two and five-mark coins , which were officially phased out after the introduction of euro coins and notes in 2002 .
but a one-to-one exchange rate means those using the old coins will get their calls at half price .
telekom 's decision comes at a time when a growing number of germans are blaming the euro for the country 's economic woes , making them nostalgic for the deutsche mark . dw-world.de government , bundesbank back euro the german government and the bundesbank pledged their support on wednesday for european monetary union and the euro .

a billion followers not included now you can have that feeling of being part of the flock everywhere you go thanks to a new portable benedict xvi pope doll which makes penance possible wherever you may be . while his boss is omnipotent , the pope himself can not be in two places at once and can therefore not be expected to be there for every one of the 1.1 billion catholics in the world in their hour of need . while pope benedict xvi 's beliefs prevent him from cloning himself , a german company has achieved the next best thing by creating a lifelike representation of the cardinal formerly known as joseph ratzinger which can be with the devoted wherever they may be - if they are among the lucky 999 to get the new pope doll while stocks last . bildunterschrift : it might have gray hair , but it surely does n't bear much of a resemblance to benedict xvi unfortunately , the new baby-faced pope doll hardly measures up to the bavarian pontiff in terms of size .
the 41-centimeter -lrb- 16-inch -rrb- doll would barely be tall enough to wave over the parapet of a balcony and would probably slip without trace down the back of the seat in the popemobile . even so , every one of the individually numbered collector 's edition dolls is likely to be snapped up . the doll , created by the schildkröt dollmaker firm with the assistance of the offermann dolls hospital , comes clad in white papal robes with a cross hanging round its neck , just in case anyone is confused as to whom it is supposed to represent . such signifiers will be welcomed as the face of the doll itself may throw some people as the 78-year-old pontiff 's effigy looks a good few decades younger even though its makers point out that it 's the first time one of their dolls comes with gray hair and gray eyebrows . " its arms and legs can be moved " and " its clothes are of a high quality and correspond exactly to the ' originals ' of the holy father , " the manufacturers said , which is comforting considering each doll costs 139 euros -lrb- $ 170 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pope teddy was the first toy to come to the market after benedict 's election .
if the child-like papal figurine is a little too unsettling , there is a cute pope teddy bear alternative for those looking for cuddly catholicism .
however , the plush pope will set the faithful back 160 euros . there are currently no plans to extend the doll range to include a line of alternative garments , vatican play-sets or spin-off collections featuring the great and good from the pope 's backroom staff . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw owner counts his blessings a 21-year-old who had the good luck of buying a volkswagen whose seats were once warmed by the current pope is suddenly flush with cash .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .

" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project wednesday , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .
the result plunges europe deeper into a serious institutional crisis .
-lrb- june 1 , 2005 -rrb- constitutional storm clouds over europe the people of france dealt a severe blow to europe on sunday when they voted against the eu constitution .
now attention is focused on the netherlands , where a referendum could seal the fate of the treaty .

still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution may be in tatters but erdogan and gul 's hopes remain turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany . despite making steps to improve its human rights record and the treatment of women in its society , turkey now faces an increasingly uphill battle in its bid to become a member of the european union .
the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .
" there may be different views in the eu -lrb- on turkey 's candidacy -rrb- .
the important thing is the eu has decided to start negotiations on october 3 and has embarked on an irreversible path for turkey , " he told a business conference in televised remarks . " it 's not easy to say what kind of political environment there will be in europe in 10 years ' time but we do n't doubt the differences in eu perceptions of turkey will narrow , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution may be in tatters but erdogan and gul 's hopes remain turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany . despite making steps to improve its human rights record and the treatment of women in its society , turkey now faces an increasingly uphill battle in its bid to become a member of the european union .
the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .
" there may be different views in the eu -lrb- on turkey 's candidacy -rrb- .
the important thing is the eu has decided to start negotiations on october 3 and has embarked on an irreversible path for turkey , " he told a business conference in televised remarks . " it 's not easy to say what kind of political environment there will be in europe in 10 years ' time but we do n't doubt the differences in eu perceptions of turkey will narrow , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .
the result plunges europe deeper into a serious institutional crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.06.2005 celebrating germany 's " literary pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he may have a lisp , but his tongue is still very sharp when he likes a book , he spares no words extolling its virtues .
but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .

but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .

but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .

" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press have been divided on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc 100k immigrants seen from enlarged eu more than 100,000 people from the newest eu members have emigrated to the older member states since the bloc was enlarged to 25 member states in 2004 , with most going to britain , a german economic institute said on wednesday .
the diw institute said that since may 1 , 2004 , when eight central and eastern european countries as well as cyprus and malta joined the european union , between 100,000 and 150,000 people had moved to the older member states .
the diw calculates that more than 50,000 people had entered britain .
that figure is far lower than statistics published last week in an official british study which found that more than 175,000 people had entered britain since the enlargement .
analyst herbert bruecker explained that the british figures and the diw statistics were calculated differently .
the 50,000 figure was an estimation of genuine new arrivals to britain , in other words , immigrants who had never visited or worked in britain before .
the diw said it was harder to enter austria , germany and italy than britain because of immigration restrictions .
in germany for example , there is a seven-year delay before citizens of the new eu members can obtain working permits .
diw analyst herbert bruecker recommended that germany relaxes its restriction because qualified workers were the first to emigrate and they headed for the countries with the most liberal immigration policy . dw-world.de easing workers ' mobility across the eu traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change .

the diw institute said that since may 1 , 2004 , when eight central and eastern european countries as well as cyprus and malta joined the european union , between 100,000 and 150,000 people had moved to the older member states .
the diw calculates that more than 50,000 people had entered britain .
that figure is far lower than statistics published last week in an official british study which found that more than 175,000 people had entered britain since the enlargement .
analyst herbert bruecker explained that the british figures and the diw statistics were calculated differently .
the 50,000 figure was an estimation of genuine new arrivals to britain , in other words , immigrants who had never visited or worked in britain before .
the diw said it was harder to enter austria , germany and italy than britain because of immigration restrictions .
in germany for example , there is a seven-year delay before citizens of the new eu members can obtain working permits .
diw analyst herbert bruecker recommended that germany relaxes its restriction because qualified workers were the first to emigrate and they headed for the countries with the most liberal immigration policy . dw-world.de easing workers ' mobility across the eu traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .

in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "

" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "

the diw institute said that since may 1 , 2004 , when eight central and eastern european countries as well as cyprus and malta joined the european union , between 100,000 and 150,000 people had moved to the older member states .
the diw calculates that more than 50,000 people had entered britain .
that figure is far lower than statistics published last week in an official british study which found that more than 175,000 people had entered britain since the enlargement .
analyst herbert bruecker explained that the british figures and the diw statistics were calculated differently .
the 50,000 figure was an estimation of genuine new arrivals to britain , in other words , immigrants who had never visited or worked in britain before .
the diw said it was harder to enter austria , germany and italy than britain because of immigration restrictions .
in germany for example , there is a seven-year delay before citizens of the new eu members can obtain working permits .
diw analyst herbert bruecker recommended that germany relaxes its restriction because qualified workers were the first to emigrate and they headed for the countries with the most liberal immigration policy . dw-world.de easing workers ' mobility across the eu traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution may be in tatters but erdogan and gul 's hopes remain turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany . despite making steps to improve its human rights record and the treatment of women in its society , turkey now faces an increasingly uphill battle in its bid to become a member of the european union .
the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 turkey resilient despite europe 's crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution may be in tatters but erdogan and gul 's hopes remain turkey 's hopes of eu accession remain high despite the rejection of the eu constitution by france and the netherlands and a potential swing to the right in ankara 's key supporter germany . despite making steps to improve its human rights record and the treatment of women in its society , turkey now faces an increasingly uphill battle in its bid to become a member of the european union .
the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .
" there may be different views in the eu -lrb- on turkey 's candidacy -rrb- .
the important thing is the eu has decided to start negotiations on october 3 and has embarked on an irreversible path for turkey , " he told a business conference in televised remarks . " it 's not easy to say what kind of political environment there will be in europe in 10 years ' time but we do n't doubt the differences in eu perceptions of turkey will narrow , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .

"

an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .

he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .

" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "
billions available to research groups though there are dozens of eu organizations that offer considerable research funding , the european commission 's framework program is the union 's largest research funding pot .
the program 's 17.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.5 billion -rrb- for 2001 to 2006 can be awarded to universities , research centers , businesses or even individuals .
details for the 2007 to 2013 , which could total over 67 billion euros , are still being discussed as part of the union 's long-term budget .
with so much money to be handed out , it 's no surprise that many companies around the union are more than willing to help researchers find their pot of gold .

knowing where to find the more complicated appropriate funding is one of the questions researchers face , according to mireille van der graaf , welcome europe 's editorial manager .
" it is difficult to know where , when and what kind of funding is available for certain projects , " she said .
" we identified more than 400 programs , some of which are very similar , so it 's not always easy to know which is the most appropriate . "
international cooperation required while requirements vary from project to project , the commission does lay down certain prerequisites before opening its purse strings .
the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .
while mochan stressed that national quotas are anathema to determining who receives funding , the current budget does take into account activities that would increase the role of women in research and stresses the importance of research in genomics and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to increase the number of women in research fields biotechnology for health ; information society technologies ; nanotechnologies and nanosciences ; aeronautics and space ; food safety ; sustainable development ; and economic and social sciences .
" the categories for the next framework program have also been kept broad because we do not want to rule out any excellent research , " said mochan .
" we have to focus on commission priorities but do not want to handcuff ourselves to today 's priorities for 2013 . "
public-private partnership even if there are n't any hard rules as to what the eu is ready to support , van der graaf said she has an idea of what the union " tends to encourage . "
" the european commission likes public-private partnerships , " she added .
" also , since the enlargement it is well-seen to integrate new member states in projects . "
the next five years may bring an increase in the security research , according to van der graaf .
" last year there was a new program for security issues , " she said .
" that could be a main research area for the future .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .
the german government was less than happy that germany 's largest bank could be absorbed by a rival from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank may be a more palatable partner for fellow german bank hvb hvb is a smaller bank with less political clout and it is unlikely that the government would be forced to intervene in a takeover by unicredito .
however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .

however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "

he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .

" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "

the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 paying for european research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nanotechnology will be a eu research priority from 2006 to 2013 the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping , but how do scientists get their hands on the money ? fred stroh , of the jülich research center in western germany , knows how complicated it can be to receive funding from the european union .
he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .
" it can be a long process of determining goals and evaluation methods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say receiving funding it too bureaucratic , a situation the eu hopes to change eu officials admit the process can often be a drawn-out affair , especially for researchers who typically are not used to dealing with finances and paperwork , that 's partially their intention .
" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "
billions available to research groups though there are dozens of eu organizations that offer considerable research funding , the european commission 's framework program is the union 's largest research funding pot .
the program 's 17.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.5 billion -rrb- for 2001 to 2006 can be awarded to universities , research centers , businesses or even individuals .
details for the 2007 to 2013 , which could total over 67 billion euros , are still being discussed as part of the union 's long-term budget .
with so much money to be handed out , it 's no surprise that many companies around the union are more than willing to help researchers find their pot of gold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing where and when to apply for funding can be complicated welcome europe , a paris-based company , consults and trains groups searching for eu grants .
knowing where to find the more complicated appropriate funding is one of the questions researchers face , according to mireille van der graaf , welcome europe 's editorial manager .
" it is difficult to know where , when and what kind of funding is available for certain projects , " she said .
" we identified more than 400 programs , some of which are very similar , so it 's not always easy to know which is the most appropriate . "
international cooperation required while requirements vary from project to project , the commission does lay down certain prerequisites before opening its purse strings .
the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .
while mochan stressed that national quotas are anathema to determining who receives funding , the current budget does take into account activities that would increase the role of women in research and stresses the importance of research in genomics and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to increase the number of women in research fields biotechnology for health ; information society technologies ; nanotechnologies and nanosciences ; aeronautics and space ; food safety ; sustainable development ; and economic and social sciences .
" the categories for the next framework program have also been kept broad because we do not want to rule out any excellent research , " said mochan .
" we have to focus on commission priorities but do not want to handcuff ourselves to today 's priorities for 2013 . "
public-private partnership even if there are n't any hard rules as to what the eu is ready to support , van der graaf said she has an idea of what the union " tends to encourage . "
" the european commission likes public-private partnerships , " she added .
" also , since the enlargement it is well-seen to integrate new member states in projects . "
the next five years may bring an increase in the security research , according to van der graaf .
" last year there was a new program for security issues , " she said .
" that could be a main research area for the future .

he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .
" it can be a long process of determining goals and evaluation methods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say receiving funding it too bureaucratic , a situation the eu hopes to change eu officials admit the process can often be a drawn-out affair , especially for researchers who typically are not used to dealing with finances and paperwork , that 's partially their intention .
" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "
billions available to research groups though there are dozens of eu organizations that offer considerable research funding , the european commission 's framework program is the union 's largest research funding pot .
the program 's 17.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.5 billion -rrb- for 2001 to 2006 can be awarded to universities , research centers , businesses or even individuals .
details for the 2007 to 2013 , which could total over 67 billion euros , are still being discussed as part of the union 's long-term budget .
with so much money to be handed out , it 's no surprise that many companies around the union are more than willing to help researchers find their pot of gold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing where and when to apply for funding can be complicated welcome europe , a paris-based company , consults and trains groups searching for eu grants .
knowing where to find the more complicated appropriate funding is one of the questions researchers face , according to mireille van der graaf , welcome europe 's editorial manager .
" it is difficult to know where , when and what kind of funding is available for certain projects , " she said .
" we identified more than 400 programs , some of which are very similar , so it 's not always easy to know which is the most appropriate . "
international cooperation required while requirements vary from project to project , the commission does lay down certain prerequisites before opening its purse strings .
the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .
while mochan stressed that national quotas are anathema to determining who receives funding , the current budget does take into account activities that would increase the role of women in research and stresses the importance of research in genomics and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to increase the number of women in research fields biotechnology for health ; information society technologies ; nanotechnologies and nanosciences ; aeronautics and space ; food safety ; sustainable development ; and economic and social sciences .
" the categories for the next framework program have also been kept broad because we do not want to rule out any excellent research , " said mochan .
" we have to focus on commission priorities but do not want to handcuff ourselves to today 's priorities for 2013 . "
public-private partnership even if there are n't any hard rules as to what the eu is ready to support , van der graaf said she has an idea of what the union " tends to encourage . "
" the european commission likes public-private partnerships , " she added .
" also , since the enlargement it is well-seen to integrate new member states in projects . "
the next five years may bring an increase in the security research , according to van der graaf .
" last year there was a new program for security issues , " she said .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project wednesday , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .

observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .

" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press have been divided on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .

" the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press have been divided on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .

there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .

he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "

which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "

" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .

however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

a billion followers not included now you can have that feeling of being part of the flock everywhere you go thanks to a new portable benedict xvi pope doll which makes penance possible wherever you may be . while his boss is omnipotent , the pope himself can not be in two places at once and can therefore not be expected to be there for every one of the 1.1 billion catholics in the world in their hour of need . while pope benedict xvi 's beliefs prevent him from cloning himself , a german company has achieved the next best thing by creating a lifelike representation of the cardinal formerly known as joseph ratzinger which can be with the devoted wherever they may be - if they are among the lucky 999 to get the new pope doll while stocks last . bildunterschrift : it might have gray hair , but it surely does n't bear much of a resemblance to benedict xvi unfortunately , the new baby-faced pope doll hardly measures up to the bavarian pontiff in terms of size .
the 41-centimeter -lrb- 16-inch -rrb- doll would barely be tall enough to wave over the parapet of a balcony and would probably slip without trace down the back of the seat in the popemobile . even so , every one of the individually numbered collector 's edition dolls is likely to be snapped up . the doll , created by the schildkröt dollmaker firm with the assistance of the offermann dolls hospital , comes clad in white papal robes with a cross hanging round its neck , just in case anyone is confused as to whom it is supposed to represent . such signifiers will be welcomed as the face of the doll itself may throw some people as the 78-year-old pontiff 's effigy looks a good few decades younger even though its makers point out that it 's the first time one of their dolls comes with gray hair and gray eyebrows . " its arms and legs can be moved " and " its clothes are of a high quality and correspond exactly to the ' originals ' of the holy father , " the manufacturers said , which is comforting considering each doll costs 139 euros -lrb- $ 170 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pope teddy was the first toy to come to the market after benedict 's election .
if the child-like papal figurine is a little too unsettling , there is a cute pope teddy bear alternative for those looking for cuddly catholicism .
however , the plush pope will set the faithful back 160 euros . there are currently no plans to extend the doll range to include a line of alternative garments , vatican play-sets or spin-off collections featuring the great and good from the pope 's backroom staff . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw owner counts his blessings a 21-year-old who had the good luck of buying a volkswagen whose seats were once warmed by the current pope is suddenly flush with cash .

" we hope that we can persuade people to bring out their old coins , " a spokesman told reuters .
" coin telephones are still useful in this age of mobile phones . "
the bundesbank has estimated 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.58 billion -rrb- worth of mark notes and coins are still in private hands .
notes and coins can still be swapped for euros at bundesbank branches and german shops occasionally run promotions allowing shoppers to use the old currency .
but the telekom promotion will offer germans particular motivation to clean out their piggybanks .
software in pay phones has been reconfigured to allow them to accept 10 and 50 pfennig pieces , as well as one , two and five-mark coins , which were officially phased out after the introduction of euro coins and notes in 2002 .
but a one-to-one exchange rate means those using the old coins will get their calls at half price .
telekom 's decision comes at a time when a growing number of germans are blaming the euro for the country 's economic woes , making them nostalgic for the deutsche mark . dw-world.de government , bundesbank back euro the german government and the bundesbank pledged their support on wednesday for european monetary union and the euro .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .
the result plunges europe deeper into a serious institutional crisis .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .

by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .

he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .

" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "

the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .

it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ . " i may be aggressive but i do not seek revenge " he said in a recent interview . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german not wanted in israel some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors .

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .
" there may be different views in the eu -lrb- on turkey 's candidacy -rrb- .
the important thing is the eu has decided to start negotiations on october 3 and has embarked on an irreversible path for turkey , " he told a business conference in televised remarks . " it 's not easy to say what kind of political environment there will be in europe in 10 years ' time but we do n't doubt the differences in eu perceptions of turkey will narrow , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's euro-skeptic ranks swell turks are increasingly critical of the country 's possible accession to the eu as euro-skeptics warn of a potential sell-out of national interests .

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .
the german government was less than happy that germany 's largest bank could be absorbed by a rival from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank may be a more palatable partner for fellow german bank hvb hvb is a smaller bank with less political clout and it is unlikely that the government would be forced to intervene in a takeover by unicredito .
however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 paying for european research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nanotechnology will be a eu research priority from 2006 to 2013 the eu has over 400 funding programs , many of which are dedicated to particular fields of research ranging from nuclear science to bee keeping , but how do scientists get their hands on the money ? fred stroh , of the jülich research center in western germany , knows how complicated it can be to receive funding from the european union .
he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .
" it can be a long process of determining goals and evaluation methods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say receiving funding it too bureaucratic , a situation the eu hopes to change eu officials admit the process can often be a drawn-out affair , especially for researchers who typically are not used to dealing with finances and paperwork , that 's partially their intention .
" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "
billions available to research groups though there are dozens of eu organizations that offer considerable research funding , the european commission 's framework program is the union 's largest research funding pot .
the program 's 17.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.5 billion -rrb- for 2001 to 2006 can be awarded to universities , research centers , businesses or even individuals .
details for the 2007 to 2013 , which could total over 67 billion euros , are still being discussed as part of the union 's long-term budget .
with so much money to be handed out , it 's no surprise that many companies around the union are more than willing to help researchers find their pot of gold .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing where and when to apply for funding can be complicated welcome europe , a paris-based company , consults and trains groups searching for eu grants .
knowing where to find the more complicated appropriate funding is one of the questions researchers face , according to mireille van der graaf , welcome europe 's editorial manager .
" it is difficult to know where , when and what kind of funding is available for certain projects , " she said .
" we identified more than 400 programs , some of which are very similar , so it 's not always easy to know which is the most appropriate . "
international cooperation required while requirements vary from project to project , the commission does lay down certain prerequisites before opening its purse strings .
the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .
while mochan stressed that national quotas are anathema to determining who receives funding , the current budget does take into account activities that would increase the role of women in research and stresses the importance of research in genomics and bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to increase the number of women in research fields biotechnology for health ; information society technologies ; nanotechnologies and nanosciences ; aeronautics and space ; food safety ; sustainable development ; and economic and social sciences .
" the categories for the next framework program have also been kept broad because we do not want to rule out any excellent research , " said mochan .
" we have to focus on commission priorities but do not want to handcuff ourselves to today 's priorities for 2013 . "
public-private partnership even if there are n't any hard rules as to what the eu is ready to support , van der graaf said she has an idea of what the union " tends to encourage . "
" the european commission likes public-private partnerships , " she added .
" also , since the enlargement it is well-seen to integrate new member states in projects . "
the next five years may bring an increase in the security research , according to van der graaf .
" last year there was a new program for security issues , " she said .
" that could be a main research area for the future .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .

it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .

germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .
" we expect to continue our ratification process , " lars danielsson , prime minister persson 's chief advisor , told afp after early dutch results were in . but he acknowledged that pressure for a referendum , rather than a simple parliamentary ratification , will grow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ .

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .
our fundamental objective in the coming days is to ensure the successful completion of membership negotiations with the european union which will start on october 3 , " it added . when the heads of the eu states agreed to open accession negotiations with turkey in december and penciled in the october 3 start date on condition of progress in the cyprus situation , few would have predicted the bloc to be in such turmoil as it got closer to the time of the talks . turkey cited as reason for rejection but for turkey , the state of the bloc it so desperately wants to join matters little .
there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .
a conservative administration which has publicly opposed turkey 's entry to the eu in favor of a diluted " privileged partnership " version which would have no voting rights . the " privileged partnership " was originally spoken of by the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- leader edmund stoiber in december but it has been adopted by the recently nominated christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel one week ago , the cdu leader reiterated the opposition 's stance on turkey , saying that turkey should only be allowed to take part in accession talks if it has recognized cyprus as a state under international law and has renewed diplomatic relations with armenia by october . while abdullah gül indirectly rejected merkel 's calls , turkish economy minister ali babacan took a more pragmatic approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "

" we hope that we can persuade people to bring out their old coins , " a spokesman told reuters .
" coin telephones are still useful in this age of mobile phones . "
the bundesbank has estimated 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.58 billion -rrb- worth of mark notes and coins are still in private hands .
notes and coins can still be swapped for euros at bundesbank branches and german shops occasionally run promotions allowing shoppers to use the old currency .
but the telekom promotion will offer germans particular motivation to clean out their piggybanks .
software in pay phones has been reconfigured to allow them to accept 10 and 50 pfennig pieces , as well as one , two and five-mark coins , which were officially phased out after the introduction of euro coins and notes in 2002 .
but a one-to-one exchange rate means those using the old coins will get their calls at half price .
telekom 's decision comes at a time when a growing number of germans are blaming the euro for the country 's economic woes , making them nostalgic for the deutsche mark . dw-world.de government , bundesbank back euro the german government and the bundesbank pledged their support on wednesday for european monetary union and the euro .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .

however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

the fact that this situation arises through no fault of its own has only made turkey more resilient in its accession campaign . the double ' no ' vote from france and the netherlands on the european constitution may have left the treaty in tatters but turkey remains committed to becoming a member of this dysfunctional family . " we keep our hopes alive that the problems that have emerged will also be overcome and european integration will be taken forward to new targets as the necessary lessons are learned from the democratic decisions of the french and dutch people , " a statement from the turkish government released on thursday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey will keep up efforts to accomplish the choice that the overwhelming part of its people has made .

there is no mention of turkey 's entry in the constitutional text and there is no law which states that new members can not be admitted until there is a valid constitution in place . however , as turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül admitted recently , while it does not directly affect the process surrounding an accession bid , the dutch and french rejection of the treaty does change the political climate ; a change which could prove costly to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the constitution text did not mention turkey , the idea of the islamic country joining the eu was definitely a referendum issue , as much as part of the whole enlargement discussion as one regarding the specifics of 70 million turks joining the eu . in france , where many right-wing groups brought up the turkey question as part of the ' non ' campaign , president jacques chirac 's position has been severely weakened .
before the referendum , chirac was a staunch supporter of turkey 's bid .
now , he may have to pacify an empowered populace by toning down his support . conservative germany could cripple bid germany , another of turkey 's main supporters , may have not had to go through the potentially painful process of a referendum to ratify the constitution but still faces internal upheaval which may dilute or even dissolve its patronage of turkey 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens being ousted from government in early federal elections this year may lead to a conservative administration taking the reins .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .
he never apologized for his behavior , quite the contrary .
why should i want to wish him a happy birthday ? " reich-ranicki would beg to differ .

marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .

germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution . french president jacques chirac will hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder in the german capital on saturday about the deeping institutional crisis surrounding the eu , it was announced on thursday .
the two leaders will take stock of the situation at a working dinner which comes after dutch voters decided against the eu constitution on wednesday , dealing the treaty a second blow after france had rejected it at the weekend .
" the french president will go to berlin on saturday , june 4 , for a face-to-face working dinner with the chancellor , following the referendums in france and the netherlands , " the french president 's spokesman jerome bonnafont said in paris . " this working dinner will focus on assessing the current situation and reflecting on the future of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder said yes .
france said no .
chirac and schröder are two of the strongest advocates of the eu constitution , and the chancellor put aside his domestic woes to visit france and urge voters to back the constitution ahead of last sunday 's referendum .
schröder in luxembourg in a flurry of meetings following the resounding dutch rejection , schröder traveled to luxembourg on thursday to hold crisis talks with the current eu president jean-claude juncker .
despite the refusal from the two founder members of the european union , schröder called for the ratification process to continue in the remaining countries of the 25-member bloc .
germany ratified the constitution last week although the process was done only by its two houses of parliament and was not put to a referendum . ten countries have now ratified the treaty , two have rejected it , and 13 still have to undergo the process .
the parliament of latvia , one of the ten states which joined the bloc in last year 's enlargement , voted in favor of ratifying the constitution on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime-minister jan peter balkenende reacts at the result of the dutch referendum on the european union 's first constitution as 63 percent voted against .
as news of chirac and schröder 's meeting was announced dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende called on european union leaders to think less about increasing the eu 's range and power and more about making the bloc more accessible to its citizens .
after the crushing blow dealt to the treaty by dutch voters in wednesday 's referendum balkenende told dutch lawmakers that the message his government would take to brussels was " not always more and always further but how can we bring europe closer to the people " . warning from swedish pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson meanwhile , swedish prime minister göran persson said on thursday it would be " dangerous " and " stupid " for other eu members to ignore the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters .
" the most dangerous thing now , the most stupid and in my opinion , the least sensible political thing , would be to send a signal that we are not influenced by this .
it is clear that we are , " persson told the swedish news agency tt .
persson said there was a " current of thinking among european leaders " that the results of the referendums should be ignored , but this was misguided .
he hoped that an eu summit meeting in brussels on june 16 and 17 would result in a " fruitful discussion on how to continue , " the prime minister said .
if france or the netherlands , based on the outcome of their respective votes , asked for a renegotiation of the treaty the process of ratification would be " completely interrupted " , he said .
sweden 's parliament is to vote on the treaty before the end of the year , and the government reiterated late on wednesday that no changes are planned .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .

"
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .

schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .
the german government was less than happy that germany 's largest bank could be absorbed by a rival from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank may be a more palatable partner for fellow german bank hvb hvb is a smaller bank with less political clout and it is unlikely that the government would be forced to intervene in a takeover by unicredito .
however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de did hitler have the bomb ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2005 eu in agony after constitution fiasco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker : " europe no longer makes people dream " europe agonized over the eu constitution 's future thursday after dutch voters rejected it wednesday .
while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dutch farmer covers his cows with blankets that read " eu constitution - mooh ! "
" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "
the eu summit in brussels on june 16 and 17 has now assumed crucial importance in determining the road ahead for the beleaguered bloc .
following wednesday 's " no " vote , it has been dubbed " the crisis summit . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch reject eu constitution dutch voters fired a second shot to the heart of the european project , rejecting the eu constitution only days after france did .
the result plunges europe deeper into a serious institutional crisis .

while some fear that the " no " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue . the european union 's luxembourg presidency and eu heavyweights france and germany said the process of ratifying the charter should continue in other member states . dutch voters on wednesday followed their french counterparts in rejecting the draft constitution .
many european leaders insisted the treaty was still alive and worth preserving .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he respected , but regretted the outcome of the dutch referendum .
" i am convinced that we need the constitution if we want a democratic , social-minded and strong europe , " schröder said in a statement .
schröder said the ratification process must continue .
" the crisis about the ratification of the european constitution can not become a general crisis about europe , " he said .
there was no sound alternative , he added .
europe will continue moving forward french president jacques chirac said the dutch vote , like the french , had highlighted " strong expectations , questions and concerns over the development of the european project , " according to a statement by his office .
the eu 's luxembourg presidency said the process of ratifying the treaty in other european nations should be allowed to continue despite the setbacks .

" i remain of the view that the ratification process must be able to continue in other states , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
he vowed to bring proposals to the upcoming eu summit in brussels in mid-june that would help the bloc recover its poise .
" it is not the first blow to europe , " juncker said .
" there have been others , since the 1950s until late in the 1970s , and each time europe got over them , got up again and continued along its road . "
but he acknowledged the impact of the crushing dutch vote , saying it showed that " europe no longer makes people dream . "
which direction will europe take ?
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency next month , said the two referendums raised " profound questions for all of us about the future direction of europe . "
prime minister tony blair has promised to hold a referendum in notoriously euroskeptic britain next year , which opinion polls suggest would result in another defeat for the text .
but the london media has been full of reports that the french and dutch results may give him an excuse to call it off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european constitution was signed in rome last october italian deputy prime minister giulio tremonti went even further .
" i think that the european constitution as it has been presented and managed is finished , " tremonti said .
" after a popular vote such as that which took place in france and the netherlands , i think that the process on the text is finished , " tremonti said .
" i see no alternative , technically or politically . "
but analysts warn that if the ratification process were to be halted , the bloc could sink into an extended period of introspection with repeat referendums .
in any case , negotiations are unlikely to change the bigger picture , said klaus-peter sick , a political analyst at the marc bloch research center in berlin .
" the process of ratification is a long one and there is quite a bit of time left , " sick said .
" i do n't think renegotiations will bring different results . "
taking the people seriously danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said his country would go ahead with its referendum on sept .
27 and other nations should proceed likewise .
but he conceded that the dutch blow " must be taken seriously . "
germany 's schröder shared his opinion .
" we have to note that many europeans have doubts whether europe is in the position to supply answers to the pushing questions of the time , " schröder said .
" we have to take the worries and difficulties of the people seriously . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins through august .
" we hope that we can persuade people to bring out their old coins , " a spokesman told reuters .
" coin telephones are still useful in this age of mobile phones . "
the bundesbank has estimated 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.58 billion -rrb- worth of mark notes and coins are still in private hands .
notes and coins can still be swapped for euros at bundesbank branches and german shops occasionally run promotions allowing shoppers to use the old currency .
but the telekom promotion will offer germans particular motivation to clean out their piggybanks .
software in pay phones has been reconfigured to allow them to accept 10 and 50 pfennig pieces , as well as one , two and five-mark coins , which were officially phased out after the introduction of euro coins and notes in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2005 government ends visa investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-greens coalition pulled the plug as germany prepares for early elections , the coalition government has initiated steps to dissolve a parliamentary committee looking into large-scale visa abuses .
the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .
in a high-profile televised hearing of fischer in april , the committee grilled the foreign minister for fourteen hours .
opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats now claim the red-green government wants to avoid more bad publicity and would aim to duck allegations that fischer might have lied in the committee .
they hope that otto schily 's testimony , originally scheduled for july 8 , would unveil more unpleasant facts about the visa scandal .
these could then be used by the conservatives in their bid to oust chancellor gerhard schröder in the upcoming election .
foreign minister fischer has already fallen from popular grace for his role in the affair and can no longer claim to be germany 's most popular politician . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

the move has outraged the conservative opposition . thursday 's testimonies of the german ambassador to the philippines and several border police officials were most likely to be the last to be heard by the inquiry committee investigating the german visa scandal .
representatives of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their coalition partners from the greens used their majority in the committee in berlin on thursday to stop hearings of witnesses and agreed to start working on a final report .
less than four months ahead of early elections in germany , the panel was bound by law to make the controversial move , said the greens committee representative jerzey montag .
he said they had to take into account that there will be general elections in september .
" this means the committee can not complete its work in this legislative period , " said montag .
" under these circumstances , we are forced by law to start working on a preliminary report in time for parliament to adopt it .
consequently , we have to stop the hearings now and get going with the report . "
heading to constitutional court the committee representative from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , eckehardt von klaeden , questioned the legality of any moves to stop the investigation .
" we all want early elections , but at the moment , not a single precondition for those elections , as laid down in the constitution , has been fulfilled , " said von klaeden .
" that is why there is no reason at all to stop the work of the inquiry committee by taking such an arbitrary decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's testimony before the parliamentary panel attracted much media attention on thursday , the opposition parties vowed to lodge a complaint with germany ’ s constitutional court and press for the committee to be allowed to proceed with the hearings .
montag said the motives for the opposition were election-driven .
" the opposition refuses to take the necessary decisions and only wants to arm themselves for the upcoming election campaign , " he said .
" in doing this , they are abusing the parliamentary committee for party-political goals . "
schily silenced as a result of the imminent dissolution of the committee , a high-profile hearing of interior minister otto schily will fall by the wayside .
observers believe that the greens had pushed the decision in order to prevent a much-publicized dispute between schily and the greens ' figurehead , foreign minister joschka fischer .
schily is said to have been hugely critical of the lax visa policy introduced by fischer in early 2000 .
the foreign minister 's loosening of entry rules at german consulates allegedly led to the influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers , prostitutes and even two suspected terrorists between 2000 and 2002 .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .
the german government was less than happy that germany 's largest bank could be absorbed by a rival from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank may be a more palatable partner for fellow german bank hvb hvb is a smaller bank with less political clout and it is unlikely that the government would be forced to intervene in a takeover by unicredito .
however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .
the swiss ubs , london 's hsbc holdings and credit agricole of france are europe ’ s biggest banks by assets . the merger would also give unicredito control of bank austria creditanstalt , which has 10 million clients in eastern europe .
" the main attraction would be the creation of a clear number one in central and eastern europe , almost double the size of the next-largest western bank , " london-based merrill lynch analyst stuart graham told reporters last week .
german skepticism the issue of national control has often been raised whenever a bank merger has been touted in germany .
political resistance in berlin scuppered a potential sale of deutsche bank last year to american rival citigroup .
the german government was less than happy that germany 's largest bank could be absorbed by a rival from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank may be a more palatable partner for fellow german bank hvb hvb is a smaller bank with less political clout and it is unlikely that the government would be forced to intervene in a takeover by unicredito .
however , hvb has long been some by some in the banking industry as a potential merger partner for commerzbank , another large german private bank , and those rumors could be revived by unicredito 's interest leading to a rival bid or exertion of national pressure from the capital . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hvb records huge losses , plans job cuts hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , germany 's second-biggest bank , has announced plans to cut 2,200-2,400 jobs in its domestic operations as it remained entrenched in loss last year .

he spent months dealing with eu eligibility formalities , contracts and funding schemes , organizing 15 research partners and putting together the scientific proposal and goal description when he assembled an international team to study arctic ozone depletion .
" you put together a consortium and assign certain duties to certain scientists , " said stroh , describing how he organized the project that received two million euros -lrb- $ 2.45 million -rrb- of eu support and ran from 2001 to 2004 .

" we have heard from many researchers that the application process is too bureaucratic and too burdensome , " said antonia mochan , the european commission spokesperson for science and research .
" we have tried to address those difficulties in the next proposed framework , but a certain degree of control is necessary when you 're dealing with such large sums of taxpayer money . "

the research groups generally need to be made up of at least three different institutions from three different eu member states and must show their work will be beneficial to the union as a whole before they can take their check to the bank .

unicredito seems ready to bid for hvb germany 's hypovereinsbank and italy 's unicredito are nearing agreement on a possible merger which is expected to be finalized sometime in june , according to reports . the possible banking merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank group ag -lrb- hvb -rrb- and unicredito italiano spa is still shrouded in speculation , but on wednesday events conspired to shed light on the progress of a deal which could create a bank with about 733 billion euros -lrb- $ 897 billion -rrb- in assets . according to a report in germany 's börsen zeitung , hvb , formed from the merger of hypo-bank and bayerische vereinsbank seven years ago , and unicredito are expected to reach an agreement later in june , some months earlier than indicated by unicredito 's deputy chairman fabrizio palenzona on tuesday when he estimated the deal to be finalized by september or october . the report stated that hvb 's chief executive dieter rampl and chief financial officer wolfgang sprissler have informed the supervisory board of the talks with unicredito while the italians were also preparing to take over hvb in an estimated 16 billion euro share swap . board may block merger however , the merger may face opposition both from the head of the hvb supervisory board , albrecht schmidt , and germany 's works council according to the financial times deutschland , citing sources within the financial industry .
schmidt , a former ceo of the bank , has recently reiterated his long-standing belief that hvb would not be sold off as a junior partner in an unequal merger .
but since unicredito 's market capitalization is almost double that of the german bank , the talks bare less centered on a merger but more on a takeover of hvb by the italians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hvb supervisory board and the works council may give a red light to the merger and stop it in its tracks while formal opposition to the deal is unlikely to materialize until the details are announced , peter könig , the head of the works council , called for the continued independence of the bank to prevent job losses , firmly stating : " we can make it on our own . "
despite the belligerent tone , könig admitted that an international merger would have less grave consequences than a domestic one .
an inner-german merger could result in as many as 10,000 job cuts .
europe 's biggest banking takeover ? if the deal is agreed at 16 billion euros - the value of hvb after two days of speculation over the merger boosted its shares by 5.2 per cent - it would be the biggest cross-border banking takeover in europe , exceeding the 12.4 billion euros that santander central hispano , the largest bank in spain and latin america , paid last year for britain ’ s abbey national . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union bank of switzerland is one of the top banks by asset in europe the new bank 's combined assets would see it leapfrog the credit suisse group to take the number eight slot in the league table of european banks by assets .

archival materials provide new evidence for the history of the nazi nuclear program and raise questions about the chances it had for success . a pair of german and us historians said wednesday they had found the only known diagram for the nuclear bomb that nazi scientists strived to build during world war ii . the rough schematic does not imply that the nazis built or even were close to building a nuclear bomb , but it shows they had progressed farther toward that goal than is conventionally thought , they said in an article in the june issue of the british monthly physics world . the 60-year-old document is part of a report that appears to have been produced just after the end of the war in europe in may 1945 and describes the work on nuclear weapons that had been carried out during the conflict . the report is undated and in addition lacks a title page , which means its author or authors can not be identified .
it came from a " private archive , " the historians said . in addition to the rough plan for a bomb , the nazi report estimates , relatively accurately , that a plutonium warhead of just over five kilos -lrb- 11 pounds -rrb- was needed to achieve critical mass - the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear blast . bildunterschrift : the schematic of a nuclear bomb believed to have been in development by the nazis the historians are rainer karlsch , an independent historian based in berlin , and mark walker of union college , schenectady , new york state . did the nazis conduct bomb tests ? karlsch stirred controversy earlier this year when he published a book in germany , " hitlers bombe , " -lrb- hitler 's bomb -rrb- in which he claimed that the nazis had successfully tested a primitive nuclear device in the last days of world war ii as allied troops were closing in on both sides . the device , tested in thuringia , eastern germany , killed several hundred prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , the book said . that assertion was scoffed at by other historians , who said that by the end of the war , the nazis still did not fully understand the process of chain reaction and the way in which fast neutrons emitted by plutonium or uranium-235 atoms trigger further fission reactions .
this ignorance in turn caused the nazi scientists to grossly over-estimate the amount of nuclear material needed to achieve critical mass , according to the critics ' view . karlsch and walker rebut this , saying that new sources of historical material , such as documents squirreled away in russian archives , are showing that the nazis were farther down the road to acquiring nuclear capability than was thought previously . a tiny program germany 's " uranium project " was launched in 1939 to investigate nuclear reactors , isotope separation and nuclear explosives .
unlike the us-led manhattan project , which harnessed thousands of people and several billion dollars to devise the bombs that were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 , the german effort amounted to no more than a few dozen scattered scientists . scientific files seized after the war , and bugged conversations of 10 german nuclear scientists held in a british prison camp in 1945 , forged the conventional belief , prevailing today , that even though hitler craved a nuclear bomb , he was still months or more likely years from ever getting one . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : did hitler have the bomb ?

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .
his father was a polish jew , his mother the daughter of a german rabbi .
the family moved to berlin in 1929 after the father 's firm went bankrupt . reich-ranicki passed his final school exams in october 1938 , shortly before the kristallnacht -lrb- the night of broken glass -rrb- , in which the nazis deported 17,000 jews of polish origin , reich-ranicki included , across the polish border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of jews , including a small boy , is escorted from the warsaw ghetto by german soldiers in this 1943 photo during the war , reich-ranicki lived for three years in the warsaw ghetto and later became a volunteer in the polish army .
by the end of the war , he was a member of the polish communist party and also started working for the polish secret service -lrb- mbp -rrb- as a diplomat in london . in his autobiography , reich-ranicki claimed that his work was harmless , that he had neither put anyone in danger nor taken advantage of anyone . but in 2002 , the german weekly die zeit published excerpts from his mbp files which made it seem that his role in the secret service was more significant than he cared to admit . a passion for literature rekindled reich-ranicki 's political career ended abruptly after he was expelled from the communist party .
he devoted his time to his old passion , literature , at first in poland , and from 1958 on in germany . from 1960 until 1973 , reich-ranicki was the literary critic for the german weekly die zeit .
in 1973 , he took charge of the literary section at frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in the next two decades , he became " germany 's most read , most feared , most observed , and therefore most hated literary critic " as one of his colleagues described him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki with his collegues from the " literarisches quartett , " iris radisch and hellmuth karasek his popularity reached its culmination with the television show " das literarische quartett " -lrb- the literary quartet -rrb- which brought his eloquence , erudition and wit to the widest german audience . between 1998 and 2001 , reich-ranicki appeared in 77 shows and discussed over 400 books on this highly rated show . a bad-tempered media star numerous talents , such as the poet ulla hahn , were either discovered or promoted by reich-ranicki over the years in which he has reigned as the supreme authority on german literary affairs .
but many an established writer , too , has experienced the wrath of a peevish critic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature nobel prize winner german writer günter grass in 1995 , reich-ranicki published his devastating account of günter grass ' novel das weite feld -lrb- the wide field -rrb- describing the writing of the future nobel prize winner as " illegible " and his novel as " worthless prose from the beginning to the end . " the public controversy over the role of the critic and the absolutist manner in which reich-ranicki is known to pronounce his judgments was further stirred up by the publication of martin walser 's novel tod eines kritkers -lrb- the death of a critic -rrb- in 2002 , a vaguely disguised pamphlet against the towering figure of german literary criticism which ends with his death . " i am no judge , i am more of a public prosecutor or a defense lawyer , " reich-ranicki said .
" the attorney for the authors that i am anxious to defend , and occasionally the prosecutor , but - i must put it pompously - on behalf of literature . " a critic 's critics there is no doubt that reich-ranicki has left a permanent mark in the history of german literary criticism .
german president köhler said reich-ranicki " personified in his way german national culture . " but not everybody was in a celebratory mood on thursday .
sigrid löffler , his colleague and former co-host of the literary quartett , was not interested in lionizing the birthday boy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " five years ago , marcel reich-ranicki publicly tried to tarnish my reputation , " she told reporters .
" without provocation and , i believe , out of malice .

but when he does n't , all hell breaks loose .
marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's grumpiest literary critic , turned 85 on thursday . in the same year in which germany celebrates the 200th anniversary of the death of friedrich schiller , another important cultural event is taking place : the 85th birthday of marcel reich-ranicki , a critic and undisputed star of the german literary scene , whose passion for books and belief in the indispensability of fiction is only matched by his sharp tongue , acerbic wit and ruthless critical style . reich-ranicki , who is sometimes half-jokingly referred to as " literary pope , " is a man of unbridled energy . as active as ever , he is currently editing " the canon of german literature , " which he sees as the crowning achievement of his career . " it is the fruit of a whole life devoted to literature , " he said himself . but he is also frank about his preoccupation with death . " i fear non-existence , " reich-ranicki has said .
" when life goes on and one does n't experience anything anymore , one is no longer there . " a holocaust survivor and a spy reich-ranicki was born on june 2 , 1920 in wloclawek , poland .

the dramatic outcome is summed up in dutch de telegraaf as a sign of a growing gap between the political elite and ordinary public .
" a massive no " trumpets its front page headline .
it cites independent mp geert wilders , who is planning to table a no-confidence vote , congratulating the voters and seeing now a " vast gap between politics and society " .
more distance , please germany 's berliner zeitung says the dutch had different motives for voting " no " than the french .
" unlike the french left , they do not find the eu too market friendly , but on the contrary , they find it too opposed to reform , " it says .
the paper says it is precisely these widely diverging views on the eu in both referendums that show the scale of the challenge facing europe .
the germans are well advised to slowly , with friendly words , free themselves from the french embrace die welt hamburg 's die welt is baffled by the stance french president jacques chirac has taken in response to the french ' no ' .
it says mr chirac caused astonishment by saying he would in future defend " national interests " within the european union .
" what has the french president being doing until now then ? " it wonders .
" in short : if chirac follows his words with actions , then the european union will really be in crisis .
the germans are well advised to slowly , with friendly words , free themselves from the french embrace .
" a little more distance would serve europe , and berlin , well . "
frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says that despite two television appearances , " both to the tones of the marseillaise " , mr chirac has yet to provide the french with a clear explanation as to how he intends to move the country forward .
scapegoat for france 's liberation : " the dutch , massive and final ' nee ' is a continuation in the catastrophic film in which the french ' non ' was the first episode .
france risks finding itself in the traditional anglo-saxon position with regard to europe : splendid isolation liberation the constitution served as a scapegoat in the hague , just as it did in paris , in the face of multiple contradictory protests , against elites , against foreigners , the cost of living , unemployment , enlargement , or the bureaucracy in brussels . "
looking ahead , it predicts : " once the road to political union has been cut off , the only plan b for europe will be tony blair 's , with a vast free-market zone , as unregulated as possible .
" france is against this ' anglo-saxon ' model .
but it risks finding itself in the traditional anglo-saxon position with regard to europe : splendid isolation . "
crisis or stagnation ?
swiss la tribune de geneve predicts that " what awaits is not a salutary crisis but at best a long period of stagnation " .
in spain , madrid 's el pais says the dutch voted chiefly against the government 's chosen economic path .
" to cap it all , they have had to tighten up public finances while france and germany have dispensed with complying with the rules of monetary union .
the high cost of living , linked to the introduction of the single currency , also influenced the protest , " the paper says .
the eu has historically shone thanks to its ability to compromise its way out of difficult problems information barcelona 's el periodico also follows the money angle , saying the french and dutch votes will strain relations between the rich and less rich eu member states .
" the day-to-day workings of the union will be more difficult in the rarefied atmosphere .
to begin with , the passing of the 2007-2013 six-year budget for which the countries who are net contributors want to pay less and in which the countries which benefit , such as spain , will face funding cuts , will be much more complicated . "
however , denmark 's information steps back and takes a hopeful look to the future .
" the eu has historically shone thanks to its ability to compromise its way out of difficult problems .
let us hope that this talent will also be enough this time , for europe 's sake , " it says .

the 34-year-old trainspotting and star wars actor plays gambler sky masterson in the revival of the 1950s musical at london 's piccadilly theatre .
after the opening night , mcgregor said : " the first night can sometimes be a bit uptight but tonight was fantastic . "
the audience included star wars co-star natalie portman , barbara windsor , joan collins and andrew lloyd webber .
ally mcbeal actress jane krakowski , douglas hodge and jenna russell co-star in the show .
mcgregor , returning to theatre after a six-year absence since appearing in little malcolm and his struggle against the eunuchs , performs famous numbers including luck be a lady .

joseph stephanides , who is alleged to have steered a lucrative contract to a british firm , is the first un employee sacked over the scandal .
mr annan concluded that mr stephanides , of cyprus , had breached un staff procurement rules , a spokesman said .
mr stephanides , 59 , rejected the charges and said he planned to appeal .
" i am very disappointed by this decision , " the un veteran of 25 years told the associated press news agency .
mr stephanides , who was head of the security council affairs division , said : " i look to the appeal process in the confident hope that justice will be made and i will be exonerated because i have committed no wrongdoing . "
his lawyer told reuters the decision to award the contract was made by mr stephanides ' superiors .
other investigations the oil-for-food -lrb- off -rrb- programme , which was supposed to allow iraq to buy humanitarian supplies with the proceeds of regulated oil sales during the sanctions of the 1990s , is subject to several investigations .
a number of individuals and businesses are accused of paying and receiving kickbacks for off contracts , or selling iraqi oil themselves at a profit .
joseph stephanides -lrb- left -rrb- denies any wrongdoing mr stephanides has been named by the un inquiry into the scandal - by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker - for allegedly colluding in 1996 to help uk firm lloyd 's register inspection win a major inspection contract .
mr annan 's spokesman stephane dujarric said mr stephanides was told of the secretary general 's decision on tuesday and " separated from service with immediate effect " .

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- wants the number of wildlife and geology sites doubled to 400 by the end of the decade .
it said only 6 % of land in northern ireland was protected for wildlife - the smallest area in the uk .
the charity is launching a campaign to raise awareness of site protection .
dr james robinson of the rspb said : " this is an extremely serious issue when you think about the importance of our natural heritage in maintaining our quality of life and attracting tourists to northern ireland .
" it is unacceptable that so little progress has been made on the declaration and protection of assis -lrb- areas of special scientific interest -rrb- over the last 20 years . "
dr robinson expressed concern that an rspb report , published almost 15 years ago , made exactly the same demands it was making today .
" in the report , the rspb said that the environment and heritage service needed to declare , monitor and protect all our nationally important sites , " he said .
lapwing numbers have fallen in northern ireland " the rate of declaration has been extremely slow , with only 17 sites declared over the last two years .
" at this rate , it will take at least 20 years to declare those sites that ehs has estimated require protection .
" we estimate that , in order for them to complete the declaration process by 2010 , over 30 sites need to be declared per year between now and then .
" we really want to see ehs succeed in meeting this target . "
the rspb said the significance of the protected sites could not be underestimated .
the copeland islands , off the county down coast , support about 2 % of the world breeding population of manx shearwaters .
in the autumn , strangford lough in county down , is home to almost the entire population of brent geese which migrate from breeding grounds in arctic canada .

theresia eirwen davies died in hospital in brighton last month .
miss davies ' distant cousin had desperately tried to find betty bowen , who was unknown to the family , so that she could pay her last respects .
her last request was to be buried in wales but she was due to be cremated in sussex until her relative stepped in .
the search for mrs bowen initially centred on powys but she was eventually traced to rhondda , near where miss davies grew up .
plans are now in place for two black belgian horses to draw miss davies ' funeral carriage when the former legal secretary is buried in treorchy cemetery on monday .
she will be laid to rest near the grave of her father , who died in the flu pandemic of 1918 , when she was just 10 years old .
third beneficiary bronwen sanders knew miss davies , her second cousin , as " aunty " .
she is also another beneficiary and said she was relieved to have tracked down mrs bowen , a former childhood friend of the late woman .
the search had centred on llansantffraid in powys where miss davies had retired , but after the story was published in a newspaper , mrs bowen was found in south wales .
mrs sanders , 53 , who now lives in eastbourne , said : " i also needed to discover the whereabouts of the third beneficiary of my aunt 's will .
the legal secretary wanted to be buried back in the rhondda " not necessarily in time for her funeral , not sure she would be alive but , if she was , i wanted to afford her every opportunity to say her last goodbyes . "
mrs bowen , from trealaw , is a former transport and general workers ' union shop steward who recruited more than 2,500 catering workers to the union and began a fight for their employment rights .
" do i remember miss davies ?
i 'll say i do !
theresia , as ronny , peggy and me best knew to call her .
girls together in the rhondda , until i 'm the sole survivor , " she said .
the search had followed a mix-up about the funeral plans for miss davies .
the former legal secretary was to be cremated until mrs sanders stepped in , maintaining that miss davies ' last request was to be buried near her father , william christmas davies , back in rhondda .
after a two-week delay , miss davies ' funeral cortege will leave east sussex for wales on friday afternoon .
the manager of a retirement complex where she lived , sue grisedale , believed it would be a comfort to her friends there to know miss davies was to buried back home in wales .
" one of its daughters is returning home at the end of a long life spent in east sussex as well as south and mid wales , " she said .

the first orbiting earth satellite and the first man in space took off from the centre , which is located in the steppes of neighbouring kazakhstan .
the russian president , vladimir putin , and his kazakh counterpart , nursultan nazarbayev , visited the site to take part in the anniversary celebrations .
baikonur is the world 's oldest space-launching facility .
the baikonur complex lies near the aral sea , deep in the arid wastes of the vast kazakh steppe .
soviet ruse this remote , top-secret site was chosen in 1955 to be the nerve centre for the former soviet union 's space programme .
the original kazakh town of baikonur it is named after in fact lies 400km -lrb- 250miles -rrb- to the north-east .
that was a soviet ruse to confuse anyone looking for the cosmodrome 's location .
the space centre notched up an impressive string of firsts in its early years .
the first satellite to orbit the earth , sputnik 1 , was launched from there in 1957 .
four years later , yuri gagarin blasted off to become the first man in space .
the first woman in space and the first person to walk in space also took off from baikonur .
when the ussr collapsed , many people thought it would mean the end for the cosmodrome , too .
but independent kazakhstan agreed to lease the site to russia .
that lease now extends until 2050 .
moscow has been developing another space centre , plesetsk , in the russian far north .
but its location makes it unfit for most commercial launches .
baikonur 's facilities are now in regular demand for commercial satellite launches and to supply the international space station now orbiting the earth .
kazakhstan also has plans to launch its own satellites from the complex and russia and kazakhstan together are developing a more environmentally friendly launch facility .
kazakhstan wants to reduce the pollution from rocket fuel and debris which often falls on its territory .

the first atomic clock , which uses the resonance frequencies of atoms to keep extremely precise time , was born at the uk 's national physical laboratory .
atomic clocks form the standard for coordinated universal time -lrb- utc -rrb- , which governs legal time-keeping globally .
the clocks are vital for rafts of technologies , such as global satellite navigation , and tv signal timings .
precise and accurate time-keeping is also essential for other synchronised events , such as the distribution and management of electricity , and financial transactions across the globe .
even london 's big ben relies on atomic clocks to keep it right .
the first accurate caesium atomic clock was developed at the npl in 1955 by dr louis essen .
but the idea was originally proposed by lord kelvin in 1879 .
he said that time-keeping based on how atoms behaved would be a better way to count time intervals than anything else .
" up until the introduction of the atomic clock , time definition was based on the rotation of the earth , " professor patrick gill , senior fellow at the lab , told the bbc news website .
" whilst that was reasonable , it did show variations and the point about using the atomic clock idea is that you are using a frequency which corresponds to the difference in energy of the ground state of atoms - it is pretty accurate compared with astronomical arrangements . "
" there is even talk of importing receivers into mobiles and having tiny atomic clocks onboard mobile handsets " professor patrick gill , npl navigating europe 's future atomic clocks are still much more constant than any other current method of time-keeping , although they are sensitive in a very small way to changes in electric and magnetic fields .
the development of the atomic clock was partly helped by technological advances such as radar during world war ii .
in the 50 years since the first atomic clock started counting , the devices have grown to be more than 100,000 times more precise .
atomic time is crucial for a plethora of telecommunications and computing applications , such as coordinating packets of data which are transferred across the net , global positioning satellite -lrb- gps -rrb- systems and mobile telephony .
as net data is split in data streams and reassembled , for instance , the timing has to correct at the point of re-assembly .
if not , whatever data has been sent - voice packets in voip net phone calls for example - will come out garbled .
atomic fountains now , using a beam of caesium-133 atoms , generated from a special type of oven , the best present-day atomic clocks are able to keep time to within a 10th of a billionth of a second a day .
they do this by counting time based on the way cooled-down caesium atoms jump back and forth between different energy levels .
this occurs at microwave frequencies , with nearly 9.2 billion jumps making up the interval of time known as the second .
atoms are cooled to narrow down the width of this " resonant frequency " .
the narrower that is , the more precise the measurement of time .
" essen 's initial idea made use of a horizontal beam of uncooled caesium atoms , which travelled across a metre or so .
he probed this with a microwave signal at two points along the way , " explained professor gill .
the current atomic clocks still use this method , but in a different kind of set-up , known as an " atomic fountain " .
" at the bottom of the fountain you have a cloud of a million atoms which are cooled by lasers - typically to micro-kelvin temperatures .
" we give them a little kick from below ; they travel up a metre in height and fall back down .
we then take microwaves and probe them on way up and down .
" from that double probing we can get a very narrow frequency . "
there are five or six standards labs worldwide which now have a similar fountain clock set-up , all contributing to utc .
there are a significant number of commercial atomic clocks in operation around the world , some of which also contribute to utc , but they are not as accurate , says professor gill .
know your place the next step professor gill and his team - and several other groups globally - have been developing replaces microwaves with much shorter wavelengths of laser light .
these optical clocks now under development operate at much higher frequencies and so allow for a much more precise description of time .
it is possible that optical clocks may replace the current microwave clocks as the primary standard of time in a decade or so .
optical atomic clocks , therefore , have greater potential in improving the performance of global positioning satellite systems to the sub-metre level , according to professor gill .
" the technology that uses the most accuracy it can get a hold of is satellite navigation , " said professor gill .
" what you have in the gps satellite systems are rubidium and caesium clocks .
those satellites which provide the basis for triangulation to receivers on the ground are also monitored by ground stations .
" within those there are master clocks which are more accurate than the satellite ones .
" that gives you typically some nano-seconds ' timing accuracy on the ground and relates to a positional precision of a few metres or so . "
as optical atomic clocks develop , however , they may start to appear in ground stations , then in future generations of satellite systems , which then means sub-metre precision location , even when an object or person is on the move .
this opens up all sorts of possibilities for the military , which heavily relies on gps , as well as more everyday uses in civil transport and location activities .
" there is even talk of importing receivers into mobiles and having tiny atomic clocks onboard mobile handsets , " said professor gill .
" they are not as accurate as caesium fountain systems , but they can be made small and could give local time for periods when your receiver could not see a satellite . "
in september 2004 , the us national institute of standards and technology -lrb- nist -rrb- used computer chip fabrication techniques to make a small atomic clock .
the final development should see a battery-operated system about the size of a sugar lump .

the first atomic clock , which uses the resonance frequencies of atoms to keep extremely precise time , was born at the uk 's national physical laboratory .
atomic clocks form the standard for coordinated universal time -lrb- utc -rrb- , which governs legal time-keeping globally .
the clocks are vital for rafts of technologies , such as global satellite navigation , and tv signal timings .
precise and accurate time-keeping is also essential for other synchronised events , such as the distribution and management of electricity , and financial transactions across the globe .
even london 's big ben relies on atomic clocks to keep it right .
the first accurate caesium atomic clock was developed at the npl in 1955 by dr louis essen .
atomic time how the modern world relies on atomic clocks to keep it ticking along at-a-glance but the idea was originally proposed by lord kelvin in 1879 .
he said that time-keeping based on how atoms behaved would be a better way to count time intervals than anything else .
" up until the introduction of the atomic clock , time definition was based on the rotation of the earth , " professor patrick gill , senior fellow at the lab , told the bbc news website .
" whilst that was reasonable , it did show variations and the point about using the atomic clock idea is that you are using a frequency which corresponds to the difference in energy of the ground state of atoms - it is pretty accurate compared with astronomical arrangements . "
there is even talk of importing receivers into mobiles and having tiny atomic clocks onboard mobile handsets professor patrick gill , npl navigating europe 's future atomic clocks are still much more constant than any other current method of time-keeping , although they are sensitive in a very small way to changes in electric and magnetic fields .
the development of the atomic clock was partly helped by technological advances such as radar during world war ii .
in the 50 years since the first atomic clock started counting , the devices have grown to be more than 100,000 times more precise .
atomic time is crucial for a plethora of telecommunications and computing applications , such as coordinating packets of data which are transferred across the net , global positioning satellite -lrb- gps -rrb- systems and mobile telephony .
as net data is split in data streams and reassembled , for instance , the timing has to correct at the point of re-assembly .
if not , whatever data has been sent - voice packets in voip net phone calls for example - will come out garbled .
atomic fountains now , using a beam of caesium-133 atoms , generated from a special type of oven , the best present-day atomic clocks are able to keep time to within a 10th of a billionth of a second a day .
they do this by counting time based on the way cooled-down caesium atoms jump back and forth between different energy levels .
this occurs at microwave frequencies , with nearly 9.2 billion jumps making up the interval of time known as the second .
atoms are cooled to narrow down the width of this " resonant frequency " .
the narrower that is , the more precise the measurement of time .
the next step comes in the form of optical clocks enlarge image " essen 's initial idea made use of a horizontal beam of uncooled caesium atoms , which travelled across a metre or so .
he probed this with a microwave signal at two points along the way , " explained professor gill .
the current atomic clocks still use this method , but in a different kind of set-up , known as an " atomic fountain " .
" at the bottom of the fountain you have a cloud of a million atoms which are cooled by lasers - typically to micro-kelvin temperatures .
" we give them a little kick from below ; they travel up a metre in height and fall back down .
we then take microwaves and probe them on way up and down .
" from that double probing we can get a very narrow frequency . "
there are five or six standards labs worldwide which now have a similar fountain clock set-up , all contributing to utc .
there are a significant number of commercial atomic clocks in operation around the world , some of which also contribute to utc , but they are not as accurate , says professor gill .
know your place the next step professor gill and his team - and several other groups globally - have been developing replaces microwaves with much shorter wavelengths of laser light .
these optical clocks now under development operate at much higher frequencies and so allow for a much more precise description of time .
it is possible that optical clocks may replace the current microwave clocks as the primary standard of time in a decade or so .
optical atomic clocks , therefore , have greater potential in improving the performance of global positioning satellite systems to the sub-metre level , according to professor gill .
the next generation of atomic clocks could be shrunk to fit in mobiles " the technology that uses the most accuracy it can get a hold of is satellite navigation , " said professor gill .
" what you have in the gps satellite systems are rubidium and caesium clocks .
those satellites which provide the basis for triangulation to receivers on the ground are also monitored by ground stations .
" within those there are master clocks which are more accurate than the satellite ones .
" that gives you typically some nano-seconds ' timing accuracy on the ground and relates to a positional precision of a few metres or so . "
as optical atomic clocks develop , however , they may start to appear in ground stations , then in future generations of satellite systems , which then means sub-metre precision location , even when an object or person is on the move .
this opens up all sorts of possibilities for the military , which heavily relies on gps , as well as more everyday uses in civil transport and location activities .
" there is even talk of importing receivers into mobiles and having tiny atomic clocks onboard mobile handsets , " said professor gill .
" they are not as accurate as caesium fountain systems , but they can be made small and could give local time for periods when your receiver could not see a satellite . "
in september 2004 , the us national institute of standards and technology -lrb- nist -rrb- used computer chip fabrication techniques to make a small atomic clock .
the final development should see a battery-operated system about the size of a sugar lump .

" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone ... "
but it is only in the past few years that helping out in the community has become a political idea in its own right - trumpeted by parties of all persuasions as a potential cure for society 's ills rather than just a private act of generosity or goodwill .
like most things in modern politics , this phenomenon can be traced back to margaret thatcher .
lady thatcher came to power in 1979 with a mission to shrink the state and , as she saw it , set people free from a suffocating reliance on central government or the local council to provide everything from housing to healthcare .
a keen advocate of victorian values , lady thatcher envisaged a return to an era of self-reliance and philanthropy - and a key part of this was what became known as the " voluntary sector " .
the next decade will be defined by a simple idea ; ' we are all in this together . '
tony blair in 1997 in a speech to the women 's royal voluntary service in 1981 , she said : " the willingness of men and women to give service is one of freedom 's greatest safeguards .
it ensures that caring remains free from political control . "
the reality behind such rhetoric was that charities and voluntary groups were often expected to step into the breach when the thatcher government cut spending on services .
civic bonds and , critics claimed , the greed and consumerism engendered by thatcherite economic policies succeeded in turning the uk into a more mean-spirited and uncharitable place to live .
when new labour came to power , it pledged to repair the community ties it believed had been shattered by thatcherism .
in one of his first speeches as prime minister in 1997 , tony blair told residents of the aylesbury estate , in south london : " the next decade will be defined by a simple idea : ' we are all in this together . '
" it will be about how to recreate the bonds of civic society and community in a way compatible with the far more individualistic nature of modern , economic , social and cultural life . "
but , for labour the voluntary sector , which had grown under the conservatives , was not the obvious choice for a means of achieving this .
underclass labour had created the welfare state , in part , to free the working class from the clutches of charity .
in 1988 , gordon brown described charity as a " sad and seedy competition for public pity " .
a golden thread runs through history , says gordon brown but in government mr brown , like the rest of new labour , began increasingly to see charity groups and voluntary participation as the answer to many of the social problems it was trying to get to grips with , such as the growth of a disenfranchised underclass with few links to mainstream society .
getting people out of their houses and flats - to join residents ' associations , community groups or even political parties - was seen as a way to combat fear of crime and improve the quality of life in labour 's working class heartlands .
but unlike in the days of old labour , ministers stressed the importance of informal , highly-localised initiatives , rather than centralised planning .
launching a campaign to increase voluntary participation in 2001 , mr brown said : " politicians once thought the man in whitehall knew best .
now we understand that the ... mother from the playgroup ... might know better . "
despite this rhetoric , new labour 's early years in government were marked by centrally-controlled , whitehall-devised initiatives designed to boost voluntary participation .
one such initiative , the experience corps , was launched in a blaze of publicity in 2000 .
the ideas was to recruit a " dad 's army " of the over 50s , tapping into the wealth of expertise and experience of people in later life .
voluntary activity the government spent £ 20m on the initiative but pulled the plug on funding in 2003 after it failed to meet its target of recruiting 250,000 volunteers .
the organisation has carried on as a " voice " for older volunteers , with funding from private industry .
in 2003 , the government set itself a target - the ultimate new labour token of intent - of increasing voluntary participation by 5 % by 2006 .
last year it claimed to be ahead of schedule , having succeeded in getting one million extra people involved in " community participation " .
but critics claimed the government 's definition of what counts as voluntary activity is so wide as to be almost meaningless .
brown 's vision according to the home office 's citizenship survey , volunteering includes " giving advice to someone " , " looking after property or a pet for someone who was away " , babysitting and " keeping in touch with someone " .
and , as the report concedes , extrapolating from survey percentages to the population of england as a whole is " not an exact science " .
nevertheless , as labour begins its third term , its vision of a society of active , engaged citizens pulling together to make life better for each other remains a key touchstone .
launching the year of the volunteer in january this year , mr brown said - contrary to a famous phrase attributed to margaret thatcher - " there is such a thing as society : a community of communities , tens of thousands of local neighbourhood civic associations , unions , charity , voluntary organizations and volunteers " .
but he added : " you do not rebuild communities from the top down .
you can only rebuild one street , one neighbourhood at a time " .
and he attempted to strike a prime ministerial note as he stressed the importance of the voluntary sector - and volunteering - to his vision of britain .
" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone , -lsb- but -rsb- i believe that there is indeed a golden thread which runs through british history not just of the individual standing firm for liberty but also of common endeavour in villages , towns and cities - men and women with shared needs and common purposes , united by a strong sense of duty and fair play . "
but the problem - outlined by mr blair in his speech on the aylesbury estate 1997 - of how to motivate an increasingly fractured and individualistic population to put aside their selfish concerns for the common good remains as real as ever .
and - as mr blair conceded during the recent election campaign - for the people living on that estate and others like it there is still a long way to go before it can be overcome .

despite this rhetoric , new labour 's early years in government were marked by centrally-controlled , whitehall-devised initiatives designed to boost voluntary participation .
one such initiative , the experience corps , was launched in a blaze of publicity in 2000 .
the ideas was to recruit a " dad 's army " of the over 50s , tapping into the wealth of expertise and experience of people in later life .
voluntary activity the government spent £ 20m on the initiative but pulled the plug on funding in 2003 after it failed to meet its target of recruiting 250,000 volunteers .
the organisation has carried on as a " voice " for older volunteers , with funding from private industry .
in 2003 , the government set itself a target - the ultimate new labour token of intent - of increasing voluntary participation by 5 % by 2006 .
last year it claimed to be ahead of schedule , having succeeded in getting one million extra people involved in " community participation " .
but critics claimed the government 's definition of what counts as voluntary activity is so wide as to be almost meaningless .
brown 's vision according to the home office 's citizenship survey , volunteering includes " giving advice to someone " , " looking after property or a pet for someone who was away " , babysitting and " keeping in touch with someone " .
and , as the report concedes , extrapolating from survey percentages to the population of england as a whole is " not an exact science " .
nevertheless , as labour begins its third term , its vision of a society of active , engaged citizens pulling together to make life better for each other remains a key touchstone .
launching the year of the volunteer in january this year , mr brown said - contrary to a famous phrase attributed to margaret thatcher - " there is such a thing as society : a community of communities , tens of thousands of local neighbourhood civic associations , unions , charity , voluntary organizations and volunteers " .
but he added : " you do not rebuild communities from the top down .
you can only rebuild one street , one neighbourhood at a time " .
and he attempted to strike a prime ministerial note as he stressed the importance of the voluntary sector - and volunteering - to his vision of britain .
" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone , -lsb- but -rsb- i believe that there is indeed a golden thread which runs through british history not just of the individual standing firm for liberty but also of common endeavour in villages , towns and cities - men and women with shared needs and common purposes , united by a strong sense of duty and fair play . "
but the problem - outlined by mr blair in his speech on the aylesbury estate 1997 - of how to motivate an increasingly fractured and individualistic population to put aside their selfish concerns for the common good remains as real as ever .
and - as mr blair conceded during the recent election campaign - for the people living on that estate and others like it there is still a long way to go before it can be overcome .

" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone ... "
but it is only in the past few years that helping out in the community has become a political idea in its own right - trumpeted by parties of all persuasions as a potential cure for society 's ills rather than just a private act of generosity or goodwill .
like most things in modern politics , this phenomenon can be traced back to margaret thatcher .
lady thatcher came to power in 1979 with a mission to shrink the state and , as she saw it , set people free from a suffocating reliance on central government or the local council to provide everything from housing to healthcare .
a keen advocate of victorian values , lady thatcher envisaged a return to an era of self-reliance and philanthropy - and a key part of this was what became known as the " voluntary sector " .
the next decade will be defined by a simple idea ; ' we are all in this together . '
tony blair in 1997 in a speech to the women 's royal voluntary service in 1981 , she said : " the willingness of men and women to give service is one of freedom 's greatest safeguards .
it ensures that caring remains free from political control . "
the reality behind such rhetoric was that charities and voluntary groups were often expected to step into the breach when the thatcher government cut spending on services .
civic bonds and , critics claimed , the greed and consumerism engendered by thatcherite economic policies succeeded in turning the uk into a more mean-spirited and uncharitable place to live .
when new labour came to power , it pledged to repair the community ties it believed had been shattered by thatcherism .
in one of his first speeches as prime minister in 1997 , tony blair told residents of the aylesbury estate , in south london : " the next decade will be defined by a simple idea : ' we are all in this together . '
" it will be about how to recreate the bonds of civic society and community in a way compatible with the far more individualistic nature of modern , economic , social and cultural life . "
but , for labour the voluntary sector , which had grown under the conservatives , was not the obvious choice for a means of achieving this .
underclass labour had created the welfare state , in part , to free the working class from the clutches of charity .
in 1988 , gordon brown described charity as a " sad and seedy competition for public pity " .
a golden thread runs through history , says gordon brown but in government mr brown , like the rest of new labour , began increasingly to see charity groups and voluntary participation as the answer to many of the social problems it was trying to get to grips with , such as the growth of a disenfranchised underclass with few links to mainstream society .
getting people out of their houses and flats - to join residents ' associations , community groups or even political parties - was seen as a way to combat fear of crime and improve the quality of life in labour 's working class heartlands .
but unlike in the days of old labour , ministers stressed the importance of informal , highly-localised initiatives , rather than centralised planning .
launching a campaign to increase voluntary participation in 2001 , mr brown said : " politicians once thought the man in whitehall knew best .
now we understand that the ... mother from the playgroup ... might know better . "
despite this rhetoric , new labour 's early years in government were marked by centrally-controlled , whitehall-devised initiatives designed to boost voluntary participation .

" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone ... "
but it is only in the past few years that helping out in the community has become a political idea in its own right - trumpeted by parties of all persuasions as a potential cure for society 's ills rather than just a private act of generosity or goodwill .
like most things in modern politics , this phenomenon can be traced back to margaret thatcher .
lady thatcher came to power in 1979 with a mission to shrink the state and , as she saw it , set people free from a suffocating reliance on central government or the local council to provide everything from housing to healthcare .
a keen advocate of victorian values , lady thatcher envisaged a return to an era of self-reliance and philanthropy - and a key part of this was what became known as the " voluntary sector " .
the next decade will be defined by a simple idea ; ' we are all in this together . '
tony blair in 1997 in a speech to the women 's royal voluntary service in 1981 , she said : " the willingness of men and women to give service is one of freedom 's greatest safeguards .
it ensures that caring remains free from political control . "
the reality behind such rhetoric was that charities and voluntary groups were often expected to step into the breach when the thatcher government cut spending on services .
civic bonds and , critics claimed , the greed and consumerism engendered by thatcherite economic policies succeeded in turning the uk into a more mean-spirited and uncharitable place to live .
when new labour came to power , it pledged to repair the community ties it believed had been shattered by thatcherism .
in one of his first speeches as prime minister in 1997 , tony blair told residents of the aylesbury estate , in south london : " the next decade will be defined by a simple idea : ' we are all in this together . '
" it will be about how to recreate the bonds of civic society and community in a way compatible with the far more individualistic nature of modern , economic , social and cultural life . "
but , for labour the voluntary sector , which had grown under the conservatives , was not the obvious choice for a means of achieving this .
underclass labour had created the welfare state , in part , to free the working class from the clutches of charity .
in 1988 , gordon brown described charity as a " sad and seedy competition for public pity " .
a golden thread runs through history , says gordon brown but in government mr brown , like the rest of new labour , began increasingly to see charity groups and voluntary participation as the answer to many of the social problems it was trying to get to grips with , such as the growth of a disenfranchised underclass with few links to mainstream society .
getting people out of their houses and flats - to join residents ' associations , community groups or even political parties - was seen as a way to combat fear of crime and improve the quality of life in labour 's working class heartlands .
but unlike in the days of old labour , ministers stressed the importance of informal , highly-localised initiatives , rather than centralised planning .
launching a campaign to increase voluntary participation in 2001 , mr brown said : " politicians once thought the man in whitehall knew best .
now we understand that the ... mother from the playgroup ... might know better . "
despite this rhetoric , new labour 's early years in government were marked by centrally-controlled , whitehall-devised initiatives designed to boost voluntary participation .
one such initiative , the experience corps , was launched in a blaze of publicity in 2000 .
the ideas was to recruit a " dad 's army " of the over 50s , tapping into the wealth of expertise and experience of people in later life .
voluntary activity the government spent £ 20m on the initiative but pulled the plug on funding in 2003 after it failed to meet its target of recruiting 250,000 volunteers .
the organisation has carried on as a " voice " for older volunteers , with funding from private industry .
in 2003 , the government set itself a target - the ultimate new labour token of intent - of increasing voluntary participation by 5 % by 2006 .
last year it claimed to be ahead of schedule , having succeeded in getting one million extra people involved in " community participation " .
but critics claimed the government 's definition of what counts as voluntary activity is so wide as to be almost meaningless .
brown 's vision according to the home office 's citizenship survey , volunteering includes " giving advice to someone " , " looking after property or a pet for someone who was away " , babysitting and " keeping in touch with someone " .
and , as the report concedes , extrapolating from survey percentages to the population of england as a whole is " not an exact science " .
nevertheless , as labour begins its third term , its vision of a society of active , engaged citizens pulling together to make life better for each other remains a key touchstone .
launching the year of the volunteer in january this year , mr brown said - contrary to a famous phrase attributed to margaret thatcher - " there is such a thing as society : a community of communities , tens of thousands of local neighbourhood civic associations , unions , charity , voluntary organizations and volunteers " .
but he added : " you do not rebuild communities from the top down .
you can only rebuild one street , one neighbourhood at a time " .
and he attempted to strike a prime ministerial note as he stressed the importance of the voluntary sector - and volunteering - to his vision of britain .
" it is easy to romanticise about a britain now gone , -lsb- but -rsb- i believe that there is indeed a golden thread which runs through british history not just of the individual standing firm for liberty but also of common endeavour in villages , towns and cities - men and women with shared needs and common purposes , united by a strong sense of duty and fair play . "
but the problem - outlined by mr blair in his speech on the aylesbury estate 1997 - of how to motivate an increasingly fractured and individualistic population to put aside their selfish concerns for the common good remains as real as ever .
and - as mr blair conceded during the recent election campaign - for the people living on that estate and others like it there is still a long way to go before it can be overcome .

ms jamieson used a holyrood debate to ask authorities to use new powers they have been given under the anti-social behaviour act .
there have been only a few cases of the legislation being exploited and she asked them to use it more extensively .
opposition parties said councils needed to be properly resourced and other existing laws needed to be enforced .
the scottish executive has enabled the legislation to be used across the country over the past eight months . "
a blanket ban on any of these provisions is not acceptable for the victims and communities which are suffering from the impact of anti-social behaviour " cathy jamieson justice minister ms jamieson said good progress was being made in tackling vandalism , noise , graffiti , fly-dumping , drinking and drugs .
there have been high-profile cases of dispersal zones against boy racers in aberdeen , a noisy neighbour having his flat closed down and troublesome vehicles being seized in fife .
' clear message ' however , in other parts of the country , most notably in glasgow , little use has been made of the new powers .
" we must all continue to do more , " the minister told msps .
" that 's why as local agencies finalise their asb -lrb- anti-social behaviour -rrb- strategies and outcome agreements , i want to send out a clear message to them that before we issue further funding in 2006 , i will be expecting them to ensure that where appropriate , they have used all the new powers they have at their disposal .
" a blanket ban on any of these provisions is not acceptable for the victims and communities which are suffering from the impact of anti-social behaviour . "
the scottish national party 's justice spokesman , kenny macaskill , said : " some antisocial behaviour is not criminal and it can not be dealt with simply by the police or by prosecution and we require further avenues to deal with it .
" local authorities must be properly resourced , not simply chastised and castigated for not dealing with matters . "
' naive ' claim bill aitken , tory msp for glasgow region , said it was " naive " to say the new legislation was a success after a short period .
tougher enforcement of other existing laws would be a faster and better way to deal with the problem .
patrick harvie , green msp for glasgow region , said the executive 's focus on enforcement failed to address the causes of bad behaviour .
shopkeepers are also urging councils to do more to help reduce vandalism and theft .
the scottish retail consortium wants local authorities to use the new powers to crack down on troublemakers .

should wales have a giant sculpture of a miner to greet visitors arriving over the second severn crossing ?
or how about remodelling mounds of earth in north wales on a druidic theme ?
these have been two of the suggestions after calls for a welsh icon .
deyan sudjic , architecture correspondent of the observer newspaper and author of the edifice complex , believes it is all over for the " icon " - or at least it should be .
" there 's something rather curious about the mania to build landmarks and icons .
it seems to betray a lack of confidence , " he said .
" a confident nation like wales does n't need a logo to say ' we 're here ' .
it does n't need to produce the kind of image you might find as a background to car commercials or inside a paperweight you might find at the seaside . "
charles jencks , however , strongly disagrees .
he himself is designing an iconic landmark for northumbria in england .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- what does dutch ' no ' vote mean ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 2 june , 2005 , 09:29 gmt 10:29 uk what does dutch ' no ' vote mean ?
voters in the netherlands have firmly rejected the european union constitution .
provisional final results indicated that 61.6 % of voters said " no " to the charter and 38.4 % approved it in the referendum on wednesday .
the vote was not binding , but prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would respect the result .
did you vote in the referendum ?
will the ratification of the treaty continue in other countries ?
what is the next step for the eu constitution ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : i wish i had the right to vote " no " too .
the greek parliament voted " yes " without asking greek citizens .
we are also misinformed .
the politicians must explain to us how expanding the eu will help our unemployment , our economy etc .
the same way our politicians must explain how the new constitution will improve the living standards for the current eu countries .
in greece we were always proud to be members of the eu family but now i feel jealous because the french and the dutch had the opportunity to say " no " to the eu politicians .
good work guys !
virginia , greece " the results are in and it is a big fat no " pepijn , hillegom the results are in and it is a big fat no , supported by a big turn-out .
i voted no even though i 'm a strong supporter of an united europe but i can not vote yes on such an unwieldy piece of legislature .
a constitution needs to be understandable , not an inches thick document that is a compromise of years of debate .
i do think that the result of the vote is largely based on a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the current government .
pepijn , hillegom 63 % to 37 % ?
that was to be expected .
how can one vote for a incomprehensible constitution on something that does n't even exist ?
there is no union in europe , which is deeply divided and can not even agree on a common foreign and defence policy , let alone a military force capable of actual combat .
what does exist , however , is the common market which will continue to function .
can the current european disunion be replaced one day by a real union ?
perhaps , but for that to occur people would have to start thinking of themselves and identify as europeans first , not as french , german , british , polish , etc. which is a case today .
it is not impossible , but it will take time and have to be a gradual process .
meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa " this is the final blow to the constitution " michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa " it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution " erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands " they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction " miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands " what we are doing is asking for clarification " johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands " it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason " wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands " i do not know what to vote " bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands " i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed " jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands " to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels " alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk " even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run " herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk " the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price " hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands " the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions " david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands " this is an ill-considered constitution " david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .

gm saw us sales in may fall by 5.5 % on the same month a year earlier , while ford 's dropped by 3 % .
by contrast , nissan saw its us sales rise by 15.5 % in may , while toyota gained 7.8 % and hyundai / kia almost 9 % .
the us firms ' focus on sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- has caused them trouble in the face of sky-high fuel prices .
analysts have said that in contrast to gm and ford 's suv-heavy line-up , their asian rivals have a wider range of fuel-efficient saloon cars too .
big discounts may 's fall in sales was the 12th straight decline for ford and the fourth in a row for gm .

chrysler boost yet other commentators cautioned that it was a short-term move which would most likely have a negative knock-on effect on sales in july and august - unless the price reductions were continued after the end of june .
ford has stayed in the black , but profits have almost halved overall annual us car sales totalled 16.7 million in may , down from 17.7 million in may of last year .

gm saw us sales in may fall by 5.5 % on the same month a year earlier , while ford 's dropped by 3 % .
by contrast , nissan saw its us sales rise by 15.5 % in may , while toyota gained 7.8 % and hyundai / kia almost 9 % .
the us firms ' focus on sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- has caused them trouble in the face of sky-high fuel prices .

big discounts may 's fall in sales was the 12th straight decline for ford and the fourth in a row for gm .

voters in the netherlands have firmly rejected the european union constitution .
provisional final results indicated that 61.6 % of voters said " no " to the charter and 38.4 % approved it in the referendum on wednesday .
the vote was not binding , but prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would respect the result .
did you vote in the referendum ?
will the ratification of the treaty continue in other countries ?
what is the next step for the eu constitution ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : i wish i had the right to vote " no " too .
the greek parliament voted " yes " without asking greek citizens .
we are also misinformed .
the politicians must explain to us how expanding the eu will help our unemployment , our economy etc .
the same way our politicians must explain how the new constitution will improve the living standards for the current eu countries .
in greece we were always proud to be members of the eu family but now i feel jealous because the french and the dutch had the opportunity to say " no " to the eu politicians .
good work guys !
virginia , greece the results are in and it is a big fat no pepijn , hillegom the results are in and it is a big fat no , supported by a big turn-out .
i voted no even though i 'm a strong supporter of an united europe but i can not vote yes on such an unwieldy piece of legislature .
a constitution needs to be understandable , not an inches thick document that is a compromise of years of debate .
i do think that the result of the vote is largely based on a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the current government .
pepijn , hillegom 63 % to 37 % ?
that was to be expected .
how can one vote for a incomprehensible constitution on something that does n't even exist ?
there is no union in europe , which is deeply divided and can not even agree on a common foreign and defence policy , let alone a military force capable of actual combat .
what does exist , however , is the common market which will continue to function .
can the current european disunion be replaced one day by a real union ?
perhaps , but for that to occur people would have to start thinking of themselves and identify as europeans first , not as french , german , british , polish , etc. which is a case today .
it is not impossible , but it will take time and have to be a gradual process .
meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa this is the final blow to the constitution michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands what we are doing is asking for clarification johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands i do not know what to vote bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands this is an ill-considered constitution david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .

voters in the netherlands have firmly rejected the european union constitution .
provisional final results indicated that 61.6 % of voters said " no " to the charter and 38.4 % approved it in the referendum on wednesday .
the vote was not binding , but prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would respect the result .
did you vote in the referendum ?
will the ratification of the treaty continue in other countries ?
what is the next step for the eu constitution ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : i wish i had the right to vote " no " too .
the greek parliament voted " yes " without asking greek citizens .
we are also misinformed .
the politicians must explain to us how expanding the eu will help our unemployment , our economy etc .
the same way our politicians must explain how the new constitution will improve the living standards for the current eu countries .
in greece we were always proud to be members of the eu family but now i feel jealous because the french and the dutch had the opportunity to say " no " to the eu politicians .
good work guys !
virginia , greece the results are in and it is a big fat no pepijn , hillegom the results are in and it is a big fat no , supported by a big turn-out .
i voted no even though i 'm a strong supporter of an united europe but i can not vote yes on such an unwieldy piece of legislature .
a constitution needs to be understandable , not an inches thick document that is a compromise of years of debate .
i do think that the result of the vote is largely based on a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the current government .
pepijn , hillegom 63 % to 37 % ?
that was to be expected .
how can one vote for a incomprehensible constitution on something that does n't even exist ?
there is no union in europe , which is deeply divided and can not even agree on a common foreign and defence policy , let alone a military force capable of actual combat .
what does exist , however , is the common market which will continue to function .
can the current european disunion be replaced one day by a real union ?
perhaps , but for that to occur people would have to start thinking of themselves and identify as europeans first , not as french , german , british , polish , etc. which is a case today .
it is not impossible , but it will take time and have to be a gradual process .
meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa this is the final blow to the constitution michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands what we are doing is asking for clarification johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands i do not know what to vote bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands this is an ill-considered constitution david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .

meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa this is the final blow to the constitution michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands what we are doing is asking for clarification johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands i do not know what to vote bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands this is an ill-considered constitution david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .

voters in the netherlands have firmly rejected the european union constitution .
provisional final results indicated that 61.6 % of voters said " no " to the charter and 38.4 % approved it in the referendum on wednesday .
the vote was not binding , but prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would respect the result .
did you vote in the referendum ?
will the ratification of the treaty continue in other countries ?
what is the next step for the eu constitution ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : i wish i had the right to vote " no " too .
the greek parliament voted " yes " without asking greek citizens .
we are also misinformed .
the politicians must explain to us how expanding the eu will help our unemployment , our economy etc .
the same way our politicians must explain how the new constitution will improve the living standards for the current eu countries .
in greece we were always proud to be members of the eu family but now i feel jealous because the french and the dutch had the opportunity to say " no " to the eu politicians .
good work guys !
virginia , greece the results are in and it is a big fat no pepijn , hillegom the results are in and it is a big fat no , supported by a big turn-out .
i voted no even though i 'm a strong supporter of an united europe but i can not vote yes on such an unwieldy piece of legislature .
a constitution needs to be understandable , not an inches thick document that is a compromise of years of debate .
i do think that the result of the vote is largely based on a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the current government .
pepijn , hillegom 63 % to 37 % ?
that was to be expected .
how can one vote for a incomprehensible constitution on something that does n't even exist ?
there is no union in europe , which is deeply divided and can not even agree on a common foreign and defence policy , let alone a military force capable of actual combat .
what does exist , however , is the common market which will continue to function .
can the current european disunion be replaced one day by a real union ?
perhaps , but for that to occur people would have to start thinking of themselves and identify as europeans first , not as french , german , british , polish , etc. which is a case today .
it is not impossible , but it will take time and have to be a gradual process .
meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa this is the final blow to the constitution michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands what we are doing is asking for clarification johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands i do not know what to vote bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands this is an ill-considered constitution david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .

voters in the netherlands have firmly rejected the european union constitution .
provisional final results indicated that 61.6 % of voters said " no " to the charter and 38.4 % approved it in the referendum on wednesday .
the vote was not binding , but prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would respect the result .
did you vote in the referendum ?
will the ratification of the treaty continue in other countries ?
what is the next step for the eu constitution ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : i wish i had the right to vote " no " too .
the greek parliament voted " yes " without asking greek citizens .
we are also misinformed .
the politicians must explain to us how expanding the eu will help our unemployment , our economy etc .
the same way our politicians must explain how the new constitution will improve the living standards for the current eu countries .
in greece we were always proud to be members of the eu family but now i feel jealous because the french and the dutch had the opportunity to say " no " to the eu politicians .
good work guys !
virginia , greece the results are in and it is a big fat no pepijn , hillegom the results are in and it is a big fat no , supported by a big turn-out .
i voted no even though i 'm a strong supporter of an united europe but i can not vote yes on such an unwieldy piece of legislature .
a constitution needs to be understandable , not an inches thick document that is a compromise of years of debate .
i do think that the result of the vote is largely based on a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the current government .
pepijn , hillegom 63 % to 37 % ?
that was to be expected .
how can one vote for a incomprehensible constitution on something that does n't even exist ?
there is no union in europe , which is deeply divided and can not even agree on a common foreign and defence policy , let alone a military force capable of actual combat .
what does exist , however , is the common market which will continue to function .
can the current european disunion be replaced one day by a real union ?
perhaps , but for that to occur people would have to start thinking of themselves and identify as europeans first , not as french , german , british , polish , etc. which is a case today .
it is not impossible , but it will take time and have to be a gradual process .
meerkat , alexandria , va , usa a yes vote has the advantage of being clear .
a no vote creates a new question .
a question that has to be answered .
what part of the constitution treaty can stay , what part should be changed ?
and how should it be changed .
i think a second referendum is unavoidable .
jan feytens , antwerp belgium the dutch and french have made the correct decision .
a country should n't voluntarily surrender sovereignty , regardless of the potential financial benefit .
unfortunately the rejection will not solve the basic problem of a non-competitive welfare based work environment which is not sustainable in the 21st century .
jack arata , new york , usa this is the final blow to the constitution michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus this is the final blow to the constitution .
europe has spoken loud and clear .
it is time for change or else the eu can not survive .
michael koumenides , nicosia , cyprus there is simply insufficient democracy in the eu for it to survive .
for too long it has been run by a small unrepresentative and unaccountable " elite " .
the combined effect of the french and dutch vote may allow this to be corrected .
lets hope so .
cliff , gravesend uk it must be an odd feeling - going out to vote in favour or against a constitution , since the french result , is effectively dead anyway .
tony stephenson , newcastle upon tyne , england i think the dutch and french vote was great .
for the first time , the people have let their views known about the eu .
it all begs the question : was the eu ever wanted by the middle class of europe ?
steve lowery , los angeles , usa it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i 've voted a strong ' no ' today .
it 's not that i am against europe , but i am against this constitution .
i often hear that a no vote is a vote against europe or the euro , but i think this is not the case -lrb- at least for me -rrb- .
there are factual arguments against this constitution -lrb- liberalisation is for me the main argument against -rrb- and i 've heard no factual argument in favour .
erik , ijsselstein , netherlands i have voted ' ja ' because i think this draft constitution does improve some things in europe and wo n't turn europe into the monster many ' nee ' campaigners have made out of it .
but three days after the french ' non ' , which i do respect , it feels like i 'm voting on a dying patient .
and i think my feeling is right .
phil , den haag , netherlands united we stand , divided we fall .
if europe wants to be taken as a serious global player , economically and otherwise , we have to unite or we will fall behind the other major global players like the u.s , japan or china .
i think we have to decide what we want but to stay as small states is not an option .
the problem is we all have had far too many bad experiences with each other in the past that we do n't seems to be able to let go of .
matt , london i voted " ja " .
i think it is foolish to let the voting on the eu constitution be led by the disillusion with the balkenede administration .
there will be an opportunity to change the government , in 2007 if the cabinet does n't fall before .
the constitution is not perfect , but it never will be as it has to be a consensus .
as it stands it appears to improve the democratic transparency .
spelling out constitutional rights is always worthwhile , especially when dealing with potentially problematic new countries joining , like turkey .
linda , cambridge , uk / amsterdam , nl i live in amsterdam and have done the past four years .
my girlfriend , a dutch lawyer , was in the dressing room of a department store the other day when she overheard two shop assistants .
one saying to the other " which way are you voting ? " .
" i 'm going to vote no " says the second .
first : " why ? "
second : " because everyone wants us to vote yes " .
this is the mentality we are dealing with here .
simon goetzel , amsterdam , the netherlands they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction miklos , leiden , netherlands i think that many people will voice their malcontent -lrb- over the euro and the economy -rrb- with a " no ' .
and that is a pity , because i think that they are using the wrong means to voice their dissatisfaction , and thereby possibly jeopardising future dutch credibility in the eu .
miklos , leiden , netherlands as a dutchman in sweden -lrb- so not able to vote -rrb- i would have voted ' no ' , but with mixed feelings about it .
the problems i have with the proposed constitution are that it gives even more power to ' bruxelles ' .
in itself it would be good if the european parliament had more power , as they might have been able to -lrb- for instance -rrb- keep the european commission from ramming through the ' software patents ' proposal .
had the constitution been limited to making the eu a more democratic institution i would have voted ' yes ' , but alas ...
frank de lange , sweden i have struggled to understand the dutch consensus on the eu vote .
is it a vote on the eu constitution or is this an opportunity for the disgruntled masses to push their own agenda ?
referendums are a precarious form of people politics .
niall , leiden , netherlands -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i voted ' no ' on the constitution , because i do n't want to increase the military capacity here and because i think it is not democratic -lrb- because the parliament can not propose policy and can not send a commission member home -rrb- .
the campaign here in the netherlands was terrible .
they tried scaring no-voters into voting yes and pretended that all no-voters were going to vote no for reasons outside of the referendum .
this has done the yes-side no good .
jesse , utrecht , netherlands it 's a shame when my country rejects this constitution .
people , for example , fear that the country will lose its influence in the union with this constitution .
but saying no to this , takes away our voice and we will indeed lose our say .
so my vote 's a yes this afternoon !
jorn , amsterdam , the netherlands what we are doing is asking for clarification johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands we in holland are neither accepting nor rejecting the eu constitution .
what we are doing is asking for clarification .
we have never been informed or consulted in all these years regarding the eu , at all .
now the government has proposed a 2 inch thick constitution and given the dutch citizens a 3 page pamphlet explaining the whys and why nots .
we in holland have been ill-informed and mis-informed for two decades and the result is that we now have a monster in brussels -lrb- or is it strasbourg ? -rrb- .
i urge the british to debate more and demand more before they decide .
johan pranger , utrecht , the netherlands have just been to the netherlands for the past week .
wherever people were talking about the eu referendum the general opinion was that they would say no .
also , it seems a higher percentage of people are voting in this referendum , than generally do for national / regional and local elections .
maybe it 's due to everything that has happened in the country over the past couple of years -lrb- political murders , growing intolerance , change to euro currency etc -rrb- .
dutch citizens are fed up with being part of europe and being controlled by some far and distant euro-government as well as feeling they have to finance poorer euro-members .
being dutch myself and moving to the uk has solved that problem for me .
amber , bournemouth , uk whatever happens today , the ' no ' camp will wake up tomorrow with the netherlands still a member of the eu , an unwieldy and impersonal organisation which is palpably not living up to its original ideals .
at some point the no campaigners will have to start presenting some positive and new proposals for the future of europe , rather than relying on a negative rhetoric based on rejection .
rob oliver , leiden , netherlands i have voted ja / yes , because i am convinced that this draft constitution is at least a step forward on the road to european integration .
i do n't want a federalist europe , but we will have to increase the level of cooperation if we want to achieve anything in this globalising world .
i 'll vote against our present government in our next general election , whenever that may come !
hans hulswit , papendrecht , netherlands living in the states , i 'm used to scary politicians .
mr balkenende has underestimated the dutch - we will not be scared !
no it is !
nanda , nj , usa / ex nl i think the dutch will definitely and definitively vote no .
since moving to the netherlands ten years ago i 've seen amazing changes most particularly in dutch attitudes towards foreigners and therefore how they see themselves .
once a open society with a large national door open to others less fortunate than themselves the dutch now think themselves as a nation threatened by an uncontrollable influx of both legal and illegal outsiders which have cost the taxpayer both in his pocket and with the decreasing quality and reliability of social services .
the no will reflect this fear rather than indicate whether or not the eu constitution should be ratified .
p. m. , rotterdam , netherlands it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason wies , reading , berkshire as a dutch woman living in the uk at the moment , i am sorry to see that my fellow countrymen have become so negative about the eu and especially about this constitution .
i think it is a shame that people are using their vote for the wrong reason , which is , to vote ' no ' just because they want to show our politicians that they disagree with the euro or turkey joining , or that they feel holland is losing its identity .
come on !
that 's not what this referendum is about !
it simply asks you if you think we should ratify the constitution - which is about streamlining the eu after last year 's enlargement .
wies , reading , berkshire most politicians in the news seem to think that there is no solution to the current crisis because populations of different countries and groups within them have wildly different views on the future direction of the union .
well , one way out could be that the eu takes its guiding principle of subsidiarity much more serious than it has done so far .
and it would also help if the countries would no longer keep themselves busy competing for money handed out by brussels .
they might find time to solve the big issues together !
cees de valk , den haag , netherlands today , i 'll also be voting against the constitution .
the eu started as an agreement on economical affairs and that 's what it should be , nothing more , nothing less .
irene schipper , amsterdam , the netherlands i lived in holland with my family for 20 years as a european civil servant .
the experience has left us with a love of the country such that we return every year to see friends .
since the euro decision i hear massive complaints from them that they were lied to about the effects .
the country always had jobs , a solid currency , trade surplus and is now in annual debt .
the dutch will rightly vote " nee " and not be scared to do so .
robin , abingdon , uk i think -lrb- and hope -rrb- the outcome will be a definite ' no ' .
hopefully this will force both the dutch and brussels politicians to start doing the thing they 're being paid for , to stop ignoring the people and to regret the condescending sneers they directed towards the no-voters .
helen , amsterdam , netherlands i do not know what to vote bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands i have deeply reflected on my choice , listened to politicians etc on the radio and on the television .
i have read the papers and discussed with friends and colleagues .
i consider myself an average person .
yet after all this , i do not know what to vote .
maybe that is a message in itself ?
bruce michielsen , nijmegen , netherlands people are mistaken if they think a nee is a no against europe .
it 's not .
but i 'm fed up with the money wasting and arrogance from overpaid people discussing chocolate cigarettes and things like that .
the eu is ok , as long as it goes about economic cooperation .
the eu of this moment is n't about that .
besides , the constitution , -lrb- grondwet in dutch main law -rrb- is n't a constitution at all .
so why vote for something not real ?
n. klaus , dordrecht the eu constitution is part of a process .
it is this process that made me vote no .
we can not operate without a united europe - it guarantees prosperity and peace .
but expanding the eu with 10 new members in combination with more subjects to discuss in brussels is too much to handle .
keep the eu small in number of countries or limit the competence of the eu to defence , economics , foreign affairs and environment .
and why do n't we have a referendum on the eu constitution throughout europe , all in the same way and on the same day ?
paul de bruijn , netherlands i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl as an english guy working here in nl , i conducted a highly unscientific poll in my local last night .
i do n't think the constitution has a hope of being passed .
the main reason ?
the patronising tone of the ja camp , compared with actual arguments from the nee side .
jeremy sharpe , utrecht , nl of course i am in favour of european cooperation , as this is necessary .
but to me it appears that a european constitution is a preamble to the founding of a federal european state .
because of the variety in language , culture and history between the independent european states i think this is undesirable .
therefore i voted no .
robin s. mulder , pijnacker , netherlands presumably the netherlands will follow france and vote no .
one comment from a british-born europhile , looking on at a distance from jerusalem .
when british politicians travel to france to join in the " no " campaign there , and when dutch and french voters look at each other and listen to each other 's arguments , and when the french referendum is followed closely in britain ... then whatever way the vote goes , has n't anyone notice that europe is indeed a reality ?
paul rose , jerusalem based on initial reactions i am afraid that my fellow countrymen will vote " no " today .
unfortunately most people will have voted no for the wrong reasons as they base their vote on disagreement with our current government , disagreement with eu policies and xenophobic fears .
too few people realise that with the current constitution you will get a leaner , more transparent and thus less costly eu .
stefan , amsterdam , the netherlands the european constitution is a threat to the independence of our liberal and democratic country .
if the bureaucracy in brussels - the headquarters of the eu - becomes more powerful , that will mean a loss of individual freedom and rights .
the constitution only serves the interests of multinationals and the happy few .
moreover , our very unpopular pm jp balkenende , our harry potter look-alike , should be given a clear message from his own countrymen that his rightist policies do n't reflect the opinion of the vast majority of the voters .
that 's why i voted ' nee ' to this european constitution , like some 60 % of the dutch voters .
hendrik klaassens , leeuwarden , the netherlands to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels alex powell , utrecht the dutch were never given the chance to vote on the introduction of the euro so there was never any real debate .
since then many thousands of jobs have been lost and everything is more expensive .
the french , germans and italians together have fudged the stability pact which would have never been allowed if it had been one of the smaller nations and the unelected commission has legislative powers whilst its members enjoy immunity from prosecution for life .
many people on this side of the channel are realising that to be truly european does n't mean that you have blindly accept all that comes out of brussels .
alex powell , utrecht the proposed constitution contains both positive -lrb- institutional -rrb- and negative -lrb- agricultural , anti-democratic -rrb- issues .
the negative ones weigh too heavy in my opinion to vote in favour of the positive ones , and i think the eu can easily implement the positive issues by means of regular treaties and igcs .
a no-vote is not a lost chance .
martijn veening , groningen , netherlands it is time for the eu to install a truly democratic and accountable " government " .
the dutch with the highest contribution per citizen should wonder where their money is going .
a no vote could signal that the eu has to become a direct representation of its citizens and not of the governments .
robbert van der bij , london poland and spain get a 10 % vote in europe .
the netherlands. a big economy , share 23 % voting rights with 19 small countries .
this is n't the euro song contest , but balkenende politics .
evers , netherlands i 'm another british expat working in the netherlands .
many dutch people are angry that the euro made things very expensive for a time but they forget that it was dutch companies taking advantage of the changeover that caused the problem , and the fact is recent supermarket price wars have all but eradicated this now anyway .
the other main reason is based upon a feeling that the government do n't listen to the people , but the people voted for a party headed by a man who had been murdered weeks before the election .
if the people do n't like who they put in office then they should vote more wisely in future instead of wasting everyone 's time voting no to the completely unrelated constitution .
jennifer , netherlands , ex-uk even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i hope that my countrymen vote no on the eu constitution by at least a 60-40 margin .
it would be the perfect message to send to the high-paid , lazy eurocrats working in brussels that even the most pro-european countries are fed up with the way the eu is being run .
my friends in the us believe that their politicians in washington are out of touch with reality , but i tell them that they need to see the situation in brussels to find politicians that are really out of touch with their home countries .
herman nooi , luxembourg -lrb- ex-netherlands -rrb- i will voting against the constitution , because it 's not clear to me what it can do for me .
of course balkendende is going to say that it is good for us to vote yes but the government told us also that the euro would be a good thing for us , but life got so much more expensive since the euro that i do n't belief that this constitution is going to be good for me .
dave zegers , the hague netherlands what is happening is complete insanity !
people forget how hard europe had to fight to get to where we are today .
and they want to throw us back to the stone age !
the french and dutch seem to believe that voting for racist and extreme right wing parties will solve their problems .
the actual problem of course is the neo-liberal attack on human and worker rights thus right wing parties will only make things worse .
europe needs to integrate more in order to achieve prosperity .
vangelis , london , uk the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price hidde , cambridge , uk the dutch are angry .
there are many good things in the constitution , such as more power for the european parliament , a better voting system , and more collaboration of police forces , defence and foreign policy .
as dutchman i would vote for this but the referendum seems to be about the cup of coffee that doubled in price , the european bureaucracy money wastage , the avalanche of rules and regulations , the accession of large muslim countries and the unwillingness of large countries to pay their due -lrb- so that we pay too much to the eu -rrb- .
when politicians address the above issues , the dutch just might give the eu a second chance .
hidde , cambridge , uk i just came back from voting against the constitution .
i feel many people will base their vote on their opinion of the dutch government , which is very low .
still , i also think that many dutch people have a clear idea about what this constitution entails , and in many ways it could be a product from the dutch government alone in its over-the-top liberalism , bureaucracy and economic policies .
i 'm expecting -lrb- and hoping for -rrb- a 60 % victory of those against it .
mark , groningen , the netherlands my guess is that " yes " will prevail 51-49 % .
if so , the eu has received a slap on the wrists by the french .
the netherlands is too dependent on international trade to turn its back on europe .
if a " nee " vote is the result , the eurocrats in brussels will have a serious problem .
however , the treaty is sound and an improvement .
i voted in favour .
frank van dijk , leiden i voted " no " , although i am in favour of having a constitution .
having read the whole document , i feel it is not very democratic .
parliament can not introduce legislation , but depends on the commission for proposals .
this gives the commission an effective veto over all activities of the eu , which is more than the member states will have .
also , i feel it is unwise to include policy -lrb- the collection of existing treaties -rrb- into the constitution .
peter kievits , eindhoven , the netherlands the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions david , uk as a brit working in the netherlands you become aware that the dutch objection is different from the french objection which seems to be based mainly on a horror of being required to earn their living in the world !
the dutch by contrast are simply exasperated by the cost and waste of eu institutions , to which they contribute an unreasonably large amount of money .
a dutch rejection should kill the treaty in its current form , but let 's hope that it does n't kill off the modernisation and reform of european economies .
let the french stagnate quietly in their protectionist fortress .
the dutch are highly successful traders and understand better than most the need for a fair and open market within europe is the means by which we can all safeguard our futures .
david , uk -lrb- currently netherlands -rrb- as with most things in politics , the politicians will simply ignore what they do n't want until they can change the rules .
if every single country voted " no " they would still find a way to get it through .
i have lost faith in the political process .
cam berwick , chester , uk unfortunately , the reasons for voting " nee " vary immensely .
i am afraid that my vote today -lrb- " nee " based on the contents of this constitution , e.g. militarization , lack of democracy -rrb- will be seen as a " nee " to europe .
and that our own pm will be the first to state that most people will have opposed on irrational grounds .
earlier mr balkenende stated that , " if it 's a no , i will look like a fool in brussels . "
if i needed an irrational reason to vote " nee " , this would certainly be it .
this man and -lrb- most of -rrb- his government are truly incapable to really listen to the people .
barbara , eindhoven , the netherlands this is an ill-considered constitution david ball , wokingham , uk as with the french , the dutch eu vote will send a message to their government that they ignore the people at their peril .
this is an ill-considered constitution that is incapable of implementation and it seems only the people realise this .
does n't say much for those in government .
david ball , wokingham , uk as a dutch man working in britain , i can only see in a bemused way that european politicians have lost touch with the very people they represent .
i believe people are waking up to the realisation of loss of identity , lack of self control and not in the least the hints of cronyism and financial self enrichment in these so called upper echelons of democracy that has emerged off late .
of course the dutch vote no .
for centuries , as a small nation the dutch have relied on politics , trade and tolerance to build their nation , not for it to be smothered in the eurosauce !
jilles edema , aberdeen , uk the constitution is too complicated for the ' average citizen ' .
so now we have to vote based on the trust that what the politicians advise is good .
this trust is a bit thin at the moment .
the government in holland did not really start to campaign for a yes until polls seriously predicted a ' nee " .
this sent yet another signal of arrogance towards the general public .
so now we have to vote according to our feelings , because the real facts of the constitution are simply not known / understood .
mauro , a 'dam , netherlands i think it will be a " no " vote on wednesday .
another message to brussels to clean up the acts and stop wasting our tax money .
harry , antwerp , bel .
the dutch will follow the lead of france and vote no .
mainly because the vote is being held without the characteristic predictions of doom or spiteful recriminations from the pro-government , europhile campaign and so will be an honest reflection of the views of european citizens .
jason , manchester i predict a " nee " vote 60 % -40 % .
the referendum in france will have had a big effect on the outcome of the dutch referendum .
