but potential buyers do n't seem to be interested . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker , is having difficulty persuading a buyer to take over its car-leasing subsidiary europcar , financial times deutschland reported on monday , quoting company sources . vw , in the middle of restructuring , said in september that it was reviewing " all options , ranging from strategic expansion to an initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- or sale , with regard to the wholly-owned subsidiaries gedas and europcar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 non-traditional burials gain popularity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anonymous " peace forests " are becoming increasingly popular the church holiday of all saints is a day when loved ones remember deceased relatives and care for their graves .
more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .
joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .
" now it 's also those of us who are left behind who need a ritual .

more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .
joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .
" now it 's also those of us who are left behind who need a ritual .

deutsche telekom believes it 's turning one of berlin 's iconic landmarks into a big pink football . for international soccer players , the world cup is the highest point of their playing days .
whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .

" the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

" this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet .

if one is formed , that is . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d from hamburg described müntefering 's stepping down as a " bizarre spectacle " with potentially serious consequences .
" in its strategic confusion , spd accidentally knocked over its party president , who was willing and supposed to lead the party into the grand coalition .
the fall of franz müntefering is the worst possible accident for spd , and it also batters the future coalition , before it even got to be formed properly .
the chancellor-to-be angela merkel is suddenly left without a vice-chancellor who could keep his party in line with the coalition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with müntefering gone , who will merkel rely on as her vice-chancellor ?
in a similar vein , the berlin daily taz described müntefering 's departure as a " misfortune for the spd , which has already been disheveled by schröder 's ego trips .
müntefering epitomizes better than anybody else the social-democratic virtues : reliability and unpretentiousness .
who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?

" this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .

the new identity document contains biometric data , which supporters say will protect against forgery , make identity checks and border controls easier and help police to track criminals .
but data protection campaigners remain worried about who can get their hands on the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passports ought to make border control easier outgoing german interior minister otto schily has been one of the main supporters of the new electronic passport .
for his efforts , privacy campaigners awarded him the big brother lifetime award - an ironic trophy inspired by george orwell 's famous anti-utopian novel " 1984 " - for , among other things , " the overhasty introduction of the electronic passport with poorly conceived technology and without parliamentary legitimacy . " schily 's confidence in electronic documents , however , has not been shaken . " i believe the security benefits for everyone are clear-cut , so i can ’ t understand why anyone would raise doubts , " schily said . according to schily , the new passports will help prevent forgery and fraud and make it easier to track criminals . " with modern methods of biometric identification , it ’ s obviously easier to find out whether a particular document is the one that was actually issued to a person and whether a person standing in front of you is who they say they are , " schily said . how will it all work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufhansa is testing tickets encoded with thumbprint data by the summer of 2006 , all new eu passports will contain a special chip which stores a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .
when someone presents that passport , a facial recognition system measures and records the distance between their features - mouth , eyes , nose , forehead and chin .
these features are unique for each person , so the data can be compared with what is stored in the passport to make sure people are who they say they are . one reason for the new eu passport rules is heightened security concerns after the sept .

if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .

however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 opinion : germany 's election aftershock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided it 's time to go social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader franz müntefering was right to step down after losing the inner-party power struggle over the post of secretary general .
but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .

" the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .
joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .

" franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .

merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high .

" resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .

" our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

deutsche telekom believes it 's turning one of berlin 's iconic landmarks into a big pink football . for international soccer players , the world cup is the highest point of their playing days .
whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .
the 32-meter square ball atop the tower may be just one of a number of globes getting the telekom treatment in the run up to the world cup . " the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .
lawyers in the case are hoping for up to 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- in compensation . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the quest for gold left lives in ruins more than 160 athletes from the former east germany are demanding compensation for the effects of performance-enhancing drugs they were made to take , often as children .

deutsche telekom believes it 's turning one of berlin 's iconic landmarks into a big pink football . for international soccer players , the world cup is the highest point of their playing days .
whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .
the 32-meter square ball atop the tower may be just one of a number of globes getting the telekom treatment in the run up to the world cup . " the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .

with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 press review : bizarre spectacle of german politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering seems ready to vanish from the spd 's leadership the german press reacted with bafflement to franz müntefering 's decision to step down as spd leader , since the untimely power struggle within spd could only destabilize the future government .
if one is formed , that is . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d from hamburg described müntefering 's stepping down as a " bizarre spectacle " with potentially serious consequences .
" in its strategic confusion , spd accidentally knocked over its party president , who was willing and supposed to lead the party into the grand coalition .
the fall of franz müntefering is the worst possible accident for spd , and it also batters the future coalition , before it even got to be formed properly .
the chancellor-to-be angela merkel is suddenly left without a vice-chancellor who could keep his party in line with the coalition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with müntefering gone , who will merkel rely on as her vice-chancellor ?
in a similar vein , the berlin daily taz described müntefering 's departure as a " misfortune for the spd , which has already been disheveled by schröder 's ego trips .
müntefering epitomizes better than anybody else the social-democratic virtues : reliability and unpretentiousness .
who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?
hardly .
the whole construction of the grand coalition may break down without müntefering .
that would be a victory of the irrational over the rational .
spd does n't seem to understand itself these days . " questio n i n g the sa n ity of it all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles : future spd secretary general ?
the popular german tabloid bild came out on tuesday morning with a picture of franz müntefering on its title page and the headline " are you politicians crazy ? "
stressing the fact that " politicians without power " would be participating in the coalition negotiations with the " helpless " angela merkel , bild commented on müntefering 's pulling out as a bad omen : " this is bad for spd , it 's bad for further coalition negotiations , and , therefore , bad for the country … franz müntefering was anything but an easy partner for cdu / csu .
but with the old-school ' leftie ' from north rhine-westphalia , one was reasonably certain that there could be no red-red-green -lrb- coalition between spd , former communist left party and the green party -rrb- .
since yesterday , no cdu politician would be willing to bet on it . " neue presse from hanover emphasized the self-destructive nature of the spd inner politics : " the result of this impressive demonstration of the social-democratic joy of losing is the total chaos in the now leaderless spd .
and , what 's even worse , in berlin .
the timidly sprouting hopes for a thriving government cooperation of the two big parties are again called into question .
the grand coalition is in crisis before it even started .
the would-be-vice-chancellor müntefering is at a breaking point .
stoiber , still a wanna-be-minister , is threatening to walk out .
and angela merkel must get worried again about her chancellorship .
if the coalition negotiations fail because of the comrades , new elections would be the most realistic consequence .
it 's slowly getting spooky in germany . " reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to say one 's good-byes ?
die welt from berlin saw müntefering 's departure as a clear signal of the degree to which spd is divided internally : " like a bolt from the allegedly blue sky , spd found out yesterday that the alliance with the union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- still called for a decision to be made on the party direction : it is the choice between moderate modernization and traditional utopia ; between the social democratic center of gerhard schröder and a possible parliamentary majority on the far left .
franz müntefering deftly covered up the issue after the elections .
in his own person , he wanted to take up the conflict of positions and solve it : as the spd president and vice-chancellor in the cabinet , along with close confidants in the parliamentary group and party headquarters .
with andrea nahles as the secretary general , the party leadership destroyed this hope , which was already bordering on self-illusion .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 non-traditional burials gain popularity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anonymous " peace forests " are becoming increasingly popular the church holiday of all saints is a day when loved ones remember deceased relatives and care for their graves .
more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .
joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.11.2005 austria 's right-winger haider on the decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider may have had his day in austrian politics call it a case of schadenfreude , but many in austria and elsewhere are applauding the political downward spiral of infamous right-wing leader jörg haider . successive election defeats appear to have seriously damaged the political career of jörg haider , the veteran radical-right leader , who has announced his retirement at the age of 56 and whose party is fast withering away . " haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .

with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .

the new identity document contains biometric data , which supporters say will protect against forgery , make identity checks and border controls easier and help police to track criminals .
but data protection campaigners remain worried about who can get their hands on the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passports ought to make border control easier outgoing german interior minister otto schily has been one of the main supporters of the new electronic passport .
for his efforts , privacy campaigners awarded him the big brother lifetime award - an ironic trophy inspired by george orwell 's famous anti-utopian novel " 1984 " - for , among other things , " the overhasty introduction of the electronic passport with poorly conceived technology and without parliamentary legitimacy . " schily 's confidence in electronic documents , however , has not been shaken . " i believe the security benefits for everyone are clear-cut , so i can ’ t understand why anyone would raise doubts , " schily said . according to schily , the new passports will help prevent forgery and fraud and make it easier to track criminals . " with modern methods of biometric identification , it ’ s obviously easier to find out whether a particular document is the one that was actually issued to a person and whether a person standing in front of you is who they say they are , " schily said . how will it all work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufhansa is testing tickets encoded with thumbprint data by the summer of 2006 , all new eu passports will contain a special chip which stores a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .
when someone presents that passport , a facial recognition system measures and records the distance between their features - mouth , eyes , nose , forehead and chin .
these features are unique for each person , so the data can be compared with what is stored in the passport to make sure people are who they say they are . one reason for the new eu passport rules is heightened security concerns after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
there was also pressure from the united states , which says that only holders of electronic passports will be eligible for visa-free travel to the us in future . under the new rules , eu countries must introduce biometric passports by oct .
2006 , although people only have to get one when they apply for a new passport . the more information , the better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the facial recognition technology claim it is not reliable enough from the very beginning , otto schily was in favor of recording more biometric details in the passport . " our trials have shown that when we include more biometric information in the passport-chips that achieves the best combination of speed and reliability of passport checks , " schily said . in the end , his eu colleagues decided that from jan .
2008 , at the latest , european passports must also include scans of two fingerprints .
they will be incorporated in german passports by early 2007 . but some data protection campaigners and computer specialists have voiced concerns .
they say that in facial recognition tests , biometric scanners have an error rate of 15 to 25 percent .
fingerprint scanners can be outsmarted by clever fakes made of latex . additional concerns have been raised that the countries that scan passport data can use the scanned information to build databases of photos and fingerprints that could then be used to illegally track travelers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look glum for the birdie not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces .

for his efforts , privacy campaigners awarded him the big brother lifetime award - an ironic trophy inspired by george orwell 's famous anti-utopian novel " 1984 " - for , among other things , " the overhasty introduction of the electronic passport with poorly conceived technology and without parliamentary legitimacy . " schily 's confidence in electronic documents , however , has not been shaken . " i believe the security benefits for everyone are clear-cut , so i can ’ t understand why anyone would raise doubts , " schily said . according to schily , the new passports will help prevent forgery and fraud and make it easier to track criminals . " with modern methods of biometric identification , it ’ s obviously easier to find out whether a particular document is the one that was actually issued to a person and whether a person standing in front of you is who they say they are , " schily said . how will it all work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufhansa is testing tickets encoded with thumbprint data by the summer of 2006 , all new eu passports will contain a special chip which stores a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .
when someone presents that passport , a facial recognition system measures and records the distance between their features - mouth , eyes , nose , forehead and chin .
these features are unique for each person , so the data can be compared with what is stored in the passport to make sure people are who they say they are . one reason for the new eu passport rules is heightened security concerns after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
there was also pressure from the united states , which says that only holders of electronic passports will be eligible for visa-free travel to the us in future . under the new rules , eu countries must introduce biometric passports by oct .
2006 , although people only have to get one when they apply for a new passport . the more information , the better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the facial recognition technology claim it is not reliable enough from the very beginning , otto schily was in favor of recording more biometric details in the passport . " our trials have shown that when we include more biometric information in the passport-chips that achieves the best combination of speed and reliability of passport checks , " schily said . in the end , his eu colleagues decided that from jan .
2008 , at the latest , european passports must also include scans of two fingerprints .
they will be incorporated in german passports by early 2007 . but some data protection campaigners and computer specialists have voiced concerns .
they say that in facial recognition tests , biometric scanners have an error rate of 15 to 25 percent .
fingerprint scanners can be outsmarted by clever fakes made of latex . additional concerns have been raised that the countries that scan passport data can use the scanned information to build databases of photos and fingerprints that could then be used to illegally track travelers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look glum for the birdie not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

deutsche telekom believes it 's turning one of berlin 's iconic landmarks into a big pink football . for international soccer players , the world cup is the highest point of their playing days .
whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .
the 32-meter square ball atop the tower may be just one of a number of globes getting the telekom treatment in the run up to the world cup . " the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .

" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences .

" i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .
under strache 's energetic leadership , the freedom party won 15 percent of the vote in vienna following a xenophobic campaign largely directed against the turkish minority . rival more " primitive " the magazine news described the 36-year-old strache as " the new haider , " but pelinka added that strache was " more primitive . "
strache , who is on the extreme right of his party , was elected to the leadership after haider 's defection , replacing ursula haubner , haider 's sister and minister of social affairs , who was among the party members who left to form the alliance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian voters are increasingly shunning haider the setbacks for his party led haider to announce that he would soon quit the central leadership of the party , leaving it in the hands of vice chancellor hubert gobach . it will not be the first time that haider has left politics in this way , but he has always managed to come back in a leadership capacity a month or so later . lack of focus analysts said the alliance appears to have become marginalized and the coalition government weakened as a result .
but they said legislative elections , scheduled to take place in a year 's time , were unlikely to be brought forward . pelinka said the alliance was lacking a focused image . " if the bzö wants to present itself as a conservative party , the people 's party is more credible , and if it wants to play on the extreme right register , the old fpö is better placed to do that because it is more violent , " pelinka said . haider 's former freedom party lost ground heavily in the states of styria and burgenland , but achieved what the magazine profil called a " phenomenal " result in vienna . pelinka , however , said the result was not as good as all that because " with the same slogans , it managed to win 20 percent of the vote in 2001 " and this share shrank by 5 percentage points in the october 23 election . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the latest incarnation of jörg haider once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 non-traditional burials gain popularity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anonymous " peace forests " are becoming increasingly popular the church holiday of all saints is a day when loved ones remember deceased relatives and care for their graves .
more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .

however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .

spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 opinion : germany 's election aftershock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided it 's time to go social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader franz müntefering was right to step down after losing the inner-party power struggle over the post of secretary general .
but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .
these are exciting times in berlin . jens thurau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müntefering to step down as spd leader franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday .

" franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .

" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership .

" the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved .

" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 press review : bizarre spectacle of german politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering seems ready to vanish from the spd 's leadership the german press reacted with bafflement to franz müntefering 's decision to step down as spd leader , since the untimely power struggle within spd could only destabilize the future government .
if one is formed , that is . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d from hamburg described müntefering 's stepping down as a " bizarre spectacle " with potentially serious consequences .
" in its strategic confusion , spd accidentally knocked over its party president , who was willing and supposed to lead the party into the grand coalition .
the fall of franz müntefering is the worst possible accident for spd , and it also batters the future coalition , before it even got to be formed properly .
the chancellor-to-be angela merkel is suddenly left without a vice-chancellor who could keep his party in line with the coalition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with müntefering gone , who will merkel rely on as her vice-chancellor ?
in a similar vein , the berlin daily taz described müntefering 's departure as a " misfortune for the spd , which has already been disheveled by schröder 's ego trips .
müntefering epitomizes better than anybody else the social-democratic virtues : reliability and unpretentiousness .
who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?
hardly .
the whole construction of the grand coalition may break down without müntefering .
that would be a victory of the irrational over the rational .
spd does n't seem to understand itself these days . " questio n i n g the sa n ity of it all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles : future spd secretary general ?
the popular german tabloid bild came out on tuesday morning with a picture of franz müntefering on its title page and the headline " are you politicians crazy ? "
stressing the fact that " politicians without power " would be participating in the coalition negotiations with the " helpless " angela merkel , bild commented on müntefering 's pulling out as a bad omen : " this is bad for spd , it 's bad for further coalition negotiations , and , therefore , bad for the country … franz müntefering was anything but an easy partner for cdu / csu .
but with the old-school ' leftie ' from north rhine-westphalia , one was reasonably certain that there could be no red-red-green -lrb- coalition between spd , former communist left party and the green party -rrb- .
since yesterday , no cdu politician would be willing to bet on it . " neue presse from hanover emphasized the self-destructive nature of the spd inner politics : " the result of this impressive demonstration of the social-democratic joy of losing is the total chaos in the now leaderless spd .
and , what 's even worse , in berlin .
the timidly sprouting hopes for a thriving government cooperation of the two big parties are again called into question .
the grand coalition is in crisis before it even started .
the would-be-vice-chancellor müntefering is at a breaking point .
stoiber , still a wanna-be-minister , is threatening to walk out .
and angela merkel must get worried again about her chancellorship .
if the coalition negotiations fail because of the comrades , new elections would be the most realistic consequence .
it 's slowly getting spooky in germany . " reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to say one 's good-byes ?
die welt from berlin saw müntefering 's departure as a clear signal of the degree to which spd is divided internally : " like a bolt from the allegedly blue sky , spd found out yesterday that the alliance with the union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- still called for a decision to be made on the party direction : it is the choice between moderate modernization and traditional utopia ; between the social democratic center of gerhard schröder and a possible parliamentary majority on the far left .
franz müntefering deftly covered up the issue after the elections .
in his own person , he wanted to take up the conflict of positions and solve it : as the spd president and vice-chancellor in the cabinet , along with close confidants in the parliamentary group and party headquarters .
with andrea nahles as the secretary general , the party leadership destroyed this hope , which was already bordering on self-illusion . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue her attempts to form a coalition government despite a bombshell decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .
-lrb- nov .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .
these are exciting times in berlin . jens thurau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müntefering to step down as spd leader franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 coalition government in doubt as spd undergoes shakeup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sudden crisis at the spd could tear apart the left-right coalition the surprise announcement of the resignation of spd chief franz müntefering has thrown the future of a left-right coalition government into doubt .
but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .

" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

deutsche telekom believes it 's turning one of berlin 's iconic landmarks into a big pink football . for international soccer players , the world cup is the highest point of their playing days .
whether they win or lose there , an appearance for their country at the global soccer spectacle is usually the pinnacle of their careers . so it is rather apt that with so many players arriving in germany next summer in pursuit of that lofty achievement , the host nation should go to great lengths - or to be more precise , heights - to shout from the highest point that this is the greatest soccer show on earth . and that is why deutsche telekom is going to stick a big soccer ball on top of berlin 's iconic television tower . the 368-meter -lrb- 1,207-foot -rrb- tall spire with the glittering bauble on the top is germany 's highest building and , with a good seven months to go before the world cup actually kicks off , the owners of the tower want to mark the event by turning the spherical section into a magenta ball . other la n dmarks targeted for telekom twist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no landmark will be safe if telekom 's campaign goes ahead and the promotion , once the plan is approved , is unlikely to stop there .
the 32-meter square ball atop the tower may be just one of a number of globes getting the telekom treatment in the run up to the world cup . " the television tower is not the only berlin landmark which will be used in the campaign for the world cup if the plan is approved , " deutsche telekom 's matthias schumann told bild tabloid . although nothing is confirmed , berliners must be cringing at the idea of a pink soccer ball replacing the glass dome on top of the bundestag or a magenta and white covering adorning the roof of the sony center in potsdamer platz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other .

" this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 opinion : germany 's election aftershock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided it 's time to go social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader franz müntefering was right to step down after losing the inner-party power struggle over the post of secretary general .
but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .
these are exciting times in berlin . jens thurau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müntefering to step down as spd leader franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday .
-lrb- oct .
31 , 2005 -rrb- spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general .
-lrb- oct .
31 , 2005 -rrb- a lost generation ?
spd struggles to find new blood german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 opinion : germany 's election aftershock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering decided it 's time to go social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader franz müntefering was right to step down after losing the inner-party power struggle over the post of secretary general .
but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .
these are exciting times in berlin . jens thurau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müntefering to step down as spd leader franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday .
-lrb- oct .
31 , 2005 -rrb- spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general .
-lrb- oct .
31 , 2005 -rrb- a lost generation ?
spd struggles to find new blood german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .

however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure .

but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a would-be terrorist : in the country when he legally should n't have been the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .
he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .

the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .
lawyers in the case are hoping for up to 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- in compensation . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the quest for gold left lives in ruins more than 160 athletes from the former east germany are demanding compensation for the effects of performance-enhancing drugs they were made to take , often as children .

who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?
hardly .
the whole construction of the grand coalition may break down without müntefering .
that would be a victory of the irrational over the rational .
spd does n't seem to understand itself these days . " questio n i n g the sa n ity of it all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles : future spd secretary general ?
the popular german tabloid bild came out on tuesday morning with a picture of franz müntefering on its title page and the headline " are you politicians crazy ? "
stressing the fact that " politicians without power " would be participating in the coalition negotiations with the " helpless " angela merkel , bild commented on müntefering 's pulling out as a bad omen : " this is bad for spd , it 's bad for further coalition negotiations , and , therefore , bad for the country … franz müntefering was anything but an easy partner for cdu / csu .
but with the old-school ' leftie ' from north rhine-westphalia , one was reasonably certain that there could be no red-red-green -lrb- coalition between spd , former communist left party and the green party -rrb- .
since yesterday , no cdu politician would be willing to bet on it . " neue presse from hanover emphasized the self-destructive nature of the spd inner politics : " the result of this impressive demonstration of the social-democratic joy of losing is the total chaos in the now leaderless spd .
and , what 's even worse , in berlin .
the timidly sprouting hopes for a thriving government cooperation of the two big parties are again called into question .
the grand coalition is in crisis before it even started .
the would-be-vice-chancellor müntefering is at a breaking point .
stoiber , still a wanna-be-minister , is threatening to walk out .
and angela merkel must get worried again about her chancellorship .
if the coalition negotiations fail because of the comrades , new elections would be the most realistic consequence .
it 's slowly getting spooky in germany . " reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to say one 's good-byes ?
die welt from berlin saw müntefering 's departure as a clear signal of the degree to which spd is divided internally : " like a bolt from the allegedly blue sky , spd found out yesterday that the alliance with the union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- still called for a decision to be made on the party direction : it is the choice between moderate modernization and traditional utopia ; between the social democratic center of gerhard schröder and a possible parliamentary majority on the far left .
franz müntefering deftly covered up the issue after the elections .
in his own person , he wanted to take up the conflict of positions and solve it : as the spd president and vice-chancellor in the cabinet , along with close confidants in the parliamentary group and party headquarters .
with andrea nahles as the secretary general , the party leadership destroyed this hope , which was already bordering on self-illusion .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court finds terror suspects guilty four men who have been linked to al qaeda , have been sentenced to jail terms of between five and eight years for planning attacks against jewish sites in germany .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

but his move leaves more questions open than it resolves . a pale franz müntefering announced on monday that he would not run for re-election as party chairman at the social democrats ' convention in mid-november in karlsruhe .
no questions , please .
he spoke and then disappeared . the powerful spd boss was on the wrong track with his answer to the question of who should succeed luckless secretary general klaus-uwe benneter .
müntefering wanted his buddy kajo wasserhövel to prevail at any price .
he brought wasserhövel 's name into play without consulting with the party 's bodies and rebuffed all criticism of his personnel suggestion .
and he failed terribly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kajo wasserhövel instead of wasserhövel , left-winger andrea nahles will run for secretary general in karlsruhe .
the spd 's top body made the decision with an overwhelming majority - despite the fact that chancellor schröder repeatedly spoke out in favor of wasserhövel and , thus , spoke out in favor of müntefering .
the board 's decision could have consequences that go far beyond the party . müntefering 's withdrawal is logical .
a party boss who does n't prevail when naming the second-most important position has lost all authority .
the party chairman miscalculated the atmosphere in the spd 's top bodies and among the rank-and-file .
he unnecessarily forced a test of endurance on his party .
with all his power , he wanted to assert his favorite and trusted that the spd would n't leave its boss and top coalition negotiator out in the rain .
spd tor n but wasserhövel would have been the future vice chancellor and minister 's secretary .
his job would have been to keep the spd firmly in line with the government 's course .
müntefering did n't notice how fiercely the spd has been fighting with having such a role .
simply filling a personnel position became an open critique of the spd taking the route of a grand coalition with the conservatives , which müntefering supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles -lrb- in foreground -rrb- all 45 members of the party board knew exactly what the price would be .
nominating nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- meant completely removing müntefering .
müntefering , the spd 's central figure in the current coalition talks , explicitly left open whether he would still be part of the cabinet .
and that 's why there are now more questions than there are answers . can christian democratic union boss angela merkel keep together the complicated alliance with the social democrats without müntefering ?
does the spd - for which internally setting the course is more important than successful negotiations about a governing coalition - even want this alliance ?
what route will the spd take now that it 's chosen a declared leftist as secretary general ?
what will the spd do without müntefering , the great integration figure of recent years ? now the voices are reverberating that warned against talking about the grand coalition as a foregone conclusion .
what a dramatic defeat for the man who just days ago pundits said had more power than any spd boss in recent decades .
these are exciting times in berlin . jens thurau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de müntefering to step down as spd leader franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .

" haider 's star has definitely waned , " said political analyst anton pelinka .
" he has had his day , and he can not pull things off any more , at least outside his fiefdom in carinthia , " the southern province where he is governor . according to the daily die presse , " jörg haider can no longer halt the defeat of his party , which he himself touched off by dividing " the extreme right in april . was once savior of extreme right haider defected from his freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- april 4 to form a new alliance for austria 's future -lrb- bzö -rrb- , which promised to support the ruling coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor and leader of the people 's party wolfgang schüssel entered into alliance with haider for a long time , the charismatic haider was the savior of the extreme right when it was in difficulty , but today " it is doubtful that anyone would still call on him for help , " die presse added . haider , then a young populist who played on xenophobic and anti-eu fears and stirred up nostalgia for certain aspects of the country 's nazi past , took over the freedom party in 1986 and went from success to success . losing the votes the fpö had 5 percent of the vote when haider assumed the leadership and went on to grab 27 percent in the 1999 legislative elections , swelling into austria 's second biggest party . but since the extreme right entered government in 2000 in coalition with the mainstream conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , it has steadily lost popularity and votes in subsequent elections . three government ministers and three secretaries of state belong to haider 's current alliance .
but on october 23 , the alliance obtained only 1.7 percent of the popular vote in haider 's carinthia stronghold and a mere 1.1 percent in vienna . on top of this , haider has been forced to watch the relative success in vienna of his former protegé , now his bitter rival , heinz-christian strache .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on nov .
14-16 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles müntefering , 65 , decided to stand down as party leader after the unofficial leader of the spd 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next general secretary , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate . " i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters . müntefering , who was viewed as key to holding together a potentially fractious coalition , put on a brave face late monday after leading the spd through a fourth round of talks with merkel 's christian democrat -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- alliance . " our intention of forming a grand coalition remains unchanged , " he told reporters , but conceded : " we face a complicated situation . " he said he would steer the spd through the remainder of the negotiations and hoped the task would be completed before the spd 's congress , but refused to say how he saw his future beyond that date . merkel stressed her determination to carry on building the coalition despite the news . " we intend to reach an agreement , " she said after the talks . stoiber will stay in munich müntefering 's shock announcements caused ripples on the other side of the negotiation table .
according to zdf television , merkel 's key ally and economy minister-designate , edmund stoiber , will likely not take a post in merkel 's cabinet . " it 's looking like that at the moment , " a source in his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said .
" but things could still change there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : media reports say stoiber is bidding farewell to berlin stoiber , the premier of bavaria , had already hinted that he might not come to berlin just after müntefering 's surprise announcement . " we are now dealing with a changed political climate , " stoiber had previously told reporters .
" franz müntefering was a cornerstone of the coalition and this cornerstone has changed . " the csu will hold a telephone conference on tuesday afternoon where it is expected that his successor in a grand coalition government will be named .
a leading candidate is michael glos , parliamentary leader of the csu . schröder urges grand coalition outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder of the social democrats appealed for calm and said müntefering 's decision should not be allowed to derail the negotiations , due to wrap up on nov .
12 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has already said he wo n't serve in the next government " germany needs a stable government , and in the current situation , only a grand coalition is possible , " he said . the spd leader said a new candidate for the post of party chief would be nominated by wednesday , but the political damage can not be undone , said senior spd member ludwig stiegler : " we 're talking about a party-political accident , " he said .
" and this accident happened , because some reached their decision in monday 's vote , not thinking about the possible grave consequences . " jamaica back on the table ? others tried to play down the incident and said they hoped müntefering would join the next government . " i trust that we 'll all display the calm and sobriety required to deal with the new situation and continue on the path embarked upon together with the bloc of conservatives as our potential coalition partners , " said jochen dieckmann , the spd leader of north rhine-westphalia . but gerd langguth , a political analyst from bonn university , countered that a weakened franz müntefering puts coalition talks in great danger of ending in failure . " the spd will have to show even more resolve now to prove that it can conduct coalition talks on an equal footing , " he said .
" the party can not afford to dismantle müntefering even more by questioning his support for some highly unpopular measures which any new government will have to announce .
all the more so since the spd knows that there 's no real alternative to bringing coalition talks to a successful end .
otherwise , it may end up in opposition with a three-way coalition of conservatives , free democrats and the greens not completely off the table yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is toying with the idea of joining the government after all guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market , liberal free democrats , already said he was willing to restart discussions about a so-called jamaica coalition of cdu / csu , greens and his party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 coalition government in doubt as spd undergoes shakeup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sudden crisis at the spd could tear apart the left-right coalition the surprise announcement of the resignation of spd chief franz müntefering has thrown the future of a left-right coalition government into doubt .
but what an alternative would be is unclear . müntefering 's decision to step down from the leadership post at the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- combined with the news that edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian christian social union , had abandoned plans to join a future cabinet has politicians on both sides questioning whether a " grand coalition " between the conservatives and the social democrats is now possible . " the whole project of cooperating to form a government is under examination , " gernot erler , the deputy head of the spd in parliament , said in a television interview . questions about the feasibility of a coalition government between the center left and center right are also coming from the conservatives , especially after the sense of crisis was ratcheted up a notch after stoiber , a powerful german politician and key player in the coalition formation talks , said on tuesday evening he would not take up a post in the future angela merkel-led cabinet . " franz müntefering is an authority and pillar of the grand coalition , " he said .
" this has changed with developments in the spd .
the course of the spd is no longer so clear . " he went on to say he thought he could better represent the interests of his csu party from munich .
he suggested that michael glos , the csu 's parliamentary leader , replace him . this double defection unnerved politicians on the conservative side as well . " we want to bring these -lrb- coalition -rrb- negotiations to a successful conclusion , but one ca n't rule out -lrb- the possibility -rrb- that they will fail , " said wolfgang bosbach , the deputy conservative leader in parliament and close ally of merkel , in a radio interview .
merkel herself tried to allay fears tuesday evening .
" i am fully committed to making a grand coalition possible .
we will work to make a success of it , " she said on national television .
" we will work towards this goal with optimism , with effort and with some joy at the prospect of giving the electorate that for which it voted . " resignation to seal coalition fate ? müntefering was slated to become labor minister and vice-chancellor in the coalition government , and earlier tuesday it was unclear whether he would take up those posts in a future cabinet after his resignation from the top spd position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's sudden announcement has thrown his party into an uproar while several politicians expressed doubts about the future government constellation , some political analysts also think a müntefering exit could prove fatal for a left-right partnership . " there will be grave consequences for the coalition if müntefering really does opt out of the cabinet , " said luthar probst from the political institute in bremen . minister after all ? but later on tuesday in a memo addressed to spd members that will likely soothe some fears of a grand coalition collapse , müntefering indicated he would be willing to still serve as labor minister and vice-chancellor in a merkel cabinet . " the spd leadership will get younger just a little earlier than i thought it would , " the memo said , adding that he wanted to work on a friendly basis from inside the government with the future leadership of the social democrats . müntefering had announced his resignation from the party leadership post on monday after his hand-picked candidate for the position of spd secretary general , kajo wasserhövel , lost soundly in an executive committee vote to andrea nahles , who represents the left-wing of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel with franz müntefering gero neugebauer , a professor of political sociology at berlin 's free university , does not believe the current uproar over the spd leadership and stoiber 's return to munich necessarily means the end of the grand coalition , despite the shaken confidence of the parties involved . " both parties have a long-term interest in making it work for now , " he said .
" both need to build a stable government and look toward to the 2009 elections . " but he added : " the chances of that coalition being stable are now not as good . " generational change the strains within the spd were evident on tuesday with calls going out for a wholesale shake-up of the party leadership while others are calling for all personnel questions to be put off for two weeks , until an spd party congress is scheduled takes place . an internet site called " we want franz " has been set up to support keeping müntefering on board .
he is considered by many to be a level-headed broker , whose has demonstrated talent in holding his often fractious party together and negotiating successfully with conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles some see the rejection of müntefering 's candidate for secretary general by the executive committee in favor of the 35-year-old nahles a sign of a leftward shift in the party and an early indication that a battle is brewing between the spd 's more centrist wing , represented by müntefering , and the left-wing group , whose members tend to be younger .
nahles herself was once head of the jusos , the party 's youth wing . but neugebauer said he thinks there is more of a generational conflict in play , and a rebellion against an authoritarian leadership style münterfering represented , in which decisions were often made by a few from on high . " the struggle is between the technocrats of the party , such as wasserhövel represented , and those who want their leaders to listen to what party members and voters have to say , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stays focused on grand coalition despite spd fiasco german chancellor-designate angela merkel has said that she will continue to try to form a coalition government despite a decision by her negotiating counterpart franz müntefering to quit as spd leader .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court finds terror suspects guilty four men who have been linked to al qaeda , have been sentenced to jail terms of between five and eight years for planning attacks against jewish sites in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 press review : bizarre spectacle of german politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering seems ready to vanish from the spd 's leadership the german press reacted with bafflement to franz müntefering 's decision to step down as spd leader , since the untimely power struggle within spd could only destabilize the future government .
if one is formed , that is . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d from hamburg described müntefering 's stepping down as a " bizarre spectacle " with potentially serious consequences .
" in its strategic confusion , spd accidentally knocked over its party president , who was willing and supposed to lead the party into the grand coalition .
the fall of franz müntefering is the worst possible accident for spd , and it also batters the future coalition , before it even got to be formed properly .
the chancellor-to-be angela merkel is suddenly left without a vice-chancellor who could keep his party in line with the coalition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with müntefering gone , who will merkel rely on as her vice-chancellor ?
in a similar vein , the berlin daily taz described müntefering 's departure as a " misfortune for the spd , which has already been disheveled by schröder 's ego trips .
müntefering epitomizes better than anybody else the social-democratic virtues : reliability and unpretentiousness .
who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?
hardly .
the whole construction of the grand coalition may break down without müntefering .
that would be a victory of the irrational over the rational .
spd does n't seem to understand itself these days . " questio n i n g the sa n ity of it all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles : future spd secretary general ?

if one is formed , that is . the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d from hamburg described müntefering 's stepping down as a " bizarre spectacle " with potentially serious consequences .
" in its strategic confusion , spd accidentally knocked over its party president , who was willing and supposed to lead the party into the grand coalition .
the fall of franz müntefering is the worst possible accident for spd , and it also batters the future coalition , before it even got to be formed properly .
the chancellor-to-be angela merkel is suddenly left without a vice-chancellor who could keep his party in line with the coalition . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with müntefering gone , who will merkel rely on as her vice-chancellor ?
in a similar vein , the berlin daily taz described müntefering 's departure as a " misfortune for the spd , which has already been disheveled by schröder 's ego trips .
müntefering epitomizes better than anybody else the social-democratic virtues : reliability and unpretentiousness .
who should now present the painful cost-cutting policy to spd in a trustworthy manner - a technocrat like -lrb- finance minister-designate -rrb- peer steinbrück ?
hardly .
the whole construction of the grand coalition may break down without müntefering .
that would be a victory of the irrational over the rational .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 germany introduces biometric passports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily showing off a biometric passport - clearly not his own despite privacy concerns , the proponents of biometric documents greeted the introduction of electronic passports in germany on tuesday as an important milestone in the fight against terrorism . germany introduced electronic passports on tuesday as one of the first countries in the european union .
the new identity document contains biometric data , which supporters say will protect against forgery , make identity checks and border controls easier and help police to track criminals .
but data protection campaigners remain worried about who can get their hands on the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passports ought to make border control easier outgoing german interior minister otto schily has been one of the main supporters of the new electronic passport .
for his efforts , privacy campaigners awarded him the big brother lifetime award - an ironic trophy inspired by george orwell 's famous anti-utopian novel " 1984 " - for , among other things , " the overhasty introduction of the electronic passport with poorly conceived technology and without parliamentary legitimacy . " schily 's confidence in electronic documents , however , has not been shaken . " i believe the security benefits for everyone are clear-cut , so i can ’ t understand why anyone would raise doubts , " schily said . according to schily , the new passports will help prevent forgery and fraud and make it easier to track criminals . " with modern methods of biometric identification , it ’ s obviously easier to find out whether a particular document is the one that was actually issued to a person and whether a person standing in front of you is who they say they are , " schily said . how will it all work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufhansa is testing tickets encoded with thumbprint data by the summer of 2006 , all new eu passports will contain a special chip which stores a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germany -pipe- 01.11.2005 non-traditional burials gain popularity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anonymous " peace forests " are becoming increasingly popular the church holiday of all saints is a day when loved ones remember deceased relatives and care for their graves .
more and more however , typical gravesites marked by a headstone are declining in popularity . if one were to ask a german what burial method they would choose for their last remains , most - about 60 percent - would choose traditional methods such as cremation with an urn as their final resting place . " i think it 's best to be cremated , because it 's easier , " one woman recently told german public broadcaster wdr .
" there are n't any complications and such for the family . " and then there is the traditional burial , in a casket , that another german man would prefer . " when the time comes i 'll be buried in the normal way , " he said . " of course there is more cost , but the way i feel about it i 'll be dead anyway and personally i would n't want to be cremated . " rise i n popularity of alter n ative burials of the approximately 820,000 who die annually in germany , about 15 percent opt to be buried anonymously , without ceremony . likewise , more and more germans are also opting for non-traditional options such as burial at sea , communal graves or burial in woodland cemeteries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cremation remains one of the most popular alternatives " i think it 's good , first of all because it 's cheaper , " said another man in a report on german television . " especially when i think of the way my parents were buried with all that pomp , the huge headstone and so forth .
i just do n't think all of that is necessary . " as an alternative to traditional cemetaries , one can choose a final resting place in a forest with a tree as a marker for around 800 euros -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- . there are currently eight so-called " woodland cemeteries " in germany , a relatively new development and one which the church frowns upon . but for many people , the high burial costs are the deciding factor , said berlin psychologist silke haase .
for coffin , cemetery and funeral taxes , one can expect to pay well over 1,000 euros .
similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .
1 and nov .
2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .
many in the clergy see this trend as yet another form of isolation for a rapidly aging population that often spends their final days of life , and death , in reclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church says it 's healthy for loved ones to be able to visit a place of remembrance therefore , the church has sought to re-emphasize the significance of traditional entombment ceremonies as well as permanent graves , claiming that the dead should be remembered as distinctive individuals . likewise , they also maintain that for many people permanent memorials and gravestones hold a certain ' holy ' significance .
according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services . " there are many funeral parlors that have already adapted , where one can choose individual music for the funeral service or even paint the caskets themselves , " haase said . the church remains critical of such changes in burial culture .
joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .
" now it 's also those of us who are left behind who need a ritual .

similarly , changes in family structure have played a big part in the process of saying goodbye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-traditional burials are often much cheaper and viewed as less wasteful " i think another reason is that many people do n't think that it 's so important anymore , " haase said .
" they do n't need to have a grave that they can visit daily to make peace with the deceased .
they are trying to find other ways to connect with their departed relatives . " according to a recent opinion poll questioning germans about their entombment wishes , 40 percent favored an anonymous burial , a tree burial or cremation followed by burial in a garden or at sea . church voices co n cer n on the occasion of the religious holidays " all saints " and " all souls , " on nov .

2 , the catholic and protestant churches in germany have publicly criticized the growth of such anonymous graves .

according to a recently published statement by the protestant church , many of those who have agreed to bury their loved-ones anonymously often suffer the consequences of not having a specific place of mourning . fu n eral i n dustry adopts to cha n ge i n prefere n ces on the practical side , those who are involved with the business side of dying - the casket industry , funeral parlors and local communities - are reacting to such changes in pragmatic fashion by offering a new variety of products and services .

joachim wanke , bishop of erfurt , who is himself responsible for questions of congregational policies , put forth this reservation at the german bishops ' conference . " it used to be that dead were at the center of funeral ceremonies , " he said .

the new identity document contains biometric data , which supporters say will protect against forgery , make identity checks and border controls easier and help police to track criminals .
but data protection campaigners remain worried about who can get their hands on the information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passports ought to make border control easier outgoing german interior minister otto schily has been one of the main supporters of the new electronic passport .
for his efforts , privacy campaigners awarded him the big brother lifetime award - an ironic trophy inspired by george orwell 's famous anti-utopian novel " 1984 " - for , among other things , " the overhasty introduction of the electronic passport with poorly conceived technology and without parliamentary legitimacy . " schily 's confidence in electronic documents , however , has not been shaken . " i believe the security benefits for everyone are clear-cut , so i can ’ t understand why anyone would raise doubts , " schily said . according to schily , the new passports will help prevent forgery and fraud and make it easier to track criminals . " with modern methods of biometric identification , it ’ s obviously easier to find out whether a particular document is the one that was actually issued to a person and whether a person standing in front of you is who they say they are , " schily said . how will it all work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufhansa is testing tickets encoded with thumbprint data by the summer of 2006 , all new eu passports will contain a special chip which stores a digital photo of the passport holder 's face .
when someone presents that passport , a facial recognition system measures and records the distance between their features - mouth , eyes , nose , forehead and chin .
these features are unique for each person , so the data can be compared with what is stored in the passport to make sure people are who they say they are . one reason for the new eu passport rules is heightened security concerns after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
there was also pressure from the united states , which says that only holders of electronic passports will be eligible for visa-free travel to the us in future . under the new rules , eu countries must introduce biometric passports by oct .
2006 , although people only have to get one when they apply for a new passport . the more information , the better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the facial recognition technology claim it is not reliable enough from the very beginning , otto schily was in favor of recording more biometric details in the passport . " our trials have shown that when we include more biometric information in the passport-chips that achieves the best combination of speed and reliability of passport checks , " schily said . in the end , his eu colleagues decided that from jan .
2008 , at the latest , european passports must also include scans of two fingerprints .
they will be incorporated in german passports by early 2007 . but some data protection campaigners and computer specialists have voiced concerns .
they say that in facial recognition tests , biometric scanners have an error rate of 15 to 25 percent .
fingerprint scanners can be outsmarted by clever fakes made of latex . additional concerns have been raised that the countries that scan passport data can use the scanned information to build databases of photos and fingerprints that could then be used to illegally track travelers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look glum for the birdie not exactly known for being cheerful , a new regulation ordering germans not to smile on biometric passports could spell even longer faces .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .
lawyers in the case are hoping for up to 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.4 million -rrb- in compensation . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the quest for gold left lives in ruins more than 160 athletes from the former east germany are demanding compensation for the effects of performance-enhancing drugs they were made to take , often as children .

she says the steroids have caused lasting damage and is suing the german olympic committee . the court in berlin began on tuesday hearing witnesses in the case of the former european swimming champion who claims the performance-enhancing drugs she was given while a child in training have led to weight gain , clinical depression and could lead to future liver damage . könig , who won the european championships in 1984 , says from the age of 11 she was given pills by her trainers , who told her they were vitamins which would help her recover from demanding training sessions . while she is asking for just over 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,040 -rrb- from the german olympic committee -lrb- nok -rrb- , her case is being watched closely .
if she wins , it could lead to at least 137 other former athletes to press for claims and cost the cash-strapped olympic organization to pay damages in the range of 1.5 million euros . east german secret police files show that nok representatives were involved in the doping program and the former head of the committee was convicted in connection with doping five years ago . könig originally brought the complaint forward two years ago , but a frankfurt court postponed the case , saying it needed to hear more evidence . extensive doping program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger was once a woman and was fed male sex hormones as a performance booster east germany engaged widespread doping in the 1970s and 1980s to bring home as much gold as possible from the olympic games .
winning medals was seen more than just proof of superior sporting ability , it was considered an indication of a superior political system . one of tuesday 's witness was dorit rösler , a doctor who in the 1980s worked with the könig 's tsc berlin swimming association , took the stand , saying that for five years she participated in giving athletes anabolic steroids .
however , she could not confirm that könig showed any negative effects from the drugs during that period . günter paul , a press representative for the nok told reporters that the testimony , which was not made public , did not prove that könig 's heath problems were directly associated with the doping . the nok argues that other sports associations were more involved with the doping program that it was .
it also claims the current organization , which is based on the former west german association , should not be held liable for the actions of the east german group . in a related case , a court in hamburg this month is due to start hearing the case of 190 former east german athletes , who are suing the pharmaceutical company jenapharm .
now owned by schering , jenapharm manufactured the oral-turinabol steroid that many young athletes were given in the gdr era .

he says it has been lax in implementing immigration law .
others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources . according to ottmar breidling , the judge who presided over the case of four would-be terrorists who were convicted in a düsseldorf court of plotting attacks on jewish targets in germany , the case would not have even come to court had the country 's immigration authorities done their jobs . in a scathing dressing down of the immigration office , the judge faulted authorities for not sufficiently investigating the suspects , two jordanians , a palestinian and an algerian , before granting them temporary residency status . " this trial would not have been required if laws concerning foreigners had been implemented properly , " breidling said , adding that several of the accused had been convicted for drug trafficking and should have been deported .
instead , they were given temporary residency and even welfare benefits after they forged identity papers .
it was then that they begin building their terror cell . he said had the men been forced to leave germany , the state would have been spared both an expensive , 20-month trial and a serious terror threat . it also emerged that four witnesses in the trial were illegal immigrants who received german citizenship by using false passports . who 's responsible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants waiting in front of the hamburg immigration office the interior ministry of the state of north rhine-westphalia , where düsseldorf is located , said it was responding to the criticism and reviewing which offices were in charge of providing the permits to the men . but in what is illustrative of the byzantine and often conflicting areas of responsibility in germany 's complicated system of immigration agencies , offices tend to assign blame to each other . " our first task is to look into the circumstances , " said dagmar pelzer , a spokeswoman for the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry , which is responsible for the immigration office in that state .
" but from what we know up to now , the criticism of our office is not justified . " she added that crucial decisions " were made by the federal immigration authority .
we can ’ t do anything about that . "
but the federal office , in turn , threw the responsibility back to those at the state level . " our understanding is that the state offices are the focus of the critique , since we have nothing to do with deportation issues , " said claudia möbus , a spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees . limitations but the fact that the four convicted men slipped through germany 's immigration system , despite convictions and fraud , is not that surprising , according to peter knösel , a professor who studies immigration at the potsdam university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african asylum seekers in hamburg he says germany 's immigration officers generally do a fairly good job with the resources they have at hand , despite the criticism often expressed by both officials and immigrant support groups . he says they are working under extreme pressure , including understaffing , outdated technical systems , inadequate training and a gargantuan bureaucracy that , by its very nature , allows some people to slip under the radar . " how is your average civil servant working in an immigration office supposed to see through the false passport and identity papers from , say , chechnya ? " he asked .
" to really check out these stories on the ground is almost impossible . " he cited the example of berlin , which has about 250 people in its immigration office responsible for about 480,000 foreigners . " it 's a question of effectiveness and choosing which cases to double check , " he said .
sometimes , he added , the right cases are not chosen . he said germany has made strides when it comes to tracing terror suspects , since outgoing interior minister otto schily put the terrorism fight on the top of the agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood , home to many immigrants but if germany wants to become more effective , it still needs to look at drastically improving communication , increasing funding , establishing working relationships between immigration and law-enforcement offices , and restructuring the relationships between federal and state authorities . that could be in the cards , since federal reform in several areas is near the top of the agenda for the incoming grand coalition , which is currently engaged in talks to form the next government . anti-immigrant feeling some immigration and refugee groups fear that this latest news of a terror group whose members were in germany illegally - and even living off the state in some cases - could result in more ill will among the populace toward immigrants . " we 're not saying these cases are harmless , but to conclude from them that all asylum seekers or temporary residents are suspect is wrong , " said marei pelzer of pro-asyl .
" that 's the danger that we 're warning about . " # b # she said she hopes the judge 's critique does not result in politicians playing the populist card and implementing laws that would make it tougher for immigrants or asylum seekers to stay in the county . " it ca n't get any tougher than it already is , " she added .
" ever since the new anti-terror laws and the new immigration law -lrb- went into effect -rrb- , there is a new control and supervisory apparatus in existence unlike we 've ever seen before .

twelve people were reportedly arrested during clashes on monday with youths in clichy-sous-bois , although it was calmer than on previous nights .
the unrest was sparked by the death of two boys whom locals think were fleeing police , despite official denials .
mr sarkozy met police in clichy , but the boys ' parents refused to meet him .
on saturday , hundreds of mourners paid homage to the teenagers by holding a peaceful procession in the north-eastern suburb , which has a large immigrant population .
tough response the authorities have denied rumours that policemen were chasing the two boys , who were electrocuted on thursday after entering an electricity sub-station .
mourners paid tribute to the dead teenagers in a peaceful march flowers now lie near the spot where ziad , aged 17 , and banou , 15 , died .
an official investigation into the boys ' deaths is under way .
a third young man is seriously ill in hospital .
the bbc 's alasdair sandford in paris says many in the suburb do not believe the authorities ' account that the two boys were not being chased by police .
mr sarkozy has promised to send special police units into difficult suburbs around france to stamp out violence .
residents will be given " the security they have a right to " , he said while speaking to senior police officers in clichy .
he promised to find out who had hurled one or more tear gas canisters into a mosque on sunday night , but added " that does not mean that it was fired by a police officer " .
rumours that the tear gas was thrown by the police into a place of worship fuelled the unrest .
mr sarkozy also met the president of the muslim community in the clichy area .

the company said it will move to purpose-built offices in the city 's £ 200m sa1 waterfront business area to accommodate its staff .
admiral , founded in 1993 , employs 650 people in the city and 1,500 across south wales .
the firm is known mainly for car insurance .
the company 's move was helped by a £ 1.9m welsh assembly government grant .
admiral is set to become the largest employer in sa1 - a development which the welsh development agency hopes will spur the regeneration of wales ' second city .
the firm will move into the 40,000 sq ft cyprium building in march 2006 .
an additional 28,000 sq ft of the building will be completed by september , a spokesperson said .
welsh economic development minister , andrew davies , described the insurance group as " one of the great welsh success stories of the past decade " .
he said : " the decision to locate in sa1 will also act as a catalyst in attracting other businesses and service providers to the city . "
a spokeswoman for the assembly government said the grant was provided through the regional selective assistance scheme .
admiral 's swansea general manager , sian lewis said : " we 're very proud to be based in wales , and it 's great that we do n't have to look outside for offices in such excellent surroundings .
" the local labour market has produced an abundance of talent in the past , and the new offices allow us to draw on it once more , and reinforce our position as a company dedicated to the welsh economy . "

it has two bedrooms , a lounge , a dining room , a kitchen and a bathroom , and it is just 9ft by 9ft by 9ft .
the mini-home is already being looked at by a number of local authorities in britain as way of dealing with short term shortages in accommodation .
it could also be a self-contained home for elderly relatives or teenagers and can be sited in a garden .
inside the cube , the entrance lobby also doubles as a shower and a toilet .
a double bed folds down over the lounge area which within seconds can be turned into a dining room that can seat four people or even a spare bedroom .
the seats are also storage cupboards and can be cleared away to create a space in which three or four people can dance to the inbuilt surround sound system .

the pods can be stacked on one another or laid out in small colonies .
the architects behind the scheme say they are perhaps too small to live in permanently but can offer everything someone would need for a few months before they find a permanent home .
the buildings can be carried on the back of a truck and it is hoped they will provide local authorities with a way of using plots of land that are vacant for a few years , especially those awaiting development .

a t-shirt depicting the revolution 's figurehead , viktor yushchenko - now the country 's president - has stopped selling and will not be re-ordered , says saleswoman viktoria kucherenko .
but a t-shirt of the revolution 's leading lady , yulia tymoshenko - recently sacked as prime minister by mr yushchenko - is selling briskly .
to be fair , the yushchenko shirt is an older product and the tymoshenko shirt is more popular partly because it is newer and more topical .
but the way the two of them are going head-to-head in the shirt market mirrors the personal rivalry that has now come out into the open and which could be ukraine 's big political story for years to come .
the tymoshenko shirt carries a quotation from the first television interview she gave after her dismissal : " i 'm not going to hide myself away - i 'm not going anywhere . "
secret pact she aims to get her job back by winning the parliamentary elections in march .
the tymoshenko shirt -lrb- left -rrb- is the biggest seller the result would be an uncomfortable " co-habitation " , of the kind that sometimes occurs in france , between a president and a prime minister who do not see eye-to-eye .
however , in this case the differences would be on a personal more than political level .
rank and file supporters of the revolution were dismayed when the ex-comrades-in-arms fell out in early september and the government was dismissed .
mr yushchenko 's illness in 2004 meant that ms tymoshenko had taken on the full burden of the election campaign , criss-crossing the country to promote his candidacy .
it was her fiery oratory that helped draw the crowds back to the demonstration on kiev 's independence square again and again in the freezing winter temperatures .

but according to one of the country 's best-connected journalists , yulia mostova , editor of dzerkalo tizhnya -lrb- mirror of the week -rrb- , the couple never liked each other and only joined forces for the election because they knew that otherwise both would lose .
in september 2004 , ms mostova says , they signed a coalition pact , which had a secret protocol promising ms tymoshenko the premiership in case of victory .
but when they won the election , she says , mr yushchenko tried to persuade ms tymoshenko to release him from this promise .
" she said : ' if you do n't want to fulfil your obligations , do n't .
but i wo n't give in . '
-lsb- as prime minister -rsb- she expected to be sacked every day , because she understood the reality of their relationship - hatred , " says ms mostova .
aiming high there is speculation that the pair could put aside their differences again to form another bloc , either before or after the parliamentary election .
but ms tymoshenko 's campaign manager , oleksandr turchynov , until recently head of the ukrainian security service , says there is no chance of this unless the authorities prosecute businessmen and officials he has accused of corruption , including close allies of mr yushchenko .
people in kiev assess progress since the orange revolution in pictures as he puts it : " they must return to promises we made together on the maidan -lsb- independence square -rsb- , to throw out people suspected of corruption and to halt the influence of oligarchs on politics . "
ms mostova 's worry is that the rival orange factions will " drive each other into the grave , leaving their former enemy without opponents " .
mr yushchenko 's and ms tymoshenko 's natural supporters could be so disheartened that a large proportion of them will not vote , she suggests , while other voters go to the polls in force to ensure a parliamentary victory for the losing presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
whatever happens in march , there is every prospect that mr yushchenko and ms tymoshenko will have their sights on the 2009 presidential election from then on , and it seems unlikely that ms tymoshenko will want to work for her rival a second time .

in september 2004 , ms mostova says , they signed a coalition pact , which had a secret protocol promising ms tymoshenko the premiership in case of victory .
but when they won the election , she says , mr yushchenko tried to persuade ms tymoshenko to release him from this promise .

ms mostova 's worry is that the rival orange factions will " drive each other into the grave , leaving their former enemy without opponents " .
mr yushchenko 's and ms tymoshenko 's natural supporters could be so disheartened that a large proportion of them will not vote , she suggests , while other voters go to the polls in force to ensure a parliamentary victory for the losing presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
whatever happens in march , there is every prospect that mr yushchenko and ms tymoshenko will have their sights on the 2009 presidential election from then on , and it seems unlikely that ms tymoshenko will want to work for her rival a second time .
