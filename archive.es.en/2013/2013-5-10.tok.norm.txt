hallelujah : mark sanford and the abolition of gop “ family values ” trojan horse peter defazio fights to save one of the modern wonders of the world would you ever pay someone to fix your roof and then never check and make sure that he actually did the job you hired him to do ?
of course not .
but what if you weren 't given a chance to ?
it is good to see some information coming out about a handful of tax subsidy programs , but since all but one of the reports have incomplete information , it remains difficult for the public to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs .
mark sanford ran for office because he could – he knew the republican party needed a republican member of congress , and he knew that in the end – republican voters would choose a man that put his own interests ahead of the state ( and his family ) and lied about it – over a professional , respected woman of good character that had the audacity to be a democrat … in the shadow of these events it is easy , too easy , to throw up our hands and walk away in disgust and disdain . the siren ’ s call of surrender is seductive ; " moving on " to other more " pressing " issues can be justified as both necessary and unavoidable – given the demonstrable power of the nra to dispatch all threats - imaginary or not - to their conceptions of liberty through gun ownership .
for all practical purposes , the so-called “ gun debate ” appears to be over – at least for now .
we the people are citizens of a federal system of governance : the us government and the “ several states ” share responsibilities for safety and security - the so-called " police powers " were originally the exclusive domain of the states . and the creativity , innovation , and relationships in play at the state level , may yield both a direction as well as the motivation for national progress .
first , we must reorient the debate : what we seek is not “ gun control ” – control of guns . we seek “ gun violence control ” – and the difference between these two phrases matters .

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

sicherheitsschuhe sind stiefel oder halbschuhe , welche zum schutz getragen werden .
sie werden oft auch von beispielsweise berufsgenossenschaften vorgeschrieben .
zum einsatz kommen sicherheitsschuhe vor allem im bauwesen , in der industrie , im garten- und landschaftsbau , im rettungsdienst , bei der feuerwehr oder dem technischen hilfswerk .
sicherheitsschuhe haben am vorderen teil eine schutzkappe aus kunststoff oder metall , welche für den schutz der zehen vorgesehen ist .
das obermaterial ist meist aus leder und die sohle aus pu , gummi oder thermoplastischen elastomeren .
die chronische hyperglykämie bezeichnet man als diabetes mellitus , im volksmund auch als zuckerkrankheit bekannt .
es werden verschiedene formen der krankheit unterschieden , je nach der ursache der entstehung .

im mittelalter trug die bauersfrau im wesentlichen lange einfach genähte kleider aus selbst gewebtem leinen stoff .
manchmal färbte man ihn mit naturfarben ein , die man aus blaubeeren , spinat roten rüben , walnuss schalen oder safran gewann .
unterwäsche trug man kaum außer in sehr kalten monaten ein hemd aus wolle oder leinen .
im sommer ging frau barfuß , im winter trug sie meist bund schuhe aus selbst gegerbtem leder , umwickelt mit hanfseil oder holz pantinen mit socken aus selbst geschorener , selbst gesponnener und selbst gestrickter schafwolle .
der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .
auch samt aus china wurde herangeschafft und zu schönen , langen bestickten und mit perlen genähten kleidern verarbeitet .
dazu trugen die damen bei hofe oft eine schleppe und einen kunstvoll genähten umhang .

( continued ) tunesien , das an der nord-östlichen spitze des afrikanischen kontinents liegt , besitzt eine beneidenswerte geografische lage .
es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .
der norden ist einerseits von einer mit pinienwäldern sowie mit eichen bewachsenen bergkette geschmückt , andererseits breiten sich fruchtbare ebenen aus , die zum großteil von zwei wasserläufen , dem qued mejerda und dem qued meliane bewässert werden .
die quelle des ersten liegt in algerien , die des zweiten am jebel bargou in der nähe von siliana .

la bienestar del huron es uno de los factores mas sobresalientes a la hora de de comprar una jaulas de hurones .
es verdad que los hurones pasan mucho tiempo afuera de sus jaulas jugando , pero tienes que considerar que no podras custodiar de el todo el dia .
habra momentos en los que tendra que hacer algo mas que velar por su mascota .
cuando estas lejos , es importante para preservar el interior de la jaula huron .
es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .

todo lo que usted quiere conocer sobre jaulas de hamsters antes de obtener un hamster consigua una jaula para hamsters a prueba de fugas , sencillo de limpiar y lo suficientemente amplia . si bien las jaulas modulares con los tubos son divertidos , pueden ser dificiles de limpiar y pobres en la ventilacion ( y los tubos pueden ser demasiado pequeñas para algunos hamsters sirios ) . es inceible la capacidad de un hamster para escapar de la jaula , son capaces de masticar paredes de plastico de forma sorprendentemente rapida ademas de pasar por espacios muy pequeños .
hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .

we also hate on the uo , sobriety , california and many other abominable topics !
here at the uo , getting the records you want can be sort of a hassle .
uo matters has attained public records from both the uo and osu and the difference in what each institution deems & # 8220 ; public & # 8221 ; or a & # 8220 ; conflict of interest & # 8221 ; is disturbing .
the difference in pay is understandable .
because go ducks ?
we & # 8217 ; re better than beavers right ?
we gotta keep out the riff raff .
uo matters has the story , too .
on that post you will find a screenshot of a bid war for a pair of official women & # 8217 ; s soccer shorts : but honestly am just saddened that the asuo mailing lists didn & # 8217 ; t forward any notice of the cheerleading tryouts .
i would have forked over 5 dollars any day to get a close up view of the cheerleaders in action .
wait , i take that back .
most of them are too orange for me .
sticking your head in the clouds and pretending the world is always a beautiful place may be appealing , but it is not reality .
yes , totally unforeseen by the asuo and supporters of the healthy campus initiative was the fact that a toothless ban on smoking wasn & # 8217 ; t going to stop smokers .
all it did was alienate and inconvenience people .
their response was to take their smoking to the uo borderlands where half-smoked cigs fall to the ground or flow into the sewers .

the objectives of the reporter are to foster a sense of community among the jewish susy struble : well , i ’ m a 1993 graduate of the college .
i grew up in a small town in ohio , and it was just an enormous deal for me to come from a public school in a tiny , midwestern farm town and go to dartmouth college .
it meant a lot to my family and it meant a lot to me .
while i was there , i had an amazing experience and i deeply love the place .
i was involved in the greek system , and loved that .
i definitely got involved in issues surrounding sexual assault [ and i ] was an early organizer with a group called greeks against rape , which tried to facilitate open discussions in the sororities and fraternities and between sororities and fraternities about the problems of sexual assault and harassment and general relationships between the sexes .
that was all during my junior and senior year , so that was about my level of my involvement when i was at the college .
since then , i ’ ve moved out west .
i live in the san francisco bay area right now and i ’ m a pretty active alumna , and when i became aware of the college ’ s ongoing problems with sexual assault , it was an obvious place for me to try to make a difference .

“ early on i developed an obsession for old things and a respect of old things .
and i developed a respect for ethnicities , ” he says .
“ i grew up in a very multi-ethnic neighborhood : mexicans , greeks , italians , and japanese & # 8211 ; those were my friends .
“ i was so little .
the mummy was in a glass case ; i was eye level .
i remember the rest of the class being taken away .
i lingered alone with the mummy .
“ i traveled to mexico as a boy with my dad and uncles on fishing trips , ” he says .
“ that changed me considerably . part of the time i was on my own & # 8211 ; all alone .
part of the time was driving all night , getting to these places to fish .
“ i grew up on a cock-fighting ranch in eastern oklahoma in the 1950s … spending my summers there until i was 13 . ”
the interesting thing about smith is that he can make the connection from fighting cocks to the ancient greeks in the squeak of a marker on a white board .
“ even in my childhood experiences i see a lot of analogies , ” he says .
“ the greeks were into the fighting chickens … and giving gifts of roosters and even hens . and there are other places where chickens are important . ”
smith says that his time in the yucatán living with the mayans drew parallel lines for him to greece and fed his passion on all levels : the archaeologist , the cultural anthropologist , the linguistic anthropologist .
“ the mayans rejected the idea of malaria .
they say [ it happened ] because i was messing with the bees .
they said , & # 8216 ; you and that beekeeper did not apologize to the bees for the ones you killed when you were taking honey . & # 8217 ; we were supposed to apologize and go through a whole ritual , and we did not do it enough .
“ that is why they also said i got sick , because i was a … foreigner .
i was white ; i was not mayan . ”
despite all of his travels , all of his expertise , his focus now remains on mexico .
the team had lost its final two home games of the season .
the storm also faced a 21-point deficit in its semifinal game against big bend on the way to the championship .
but in the end , chemeketa still came out on top .
“ i have so much love for this group of kids .
and even though we struggled at times , i am so proud of how hard we fought and competed , and how mentally tough we were . ”
“ it was a struggle for us for 33 minutes , ” abderhalden said , perhaps understating the depth of the hole that chemeketa was in at the time .
but the storm put on a full-court press that stifled big bend .
chemeketa , which forced 21 turnovers during the course of the game , initiated a couple of key stops , hit a couple of threes , and went on a 27- 5 run to end up with a thrilling win .
begin hit the three that put the storm on top by one point with 40 seconds to go , and big bend , facing a smothering defense , couldn & # 8217 ; t get a basket in its final possession .
a runner from kauffman , a lay-up by phillips , and threes by batey and molan then put the storm on top .
edmonds began to heat up from the field , however , and they surged back to tie the game as time was running down .
momentum shifted once more as edmonds came roaring out of the box with a 14-2 run to start the second half .
batey converts a three-point-play , and he did so again midway through the second half of a backcourt steal .
then begin connected on a short jumper and came up with a steal and a flashy pass to batey for the lay-in .
chemeketa called a timeout to set-up a play that worked to perfection .
howard was able to beat his man off the dribble and get the bucket with 40 seconds remaining .
“ it was so awesome to win because of all the adversity we have overcome this season , ” molan said .
“ our goal at the start of the season was to win the nwacc title , and it was so great to play for each other and achieve that goal together . ”
molan was selected to the second team , batey was named to the first team , and phillips was named tournament mvp .
starr , who also serves as the adviser to the group , was initially responsible for bringing brito into the asc fold .
brito says , “ i was doing homework by the office when peter approached me .
we started talking , and then he asked me if i wanted a job as an asc .
i sat through an interview , filled out an application , and got the job . ”
starr says , “ one of the things asc members do a really good job of is voter registration .
we were able to register a ton of students to vote this year .
our purpose was to educate students why voting is vital .
“ i also thought our asc members did a great job of informing people about candidates without misinforming or angling the information . ”
brito says , “ we try to focus on local politics that are usually education-based .
our job is basically to fight for students here . ”
but thanks to a petition and a vote by the members of the asc , the proposal was not pursued .
in that case , at least , “ we were put in a position to lead , ” asc member aaron tagabuel says .
and the members of the asc seem to be a big fan of their boss .
“ he is a no-nonsense kind of a guy , but he is a joker at the same time , ” tagabuel says .
brito says , “ he is a really good mentor , and he is one of the chillest guys you will ever meet .
the other day we played hackie sack for 20 minutes with our boss .
who else does that with their superior ? ”
look at the picture of the asc members on the group & # 8217 ; s brochure and you & # 8217 ; ll see peopleof many different races and ethnicities .
“ we want to try to be as approachable as we possibly can to make students feel comfortable talking with us , ” brito says .
“ writing is like sex .
first you do it for love , then for friends , and finally for money . ”
thursday ’ s event was a chance to meet sullivan and hear about the experiences that he has had during the course of his writing and traveling .
“ i wanted to go the creative and freelance route .
so i got a creative writing degree from cornel , ” he said .
he was not naïve , however .
sullivan said that writing “ does help to keep the day job .
there are not a lot of opportunities out there , and freelance writing can be just as stressful as journalism . ”
and so he was forced to start writing as a freelance journalist , providing occasional articles for various newspapers .
it was not lucrative .
sullivan also encouraged the use of similes and metaphors : “ it ’ s true you can overdo these , but they can also be fun to do .
it ’ s really important you make sure you use the right metaphor for what you are talking about , though . ”
he said he was confident about his knowledge of the state ’ s geography , but he does not often write with a descriptive tone .
bill mccoy , a chemeketa student , said he attended because he has a “ love for nature and a love of exploring nature , and i want to become better at describing my experiences to family and friends . ”
“ i get to go hiking for a living .
i really enjoy it , ” he said .
the result is a new area called the veteran & # 8217 ; s lounge .
future plans call for the additions of a computer and a mini-fridge .
cindy ramey , a second-year chemeketa student , is one of the users of the lounge .
ramey was in the military for nearly eight years , serving two tours in iraq .
“ i love that we have a place to go to get away from the chaos of other students .
sometimes it is too much to be around so many people where it can get be really loud , ” she said . & # 8220 ; i love that i can go into the lounge [ and ] do my homework in peace and quiet . ” • shortstop gecy bowman who led the storm in batting average ( .396 ) , homeruns ( 8 ) , and was second in runs batted in ( 21 ) • pitcher kristina meza who had the lowest earned run average in the team last season ( 4.67 ) • sophomore pitcher carrie bess who led all chemeketa pitchers in wins and strikeouts while having an era of 6.24 . • sophomore third basemen danielle upton who had 4 homeruns last year and an rbi of 21 .
