last week , many of you no doubt watched on tv and read the newspaper in horror as wildfires raged around the pikes peak region .
“ i loved baseball , and i couldn ’ t play , ” bull said .
“ but no one ever told me i couldn ’ t skateboard , so i did . ”
“ i did my best to have as much fun as i could , ” she said .
“ i didn ’ t purposely make big splashes . ”
“ if you hit a pebble , the board would stop and you ’ d keep going , ” she said .
she recalled a time when her board got stuck in a crack , launching her into the air and causing her to flip and land on her “ rear end . ”
however , she said she preferred this option to doing a “ face plant . ”
“ back then skating and surfing were really connected , ” bull said .
“ all the moves that you would do on a skateboard were the same as you would do on a wave .
now the sports and tricks are completely different . ”
in addition to kick turns , 360s and wheelies ( now called manuals ) , bull said early skateboarders did a lot of “ walking moves , ” attempting to get as close to the nose of the board as possible .
a popular trick was the “ nose wheelie , ” which was a lot like “ hanging ten ” on a surfboard , a trick that was accomplished when surfers got all 10 of their toes over the nose of their board .
she added , “ i loved all sports .
[ skateboarding ] was just another sport to try to excel and get better at . ”
but she said skateboarding was “ definitely a big part ” of her life .
“ my sister was the most graceful [ on the team ] and had a moderation for stability and centering , ” he said .
bearer was originally a member of the makaha skateboard team . according to “ scarred for life , ” makaha skateboards was founded in 1963 by larry stevenson who also published surfguide magazine .
in the book , fitzpatrick estimated that a “ bona fide ” makaha skateboard team was formed by the summer of 1964 , and he recalled bearer as being one of the “ main guys ” on the team .
although she was a member of the hobie team , bull said she didn ’ t consider herself a professional skateboarder because she wasn ’ t paid .
however , hobie supplied her with skateboards , and the team had matching uniforms . for example , she said the boys got to go on a cross-country tour in a recreational vehicle , but she didn ’ t get to go because there wasn ’ t a female chaperone available . “ it wasn ’ t like i wasn ’ t as good as the boys , ” bull said . bull said she usually skated barefoot , but the hobie team offered to buy her a pair of vans skateboarding shoes before the competition .
she said she was so excited to own a pair of the name-brand shoes that she didn ’ t care that they didn ’ t have any in her size , and she wore a pair that were one or two sizes too big for her in the competition .
the photograph was the inspiration for a painting of bull that will be hung at the ishof in simi valley , calif .
“ once i went on to college , i just skated and surfed recreationally , ” she said .
laughing , she asked , “ what am i going to do , walk around with a sign on me that says , ‘ i used to skateboard ? ’ ” he married linda a. cully in 1980 .
he was married to shan rainey in 1953 , and she died in 1977 .

after the bad local election results , beppe grillo is now conductingan old-fashioned purge of his movimento 5 stelle , triggered by criticism of his leadership style by an m5s senator – as we had reported .
grillo has now taken his battle against adele gambero to the next level , by forcing an online plebiscite with the motion to expel her from the party .
the move is supported by a narrow majority of the m5s mps – which as the ft suggests could indicate that the party might split over this .
la repubblica talked about mobbing in a front page editorial , recalling the prediction of a commentator who had observed a few months ago that the real test of any new party is how it will deal with dissent .
that question has now been comprehensive answered .

blackjack är ett populärt spel som har sina rötter i kortspelet 21 , ett hasardspel som spelats i flera hundra år i europa .
oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .
blackjack cardcounting ( korträkning ) har existerat länge , men fick större spridning efter att casinoägaren harold smith publicerade boken ” i want to quit winners ” år 1961 och den amerikanske matematikern dr. edward o. thorp publicerade sin bok ” beat the dealer ” år 1962 .

( continued ) t-shirts gibt es in vielen verschiedenen farben , größe und von unterschiedlichen marken .
jedoch ist es bestimmt jedem schon einmal passiert , dass er sein lieblingsshirt an einer anderen person gesehen hat .
hier wünscht man sich , ein eigenes , individuelles shirt , welches man nur selbst besitzt .
sicherheitsschuhe sind stiefel oder halbschuhe , welche zum schutz getragen werden .
sie werden oft auch von beispielsweise berufsgenossenschaften vorgeschrieben .
zum einsatz kommen sicherheitsschuhe vor allem im bauwesen , in der industrie , im garten- und landschaftsbau , im rettungsdienst , bei der feuerwehr oder dem technischen hilfswerk .
sicherheitsschuhe haben am vorderen teil eine schutzkappe aus kunststoff oder metall , welche für den schutz der zehen vorgesehen ist .
das obermaterial ist meist aus leder und die sohle aus pu , gummi oder thermoplastischen elastomeren .
die chronische hyperglykämie bezeichnet man als diabetes mellitus , im volksmund auch als zuckerkrankheit bekannt .
es werden verschiedene formen der krankheit unterschieden , je nach der ursache der entstehung .
brisbane , cairns , das great barrier reef , die sunshine und gold coasts , fraser coast , bundaberg , die whitsundays und mackay stehen so gut da wie eh und je und bieten reisenden aus aller welt aufregende urlaubserlebnisse .
die betroffenen gebiete befinden sich grundsätzlich auf dem weg der besserung .
gleichzeitig hat der grossteil der tourismusanbieter , darunter unterkunftsbetriebe sowie anbieter von reisetouren und attraktionen , die geschäftstätigkeit fortgeführt und ist bereit für den empfang neuer besucher .
( continued ) über die damenmode im mittelalternatürlich hat sich die damenmode im laufe der geschichte gewandelt und weiter entwickelt .
im mittelalter trug die bauersfrau im wesentlichen lange einfach genähte kleider aus selbst gewebtem leinen stoff .
manchmal färbte man ihn mit naturfarben ein , die man aus blaubeeren , spinat roten rüben , walnuss schalen oder safran gewann .
unterwäsche trug man kaum außer in sehr kalten monaten ein hemd aus wolle oder leinen .
im sommer ging frau barfuß , im winter trug sie meist bund schuhe aus selbst gegerbtem leder , umwickelt mit hanfseil oder holz pantinen mit socken aus selbst geschorener , selbst gesponnener und selbst gestrickter schafwolle .
der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .
auch samt aus china wurde herangeschafft und zu schönen , langen bestickten und mit perlen genähten kleidern verarbeitet .
dazu trugen die damen bei hofe oft eine schleppe und einen kunstvoll genähten umhang .

( continued ) tunesien , das an der nord-östlichen spitze des afrikanischen kontinents liegt , besitzt eine beneidenswerte geografische lage .
es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .
der norden ist einerseits von einer mit pinienwäldern sowie mit eichen bewachsenen bergkette geschmückt , andererseits breiten sich fruchtbare ebenen aus , die zum großteil von zwei wasserläufen , dem qued mejerda und dem qued meliane bewässert werden .
die quelle des ersten liegt in algerien , die des zweiten am jebel bargou in der nähe von siliana .

writer juliet ashton is in a slump .
after writing an uplifting column during world war ii that was later turned into a book , she has success , but she is tired .
the war has taken it out of everyone and destroyed her home in london .
all she wants to do is write something different , something with a bit more substance , under her own name .
but finding a topic for a book is a difficult undertaking and one she struggles with .
there is no wonder the book was received so well .
told in the form of a series of letters , it is in a word , spectacular .
not only does it explore the wonders of reading , but also the triumphs of the human spirit .
the island is filled with ordinary people and yet once juliet scratches the surface , she sees just how extraordinary they all are .
i laughed out loud , i wept uncontrollably and i found myself missing my guernsey friends when the last page was turned .
if you are like me and missed out on the hoopla when this book was first released , i highly recommend you pick it up .
i give it an enthusiastic five-stars .

la bienestar del huron es uno de los factores mas sobresalientes a la hora de de comprar una jaulas de hurones .
es verdad que los hurones pasan mucho tiempo afuera de sus jaulas jugando , pero tienes que considerar que no podras custodiar de el todo el dia .
habra momentos en los que tendra que hacer algo mas que velar por su mascota .
cuando estas lejos , es importante para preservar el interior de la jaula huron .
es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .
vitalin o vitalin ferret es un alimento muy balanciado y difinitivamente para recomendar .
todo lo que usted quiere conocer sobre jaulas de hamsters antes de obtener un hamster consigua una jaula para hamsters a prueba de fugas , sencillo de limpiar y lo suficientemente amplia . si bien las jaulas modulares con los tubos son divertidos , pueden ser dificiles de limpiar y pobres en la ventilacion ( y los tubos pueden ser demasiado pequeñas para algunos hamsters sirios ) . es inceible la capacidad de un hamster para escapar de la jaula , son capaces de masticar paredes de plastico de forma sorprendentemente rapida ademas de pasar por espacios muy pequeños .
hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

¿ que variedad de comida deberia comer un pajaro segun su especie ?
las aves requieren una dieta equilibrada con mucha variedad de indicados tipos de alimentos que poseen vitaminas y minerales necesarios .
usted debe garantizar de no ofrecerle a las aves nueces o semillas , sino que se le debe ofrecer comida para pajaros con gran valor nutricional .
al momento de la eleccion de la comida , las aves son dificiles ya que prefieren los frutos de cascara y las semillas en vez de los alimentos sutanciosos .
¿ que debe usted conocer a la hora de elegir la comida para los periquitos ?
siempre y cuando su perico tenga cariño , buena comida y los cuidados apropiados , se va a transformar en uno de los preferidos amigos en su hogar .
siempre que la dieta no sea unicamente de semillas sera buena para los pericos .
que su periquito ingiera semillas todos los dias es comparable a que usted coma carne en todas las comidas , esto no es saludable a largo plazo .
principalmente deben comer pienso y los demas dias pueden comer una diversidad de alimentos frescos .
abrir la heladera o buscar en los gabinetes de cocina : asi de facil sera hacer la comida para periquitos .
en la comida para agapornis prevalecen las frutas , granos y semillas .
al igual que a los loros , a los agapornis en cautiverio se los tiene que alimentar con una dieta similar .
una buena comida para agapornis formulada en forma de granulos conforman la base de su dieta .
al ser tan altas en grasas , las semillas no deben ser mas del 25 % de su dieta , por mas que les fascinen. tambien se aconseja ofrecer al ave gran variedad de frutas frescas y hortalizas .
son muchos los frutos que les encantan , como por ejemplo , las bayas , los melocotones , los platanos , las uvas , naranjas , manzanas y el melon siempre que no tenga cascara .
la comida para canarios esta basada en semillas .
una mezcla de vitaminas y minerales es la ideal dieta para un canario .
que el canario se nutra principalmente con una dieta de semillas primas , ya sea con un alimento de huevo de abba , cede , quiko , orlux o higgins de calidad , es lo aconsejado para el propietario del canario domestico tipico .
otra excelente opcion es una dieta granulada que proporciona alimentos sustanciosos en cada bocado .
¿ que se aconseja al momento de seleccionar la comida para los loros ?
se recomienda una comida para loros que incluya una gran diversidad de alimentos nutritivos recien elaborados , un bajo porcentaje de semillas y una dieta formulada ( piensos ) , tenendo en cuenta los requerimientos nutricionales de las aves .
recuerde que la mayoria de las comidas recien preparadas se descomponen rapidamente y tienen que ser separados de la jaula despues de un par de horas .
si el ave no es facil aprobar los nuevos alimentos , trate de invitarles temprano en la mañana o por la noche , ocasiones en aves que viven en su habitat en busca de alimento en la naturaleza .
escoger el tipo de jaula para conejo es muy importante .
las jaulas para conejos que son lo suficientemente amplias , simples de limpiar y comodo para entrar y salir para su conejo , hara que compartir tu hogar con tu conejo mucho mas facil .
una jaula que es lo sobradamente amplia es esencial para el bienestar de su conejo , pero no es un sustituto para el ejercicio y el tiempo de estar fuera de la jaula .
en el mercado hay ofrecidas un millon de jaulas que no son las aconsejadas para los conejos .
algunas son demasiado pequeñas , y muchas tienen pisos de alambre , que puede hacer la limpieza mas sencillo , pero que no brindan mucho consuelo para el conejo .
generalmente , mas grande es mejor .
si su conejo se pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo en una jaula , entonces , es mejor obtener la jaula mas amplia que sea practico en el hogar .
una guia util es calcular el tamaño de la jaula como veces el medida de tu conejo .
para los conejos grandes de mas de 8 kilos se aconseja una jaula de 30 " por 36 " y para los mas chicos una de 24 " por 36 " van bien .
asi mismo las jaulas conejos que tienen pisos y rampas que une a estos niveles suelen agradarles mucho a los conejos .
una de las cosas a remarcar es que la puerta debe ser lo bastante grande como para sacar al conejo y poder limpiar el lecho de arena .
una puerta lateral es posiblemente el mejor , como una primera abertura de la jaula hace que adquirir el conejo y un poco mas dificultoso ( y lo mejor es que el conejo pueda entrar y salir por su cuenta ) .
es vital revisar que la entrada tenga los rebordes lisos o cubiertos de plastico para evitar que el conejo o tu s lastimen .

phillips is player of the year ; abderhalden is coach of the year three players on chemeketa ’ s men ’ s team and two players on the storm women ’ s were named to the nwacc all-league team for the south region .
coach david abderhalden also was named the coach of the year in the conference .
outside hitter mikayla morgan , outside hitter keri stein , and designated setter jourdan wenzinger ( volleyball ) ; “ we wanted to … establish where we are now on how the classroom recycling was going , see what kind of things were still going into the trash , and what changes we can make to accommodate so we can get [ the college ’ s ] trash down to as low as possible . ”
“ we put on gloves , we dig through it ; it ’ s kind of gross , but it doesn ’ t take a long time , and it ’ s kind of fun and interesting , ” fregosi said , explaining what is involved with volunteering for an audit .
“ we knew we had to make adjustments in game two because we did not hit the ball well at all in the first game . ”
bowman then scored on a rbi groundout to second , putting the storm up 3-0 .
hotaling gave up a run in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch but was able to limit the damage .
hotaling mowed down the lower columbia hitters in the fourth and the fifth innings .
she faced a little bit of trouble in the sixth when she gave up two runs on three hits , but she was able to strike out a pinch hitter with runners on second and third to end the inning .
hotaling was able to shut down lower columbia ’ s top-of-the-order hitters in order in the bottom of the seventh to seal the victory .
even though the storm dropped two in a row on saturday to mt .
hood , the team is still in the playoff hunt .
chemeketa has a gem tucked away on the east side of campus .
from a distance , you can & # 8217 ; t see anything more than a few greenhouses and some plants .
up close , however , there is a passion for plants – and from now until mid-june , students , staff , and the community are able to partake in thehorticulture program ’ s plant sale .
the greenhouses are located between the red and brown parking lots on the east side of campus .
one of those students is brianna lucas . she has attended chemeketa for two and a half years and recently graduated from the program .
lucas now is working on flowers in the floriculture program .
she said that she liked being around the plants and wantedto possibly one day own a flower shop .
christeena deroo is currently one of three employees at the greenhouses .
she was the first graduate from thehorticulture program nearly three years ago and wanted to stay involved on campus .
deroo knows all about the greenhouses and what it takes to educate students thoroughly .
“ we have a diverse system in our greenhouses , ” she said .
“ students get to see so many set-ups ; we have to have a broad range . ”
another officially member of the staff is rozie , a 3-year-old cat who hangs out in the warmth of the greenhouses .
the soft carpet tickles between her toes at the early hours of the morning .
“ depending on the day , my feet hit the floor around 5 : 30 a.m. , ” fay demeyer says .
but demeyer is no one-note wonder .
along with teaching psychology classes at chemeketa on tuesdays and thursdays , she also : teaches for the university of phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays ; demeyer also serves as the chairman of the march of dimes foundation and is currently working on two projects for the organization : bowties for babies and high hopes .
“ when i get home , i organize my planner and my clothes for the next day , ” she says , ensuring that her outfits are appropriate for what ’ s ahead .
“ throughout my life , i have overcome a lot .
i came out of foster care and was illiterate until my mid-teens , ” she says .
the craziness of her schedule doesn ’ t affect what happens in her classes , however .
but balance is important to her as well .
that shows up in her social life .
“ i love riding my motorcycle with my husband , phil , and being together .
we ’ ve ran half-marathons , and we ’ re always working on how we can improve our businesses , ” she says .
she even has time for barbecues and spending time with her granddaughter , madi , who is 4 .
“ work to me is not eight hours a day , ” she says .
“ it ’ s from the moment i wake up till the moment my head hits the pillow .
i was raised as a migrant worker and was used to working long hours with no sleep . ”
“ i am always looking for resources to make my life easier .
i drink lots of mountain dew and have low carb protein bars throughout the day .
i save my big meal for when i get home so i can eat with my husband , ” she says .
“ the way i look at it , you have the days you have , so what are you going to do with them ? ”
“ i usually have 30 to 45 minutes of quiet time to reflect on myself .
what do i want to present ?
what are my goals ?
is what i am teaching going to move me closer or further away to those goals ? ”
her dreams keep her occupied for a time before she drifts off to sleep , she says .
but the sound of the alarm clock arrives quickly , and once again her feet slide off the bed and she races off to yet another busy day .
come for the wine , but stay for the education you have been cordially invited to a learning event the northwest viticulture center in the eola hills in west salem is a largely unknown entity of chemeketa .
“ it was one of the nicer days we had had in a while , so the backdoor was opened up to the vineyard just beyond , and this gorgeous jazz was playing throughout the sound system .
“ as i walked by and saw all this , i thought , ‘ you know , if any prospective student could be standing here , looking at this scene , just taking it all in , they would sign-up on the spot ’ – it was so evocative and inviting . ”
and although he ’ s new to the viticulture center , adams says the eola campus is an outstanding place for a person to need to travel to each day .
“ and then you learn how to make wine on top of it .
why not ? ” he says .
the driveway to the campus does a splendid job of preparing visitors for the beauty awaiting them at the top of the hill .
the patio on the backside of bldg. 1 overlooks those 8 acres , as well as the willamette river and the grassy willamette valley below .
at eola , macdonald says , “ we take it from the grape , to the wine , to the sales . ”
“ it just opens up a lot more doors for people . ”
“ i don ’ t know of any of our students who have gone through the whole program that haven ’ t gone out and been able to find a job in the wine world , ” watson says .
the repercussion of these programs on the wine economy , and within the wine industry , is profound .
cortell says that between osu and eola , there has been “ quite a few years of adding a lot of educational value that helps raise the bar and the quality and the status of oregon wines .
“ we ’ ve had a lot of good students come through .
and those of us on the faculty – we ’ ve also worked in the industry , so we come with a lot of industry experience .
“ i lost my job in 2011 , ” fischer says , “ and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to re-examine my life – to think about what my next step was going to be .
for a student or career-minded individual who has a passion for wine , and also may be looking for an employment opportunity within a thriving business economy , eola stands as an excellent option .
“ late in the evening , ” adams says , “ looking out over the vineyard at the sun just beginning to set in the west – amazing . ”
“ if there is nothing else you walk a way with from this class and trip , it & # 8217 ; s that i can make a difference . there is a lot of pride of indigenous community , and if you are a photographer you should bring a camera . it is beautiful ! ”
the questions : how would you feel about a tuition increase ?
and if tuition is raised , where do you want the money to go ?
“ but students are still not rising to the challenge , ” he said .
“ as students , our job is to inform the decision-making process of the administration , ” he said .
“ if no one steps up to voice their opinion , then [ the administration ] is just going to go on whatever they think is best . ”
“ quite honestly , ” cutz said , “ i believe the decision was already made .
the asc represented students , but i don & # 8217 ; t believe it was as big a factor in the board & # 8217 ; s decision-making process as we would have liked it to have been . ”
“ i think accessibility is going to be tough , ” she said .
the views expressed in the courier online edition are not necessarily those of the college or the administration .
brasilia — & ldquo ; this is the moment to show that the whole of brazil is fighting , and that we have a voice .
