the central bank had imposed a withdrawal limit for boc and laiki of € 100 .
it is also not clear when and whether the capital controls will be lifted .
the ft has an interesting comment from guntram wolff , of bruegel , who said that by agreed to capital controls , the ecb had effectively introduced a new currency in cyprus , as a cypriot euro is now obviously not the same as a normal euro if you cannot take it out of the country .
luigi guiso and guido tabellini are calling for a european bad bank ; on friday , giorgio napolitano gave pier luigi bersani the official mandate to form a government .
as il corriere della sera reports , the partito democratico leader is seeking an alliance with silvio berlusconi ’ s popolo della libertà and beppe grillo ’ movimento 5 stelle .
as il corriere remarks , the bersani mandate is very limited and that there is the possibility that it the result will be inconclusive .
in that case , napolitano will give a mandate to berlusconi or grillo .
matteo renzi pretends that he is ready to support bersani – for now ; this looks to us that renzi wants to be supportive now because he may need bersani and the party establishment once he has a go .
there is a lot of talk about a breakup of the pd , which would play in the hands of grillo .
it took us a while this morning to find an intelligent summary of cyprus plan b. the best we found , hat tip ft alphaville was am analytical summary by george saravelos of deutsche bank , and this morning ’ s news coverage by kathimerini and suddeutsche zeitung .

berlusconi is flirting with pd to form a grand coalition ; berlusconi is flirting with pd to form a grand coalition cyprus ’ plan b include a € 4.2 billion transfer of pension-fund assets , but the troika rejects this , as this would only constitute an accounting operation at the other end of which would be in increase in debt .
the second leg of plan b is to transfer the bad assets of laiki and bank of cyprus to a bad bank , and sell the remainder to russia ’ s vtb bank – but the russian already said no .

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

the pioneer log : congratulations on your appointment to the board of trustees !
at 26 , how do you plan on using your age proxim- ity to serve as a voice for the student body ?
i started out at lewis & clark and i was super awkward .
horribly awkward .
and i was angry that i didn 't go to mit or tech school .
but the teachers were amazing , and i learned about anthropol- ogy and found some kids whowanted to build a business and do entrepreneurship , and so i ended up working with them on it and we got support from the school .
we hadn ’ t really seen the president or any of the staff , and we didn ’ t even know if we could talk to them .
you know , they weren ’ t present at any event .
they didn ’ t really help out .
and so we tried to reach out and get an appointment with the president .
and [ vice president ] david ellis helped us out .
and he believed in us even though we were these really an- noying , scrappy kids who were 19 .
ha !
well , i don ’ t really con- sider it financial security .
[ laughs ] i didn ’ t do it because of money .
for instance , i don ’ t do anything because there ’ s money involved .
ido it because it ’ s interesting .
and i was so intrigued by this larger company [ esri ] because they ’ ve been around for so long that i wanted to be a part of them and examine how they work .
basically , here ’ s a new tribe that i want to look at .
in terms of financial security , it ’ s weird .
[ laughs ] i think the main thing is that when i was younger i didn ’ t have any resources .
i couldn ’ t go on any trips to other countries .
i just didn ’ t have anything , and i didn ’ t notice fora long time because my parents never let me know that we didn ’ t have a lot of money .
once i found out that i was , like , the lowest social class possible , especially at lewis & clark , it was really awkward and i wanted to say , ’ well , what ’ s wrong with me , why can ’ t i go to other countries , why can ’ t i do things that , for some people , are the norm ? ’ and so i said , ’ i ’ ll just work my ass off to where i ’ ll finally be able to be middle class and see what it ’ s like ’ .
and so a lot of it was just trying to catch up to what people have been automatically born into .
now i ’ m there .
now i get paidto fly around the world , which iscool .
mostly , i ’ m interested in going to those places .
why do you believe entrepreneurship is the right direction for lc ?
if you could advise current lc students to do one thing today , what would it be ?
shift some of your classes so you have one day a week where you go out and start exploring so that you can mitigate that transition from school to the real world and so you can learn as much as you can while you 're in a stable environment , so that when you get out you ’ re not just on the street .
the faster you can get on your feet and understand how the world works , the better .
you have to grab things .
things won ’ t be given to you anymore .
there ’ s just so much competition and everyone ’ s got a freakin ’ college degree .
you know so much about me because you did a google search and watched my ted talk .
and i didn ’ t have to talk to you in physical person before .
it ’ s so efficient .
the album ’ s opener , & ldquo ; mayonnaise , & rdquo ; is jangly and fuzzy in all the right ways , sounding a bit like san francisco ’ s sonny and the sunsets with just a tinge of post-punk malcontent .
other tracks , like the standout & ldquo ; head on the ground , & rdquo ; provide enough pop smarts to keep listeners captivated but change things up sporadically to keep everything fresh .

si el perro sera una mascota de interior , seleccione una ubicacion donde no moleste , que sea fresco y este perfectamente ventilado .
si a un cachorro se le permite dormir en la cama del amo , en un futuro se trasnformara en unfastidiosos socio .
si el perro va a vivir al aire libre debe estar refugiados contra el viento y la lluvia por una casa de perro que se puede encontrar en cualquier tienda de perros .
la casa debe tener suficiente espacio como para que el perro quepa de lleno y de una un giro de un circulo completo antes de acostarse .
durante los meses de invierno , una tela gruesa debe ser puesta sobre la puerta para mantener el calor y impedir que el viento y la humedad ingresen .

es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .

hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .

nosotros somos lo que comemos , esto es valido también para los gatos que requieren de nosotros en cuanto a albergue y comida .

antes de seguir hay que cubrir algunos de los conceptos basicos , esto ayudara a lograr el objetivo de este articulo que es simplificarte la seleccion de la comida para gatos , enseñando a leer el rotulo de los piensos para gatos .
lo que tiene que conocer de las necesidades nutricionales esenciales de los gatos .
proteina de la carne , el pescado o aves de corral eso es lo que debe saber basicamente , aunque los gatos no necesitan hidratos de carbono , el maiz , el trigo y / o el arroz se utilizan como material de relleno para los alimentos enlatados y pienso gatos .
otros componentes , tales como aglutinantes , aromatizantes y colorantes , los fabricantes de comida para gato los añaden para satisfacer las exigencias esteticas de los compradores .
la comida enlatada no debe permanecer gran tiempo fuera aunque los preservativos utilizados mantengan los alimentos frescos para nuestros gatos .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

aqui hallara toda lainformacion y una guia de como tener cuidado una chinchilla , que cuidados debe tener , y cuales son los accesorios inpresindibles para manteneren la casa para una chinchilla .
con un manejo reposado desde una temprana edad la mayoria de las chinchillas se hara muy sumisas y estaran cerca con sus propietarios , aunque a veces no les gusta que se carguen o los abracen .
las chinchillas pueden encontrarse solas o juntas , pero de estar con otra chinchilla es recomendable que sean del mismo sexo , o hermanas o que esten juntas desde una temprana edad .
las chinchillas son muy energicas y vivarachas .
sus habitos son nocturnos , por lo que las chinchillas son mucho mas energicas durante la noche . los picos mas altos de actividad son durante cuando esta amaneciendo o durante el atardecer , por lo que se le suele llamar crepuscular . de todas maneras , deben ponerse en una zona bastante pasificadurante el dia .
los habitosy tener horarios para la alimentacion es muy importante ya que las mismas se estresan si hay cambios en su rutina diaria .
ya que las chinchillas son muy activas y les gusta jugar , necesitan su sitio para realizar ejercicio por lo que la jaulas chinchillas debe ser grande . para las chinchillas provenientes de temperaturas frias se deben tener cuidados de no ubicarlas en lugares muy calidos ya que el exeso de temperaturas les puede perjudicar .
para atesorar a las chinchillas sanas , una buena y euilibrado regimen de calidad es sumamente necesario . su sistema digestivo esta diseniado para comida para chinchillas con mucha fibra , por lo que una buena dieta debe tener mucha fibra y un monton de heno para chinchillas que es una hierba . una dieta inapropiada puede causar graves desordenes estomacales y contratiempo de salud . como algunas personas , las chinchillas tienen un diente dulce y pueden anteponeralimentarse cosas que no son oportunas para ellos por lo que se debe usar con cuidado . las chinchillas requieren una gran cantidad de forraje , y el regimen ante todo debe estar consistido de una hierba de heno de buena calidad , junto con bolitas elaboradas de chinchillas una cucharadita por dia en total . el sistema digestivo de las chinchillas es bastante perceptivo por lo que cualquier modificacion en el regimen debe ser gradual . las hermosas chinchillas tienen un deseo insaciable de roer .

estos dientes deben ser continuamente desgastado al roer .

el bano de polvo solo debe ponerse a disposicion de la chinchilla de forma alternadamente para que la misma pueda preservar su gruesa piel en forma optima.tenga en cuenta que no es recomendable proveer un bano de agua a una chinchilla esto no solo ayudara a revolcarse en el polvo para concervar su piel tersa y sedosa de espesor , que se cree que es relajante y divertido para chinchillas . otros polvos o granos de arena pueden verse o sentirse similar , pero no va a desempenarse de la igual forma - el polvo de chinchilla se hace para imitar lo que se tiene acceso en su habitat natural .

“ i traveled to mexico as a boy with my dad and uncles on fishing trips , ” he says .
“ that changed me considerably . part of the time i was on my own & # 8211 ; all alone .
part of the time was driving all night , getting to these places to fish .
“ i grew up on a cock-fighting ranch in eastern oklahoma in the 1950s … spending my summers there until i was 13 . ”
the interesting thing about smith is that he can make the connection from fighting cocks to the ancient greeks in the squeak of a marker on a white board .
“ even in my childhood experiences i see a lot of analogies , ” he says .
“ the greeks were into the fighting chickens … and giving gifts of roosters and even hens . and there are other places where chickens are important . ”
smith says that his time in the yucatán living with the mayans drew parallel lines for him to greece and fed his passion on all levels : the archaeologist , the cultural anthropologist , the linguistic anthropologist .
“ the mayans rejected the idea of malaria .
they say [ it happened ] because i was messing with the bees .
they said , & # 8216 ; you and that beekeeper did not apologize to the bees for the ones you killed when you were taking honey . & # 8217 ; we were supposed to apologize and go through a whole ritual , and we did not do it enough .
“ that is why they also said i got sick , because i was a … foreigner .
i was white ; i was not mayan . ”
despite all of his travels , all of his expertise , his focus now remains on mexico .
the team had lost its final two home games of the season .
the storm also faced a 21-point deficit in its semifinal game against big bend on the way to the championship .
but in the end , chemeketa still came out on top .
“ i have so much love for this group of kids .
and even though we struggled at times , i am so proud of how hard we fought and competed , and how mentally tough we were . ”
“ it was a struggle for us for 33 minutes , ” abderhalden said , perhaps understating the depth of the hole that chemeketa was in at the time .
but the storm put on a full-court press that stifled big bend .
chemeketa , which forced 21 turnovers during the course of the game , initiated a couple of key stops , hit a couple of threes , and went on a 27- 5 run to end up with a thrilling win .
begin hit the three that put the storm on top by one point with 40 seconds to go , and big bend , facing a smothering defense , couldn & # 8217 ; t get a basket in its final possession .
a runner from kauffman , a lay-up by phillips , and threes by batey and molan then put the storm on top .
edmonds began to heat up from the field , however , and they surged back to tie the game as time was running down .
momentum shifted once more as edmonds came roaring out of the box with a 14-2 run to start the second half .
batey converts a three-point-play , and he did so again midway through the second half of a backcourt steal .
then begin connected on a short jumper and came up with a steal and a flashy pass to batey for the lay-in .
chemeketa called a timeout to set-up a play that worked to perfection .
howard was able to beat his man off the dribble and get the bucket with 40 seconds remaining .
“ it was so awesome to win because of all the adversity we have overcome this season , ” molan said .
“ our goal at the start of the season was to win the nwacc title , and it was so great to play for each other and achieve that goal together . ”
molan was selected to the second team , batey was named to the first team , and phillips was named tournament mvp .
starr , who also serves as the adviser to the group , was initially responsible for bringing brito into the asc fold .
brito says , “ i was doing homework by the office when peter approached me .
we started talking , and then he asked me if i wanted a job as an asc .
i sat through an interview , filled out an application , and got the job . ”
starr says , “ one of the things asc members do a really good job of is voter registration .
we were able to register a ton of students to vote this year .
our purpose was to educate students why voting is vital .
“ i also thought our asc members did a great job of informing people about candidates without misinforming or angling the information . ”
brito says , “ we try to focus on local politics that are usually education-based .
our job is basically to fight for students here . ”
but thanks to a petition and a vote by the members of the asc , the proposal was not pursued .
in that case , at least , “ we were put in a position to lead , ” asc member aaron tagabuel says .
and the members of the asc seem to be a big fan of their boss .
“ he is a no-nonsense kind of a guy , but he is a joker at the same time , ” tagabuel says .
brito says , “ he is a really good mentor , and he is one of the chillest guys you will ever meet .
the other day we played hackie sack for 20 minutes with our boss .
who else does that with their superior ? ”
look at the picture of the asc members on the group & # 8217 ; s brochure and you & # 8217 ; ll see peopleof many different races and ethnicities .
“ we want to try to be as approachable as we possibly can to make students feel comfortable talking with us , ” brito says .
“ writing is like sex .
first you do it for love , then for friends , and finally for money . ”
thursday ’ s event was a chance to meet sullivan and hear about the experiences that he has had during the course of his writing and traveling .
“ i wanted to go the creative and freelance route .
so i got a creative writing degree from cornel , ” he said .
he was not naïve , however .
sullivan said that writing “ does help to keep the day job .
there are not a lot of opportunities out there , and freelance writing can be just as stressful as journalism . ”
and so he was forced to start writing as a freelance journalist , providing occasional articles for various newspapers .
it was not lucrative .
sullivan also encouraged the use of similes and metaphors : “ it ’ s true you can overdo these , but they can also be fun to do .
it ’ s really important you make sure you use the right metaphor for what you are talking about , though . ”
he said he was confident about his knowledge of the state ’ s geography , but he does not often write with a descriptive tone .
bill mccoy , a chemeketa student , said he attended because he has a “ love for nature and a love of exploring nature , and i want to become better at describing my experiences to family and friends . ”
“ i get to go hiking for a living .
i really enjoy it , ” he said .
the result is a new area called the veteran & # 8217 ; s lounge .
future plans call for the additions of a computer and a mini-fridge .
cindy ramey , a second-year chemeketa student , is one of the users of the lounge .
ramey was in the military for nearly eight years , serving two tours in iraq .
“ i love that we have a place to go to get away from the chaos of other students .
sometimes it is too much to be around so many people where it can get be really loud , ” she said . & # 8220 ; i love that i can go into the lounge [ and ] do my homework in peace and quiet . ” • shortstop gecy bowman who led the storm in batting average ( .396 ) , homeruns ( 8 ) , and was second in runs batted in ( 21 ) • pitcher kristina meza who had the lowest earned run average in the team last season ( 4.67 ) • sophomore pitcher carrie bess who led all chemeketa pitchers in wins and strikeouts while having an era of 6.24 . • sophomore third basemen danielle upton who had 4 homeruns last year and an rbi of 21 .
it wasn ’ t all that long ago that the lines on the first day of the winter term went right out the financial aid office door and down a hallway .
the reason is that they can add up quickly and take a long time to repay .

that ’ s the way it has been for jud hale ( “ please remember it ’ s spelled with just one ‘ d ’ ” , he reminds me ) .
jud has been a part of yankee magazine and the old farmer ’ s almanac for many years and he has no plans to retire .
“ as long as i can make it up the stairs , i will be here , ” he laughs as he describes the route to his office at yankee publishing in dublin , nh .
jud landed the job at yankee ( “ my first job was to take out the trash and make up reader letters , ” he says ) after he got out of the army .
“ i was looking for a job and my mother said to call her brother robb ; he ran a little magazine called yankee and he might find a job for me .
“ uncle robb hired me , ” he continues , “ and i expected i would be at the magazine for no more than a year .
but i got married and i loved the area .
the job turned into a career and then it turned into my life . ”

and what about the time when he can ’ t make it up those office stairs any longer ?
( jud laughs when it ’ s pointed out to him he just might not be 21 any longer ! )

when you are out exploring the rural areas of the new hampshire countryside , it is pretty common to see farms with horses , cows , sheep , and chickens . but how often have you come across an alpaca farm ? for most of us , i ’ m guessing that the answer would probably be “ never ” or “ what ’ s an alpaca ? ”
“ in 2002 , i was deployed to the pentagon for a year as a member of the national guard , ” bruce recalls .
“ afterwards , we relocated and moved up to holderness where we had bought some property and built a house . my wife , who was a knitter , was interested in learning to spin , and one mother ’ s day weekend about six or seven years ago , we went over to hopkinton to attend the new hampshire sheep and wool festival . there were some alpacas at the festival , and when we felt the fleece , we liked the softness of it . i then bought my wife a spinner for her birthday . ”
“ what we intended to do originally was to breed the animals and sell them , ” bruce continues . “ but then the economy tanked , so we have shifted our focus to agricultural fairs and alpaca festivals , as well as doing more commercially with the fleece , which is valued for its softness and warmth , and unlike the wool from sheep , alpaca fleece has no lanolin , so it is also hypo-allergenic . ”
the alpacas get shorn every may , when the fleece has grown to about four inches thick . “ we have a professional come in to shear off the fleece and bag it into firsts , seconds , and thirds , ” bruce says . “ the seconds and thirds , which are shorn from the animal ’ s neck and legs , are sent off to the new england alpaca fiber pool for credits to use to buy products that they make , such as mittens , hats , and so on .
