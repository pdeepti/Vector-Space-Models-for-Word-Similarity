the photo was posted by allan ford on the website filmofilia.com.
the affectionate villain gru and his adorable minions are back in the hilarious and exciting family friendly sequel to “ despicable me . ”
for mothers , “ despicable me 2 ” had more of a romantic element than the original .
gru , the grumpy and reclusive ex-villain found love in this sequel , even after trying to run as far away from it as he could .
even his daughters could see that he needed a girlfriend and tried to set him up on an internet dating site .
of course , comedy played a major role in the sequel , just as it did in the original .
the yellow and round minions were comedic gold with children and had a big role to play in “ despicable me 2 . ”
there was more of a spotlight on these incomprehensible but adorable helpers as parts of their personalities were highlighted .

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

( continued ) t-shirts gibt es in vielen verschiedenen farben , größe und von unterschiedlichen marken .
jedoch ist es bestimmt jedem schon einmal passiert , dass er sein lieblingsshirt an einer anderen person gesehen hat .
hier wünscht man sich , ein eigenes , individuelles shirt , welches man nur selbst besitzt .
sicherheitsschuhe sind stiefel oder halbschuhe , welche zum schutz getragen werden .
sie werden oft auch von beispielsweise berufsgenossenschaften vorgeschrieben .
zum einsatz kommen sicherheitsschuhe vor allem im bauwesen , in der industrie , im garten- und landschaftsbau , im rettungsdienst , bei der feuerwehr oder dem technischen hilfswerk .
sicherheitsschuhe haben am vorderen teil eine schutzkappe aus kunststoff oder metall , welche für den schutz der zehen vorgesehen ist .
das obermaterial ist meist aus leder und die sohle aus pu , gummi oder thermoplastischen elastomeren .
die chronische hyperglykämie bezeichnet man als diabetes mellitus , im volksmund auch als zuckerkrankheit bekannt .
es werden verschiedene formen der krankheit unterschieden , je nach der ursache der entstehung .
brisbane , cairns , das great barrier reef , die sunshine und gold coasts , fraser coast , bundaberg , die whitsundays und mackay stehen so gut da wie eh und je und bieten reisenden aus aller welt aufregende urlaubserlebnisse .
die betroffenen gebiete befinden sich grundsätzlich auf dem weg der besserung .
gleichzeitig hat der grossteil der tourismusanbieter , darunter unterkunftsbetriebe sowie anbieter von reisetouren und attraktionen , die geschäftstätigkeit fortgeführt und ist bereit für den empfang neuer besucher .
( continued ) über die damenmode im mittelalternatürlich hat sich die damenmode im laufe der geschichte gewandelt und weiter entwickelt .
im mittelalter trug die bauersfrau im wesentlichen lange einfach genähte kleider aus selbst gewebtem leinen stoff .
manchmal färbte man ihn mit naturfarben ein , die man aus blaubeeren , spinat roten rüben , walnuss schalen oder safran gewann .
unterwäsche trug man kaum außer in sehr kalten monaten ein hemd aus wolle oder leinen .
im sommer ging frau barfuß , im winter trug sie meist bund schuhe aus selbst gegerbtem leder , umwickelt mit hanfseil oder holz pantinen mit socken aus selbst geschorener , selbst gesponnener und selbst gestrickter schafwolle .
der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .
auch samt aus china wurde herangeschafft und zu schönen , langen bestickten und mit perlen genähten kleidern verarbeitet .
dazu trugen die damen bei hofe oft eine schleppe und einen kunstvoll genähten umhang .

( continued ) tunesien , das an der nord-östlichen spitze des afrikanischen kontinents liegt , besitzt eine beneidenswerte geografische lage .
es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .
der norden ist einerseits von einer mit pinienwäldern sowie mit eichen bewachsenen bergkette geschmückt , andererseits breiten sich fruchtbare ebenen aus , die zum großteil von zwei wasserläufen , dem qued mejerda und dem qued meliane bewässert werden .
die quelle des ersten liegt in algerien , die des zweiten am jebel bargou in der nähe von siliana .
beide münden in den golf von tunis .
die meisten unfälle passieren nicht im verkehr , sondern zu hause .
denn im haushalt lauern viele gefahren .
herumliegende gegenstände , elektrogeräte oder heiße herdplatten & # 8211 ; alles gefahrenquellen , an denen man sich verletzen kann .
doch mit ein paar tricks kann man unfälle im haushalt vermeiden .
als häufige gefahrenquellen in haushalten zählen herumliegende gegenstände .
indem man gegenstände nach ihrem gebrauch sofort wieder an ihren platz räumt , sorgt man nicht nur für ordnung , sondern vermindert auch das risiko sich an ihnen zu verletzen .
schnell können herumliegende gegenstände nämlich zu stolperfallen werden .
also alles nach seinem gebrauch wieder weg räumen .
vor allem auf treppen sollte man niemals etwas liegen lassen .
denn gerade hier kommt man leicht ins stolpern und es drohen schwere verletzungen .
was in eine andere etage soll , sollte man lieber gleich dorthin bringen .

new documents suggest fresh evidence of teliasonera ties to karimova azamatjon ermakov used to have a relatively peaceful life ferrying traders and their goods around on his donkey cart in a village in uzbekistan ’ s andijan province .
he had embraced islam in 1995 and became a regular at the local mosque .
in the heart of the ferghana valley , the melting of the winter snows heralds more than the coming of spring -- it 's the beginning of " cocoon season . "
from the end of april to late may , local farmers tend to one of uzbekistan 's proudest industries the old-fashioned way : one silkworm at a time , in the warmth of their own homes .

phillips is player of the year ; abderhalden is coach of the year three players on chemeketa ’ s men ’ s team and two players on the storm women ’ s were named to the nwacc all-league team for the south region .
coach david abderhalden also was named the coach of the year in the conference .
outside hitter mikayla morgan , outside hitter keri stein , and designated setter jourdan wenzinger ( volleyball ) ; “ we wanted to … establish where we are now on how the classroom recycling was going , see what kind of things were still going into the trash , and what changes we can make to accommodate so we can get [ the college ’ s ] trash down to as low as possible . ”
“ we put on gloves , we dig through it ; it ’ s kind of gross , but it doesn ’ t take a long time , and it ’ s kind of fun and interesting , ” fregosi said , explaining what is involved with volunteering for an audit .
“ we knew we had to make adjustments in game two because we did not hit the ball well at all in the first game . ”
bowman then scored on a rbi groundout to second , putting the storm up 3-0 .
hotaling gave up a run in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch but was able to limit the damage .
hotaling mowed down the lower columbia hitters in the fourth and the fifth innings .
she faced a little bit of trouble in the sixth when she gave up two runs on three hits , but she was able to strike out a pinch hitter with runners on second and third to end the inning .
hotaling was able to shut down lower columbia ’ s top-of-the-order hitters in order in the bottom of the seventh to seal the victory .
even though the storm dropped two in a row on saturday to mt .
hood , the team is still in the playoff hunt .
chemeketa has a gem tucked away on the east side of campus .
from a distance , you can & # 8217 ; t see anything more than a few greenhouses and some plants .
up close , however , there is a passion for plants – and from now until mid-june , students , staff , and the community are able to partake in thehorticulture program ’ s plant sale .
the greenhouses are located between the red and brown parking lots on the east side of campus .
one of those students is brianna lucas . she has attended chemeketa for two and a half years and recently graduated from the program .
lucas now is working on flowers in the floriculture program .
she said that she liked being around the plants and wantedto possibly one day own a flower shop .
christeena deroo is currently one of three employees at the greenhouses .
she was the first graduate from thehorticulture program nearly three years ago and wanted to stay involved on campus .
deroo knows all about the greenhouses and what it takes to educate students thoroughly .
“ we have a diverse system in our greenhouses , ” she said .
“ students get to see so many set-ups ; we have to have a broad range . ”
another officially member of the staff is rozie , a 3-year-old cat who hangs out in the warmth of the greenhouses .
the soft carpet tickles between her toes at the early hours of the morning .
“ depending on the day , my feet hit the floor around 5 : 30 a.m. , ” fay demeyer says .
but demeyer is no one-note wonder .
along with teaching psychology classes at chemeketa on tuesdays and thursdays , she also : teaches for the university of phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays ; demeyer also serves as the chairman of the march of dimes foundation and is currently working on two projects for the organization : bowties for babies and high hopes .
“ when i get home , i organize my planner and my clothes for the next day , ” she says , ensuring that her outfits are appropriate for what ’ s ahead .
“ throughout my life , i have overcome a lot .
i came out of foster care and was illiterate until my mid-teens , ” she says .
the craziness of her schedule doesn ’ t affect what happens in her classes , however .
but balance is important to her as well .
that shows up in her social life .
“ i love riding my motorcycle with my husband , phil , and being together .
we ’ ve ran half-marathons , and we ’ re always working on how we can improve our businesses , ” she says .
she even has time for barbecues and spending time with her granddaughter , madi , who is 4 .
“ work to me is not eight hours a day , ” she says .
“ it ’ s from the moment i wake up till the moment my head hits the pillow .
i was raised as a migrant worker and was used to working long hours with no sleep . ”
“ i am always looking for resources to make my life easier .
i drink lots of mountain dew and have low carb protein bars throughout the day .
i save my big meal for when i get home so i can eat with my husband , ” she says .
“ the way i look at it , you have the days you have , so what are you going to do with them ? ”
“ i usually have 30 to 45 minutes of quiet time to reflect on myself .
what do i want to present ?
what are my goals ?
is what i am teaching going to move me closer or further away to those goals ? ”
her dreams keep her occupied for a time before she drifts off to sleep , she says .
but the sound of the alarm clock arrives quickly , and once again her feet slide off the bed and she races off to yet another busy day .
come for the wine , but stay for the education you have been cordially invited to a learning event the northwest viticulture center in the eola hills in west salem is a largely unknown entity of chemeketa .
“ it was one of the nicer days we had had in a while , so the backdoor was opened up to the vineyard just beyond , and this gorgeous jazz was playing throughout the sound system .
“ as i walked by and saw all this , i thought , ‘ you know , if any prospective student could be standing here , looking at this scene , just taking it all in , they would sign-up on the spot ’ – it was so evocative and inviting . ”
and although he ’ s new to the viticulture center , adams says the eola campus is an outstanding place for a person to need to travel to each day .
“ and then you learn how to make wine on top of it .
why not ? ” he says .
the driveway to the campus does a splendid job of preparing visitors for the beauty awaiting them at the top of the hill .
the patio on the backside of bldg. 1 overlooks those 8 acres , as well as the willamette river and the grassy willamette valley below .
at eola , macdonald says , “ we take it from the grape , to the wine , to the sales . ”
“ it just opens up a lot more doors for people . ”
“ i don ’ t know of any of our students who have gone through the whole program that haven ’ t gone out and been able to find a job in the wine world , ” watson says .
the repercussion of these programs on the wine economy , and within the wine industry , is profound .
cortell says that between osu and eola , there has been “ quite a few years of adding a lot of educational value that helps raise the bar and the quality and the status of oregon wines .
“ we ’ ve had a lot of good students come through .
and those of us on the faculty – we ’ ve also worked in the industry , so we come with a lot of industry experience .
“ i lost my job in 2011 , ” fischer says , “ and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to re-examine my life – to think about what my next step was going to be .
for a student or career-minded individual who has a passion for wine , and also may be looking for an employment opportunity within a thriving business economy , eola stands as an excellent option .
“ late in the evening , ” adams says , “ looking out over the vineyard at the sun just beginning to set in the west – amazing . ”
“ if there is nothing else you walk a way with from this class and trip , it & # 8217 ; s that i can make a difference . there is a lot of pride of indigenous community , and if you are a photographer you should bring a camera . it is beautiful ! ”
the questions : how would you feel about a tuition increase ?
and if tuition is raised , where do you want the money to go ?
“ but students are still not rising to the challenge , ” he said .
“ as students , our job is to inform the decision-making process of the administration , ” he said .
“ if no one steps up to voice their opinion , then [ the administration ] is just going to go on whatever they think is best . ”
“ quite honestly , ” cutz said , “ i believe the decision was already made .
the asc represented students , but i don & # 8217 ; t believe it was as big a factor in the board & # 8217 ; s decision-making process as we would have liked it to have been . ”
“ i think accessibility is going to be tough , ” she said .
the views expressed in the courier online edition are not necessarily those of the college or the administration .
