this incident was not the only incident that ’ s occurred when a human perhaps forgets that a species is wild .
some believe it may be a ‘ chuck norris ’ attempt by animal experts to see if they can survive what most can not .
but the wild part of the phrase ‘ wild animal ’ needs to be remembered at all times & # 8211 ; from fishing in the deep to sitting in a tree stand in the woods .
the repellent is the key factor when it comes to the outstanding ability of thermacell , seeing as that it ’ s a copy of the natural repellent created by chrysanthemum flowers .
any outdoor activity can now be fun and worry-free .
from fishing to camping to hunting to backyard activities , thermacell has finally proven there is a way to repel pests and enjoy life ! the milk carton birdfeeder : this one is a classic , but you can actually add a very cute “ bark ” cover that will also help your birdfeeder last longer .
take a milk carton , and cover it with pieces of duct tape , to give that “ bark ” look .
staple the top shut , cut holes at each of the sides , and slide a dowel thru the carton , so the birds to perch .
cut drainage holes in the bottom of the carton .
make sure you put in small holes at the top of the carton , so the birds can enter the feeder , but too small for squirrels .
the egg carton birdfeeder : this is perfect for small children , because it is so easy !
simply cut off the lid of a cardboard egg carton , put a small hole in all four corners of the egg carton , and put string thru the holes . * when filled , the cups tend to be heavy , so tie to strong branches of a bush or tree .
so get started .
the challenges that await you in the woods are long and difficult , but that survivalist vacation may just be the biggest thrill of your life !
swearing each other to secrecy , the malcontents hatch an impromptu plan to live off the land .
and they are joined in the clandestine endeavor by classmate biaggio ( moises arias ) , a mysterious weirdo wiling to tag along and utter an occasional , odd non sequitur .
at heart , the movie is about the intrepid trio ’ s struggle to survive while eluding the frantic search party .
the plot thickens upon the sudden arrival of kelly ( erin moriarty ) at the lad ’ s lair , a cutie pie joe ’ s interested in dating .
will the fetching femme fatale prove to be the boys ’ undoing ?
or will their bond remain intact ?
no spoilers here .

a few years later she got married to howard riley and learned how to hunt , fish , camp and ride horses . she worked in the hay fields mowing hay all day , and as the years went by , she graduated to cooking three meals a day for the hay crew .
on april 16 , 1949 , in ontario , she and howard had a baby girl named sally susanne .
the little girl was the apple of the family ’ s ’ eye because she was the only grandchild for the first 10 years .
living in drewsey then , marge worked in her flower garden and worked in the fields and cooked when she had to .
she taught herself to do leather craft and started a 4-h club , and as the years went by , she taught 4-h leather craft , sheep , and horse for 28 years .
she even had a taxidermy class .
she was a member of the home extension club , too .

it turned out to be a private business for basically 13 years and kept him plenty busy .

he was appalled that the imf was now trying dissociate itself from the programme , while dishing the dirt on the commission .

the rest of the world should be under no illusion about the german elections .

blackjack är ett populärt spel som har sina rötter i kortspelet 21 , ett hasardspel som spelats i flera hundra år i europa .
oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

as of december he is almost three years sober .
as of the end of january 2010 , rex has nearly fully recuperated from his fight with pancreatitis . ^ biography for rex brown at the internet movie database ^ a b pantera ’ s rex brown digs in with down diary of a mad band : europe in the year of vi gheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at the royal opera house as zerlina in don giovanni . [ 4 ] she debuted at the vienna state opera as adina in l 'elisir d 'amore and at the metropolitan opera as mimì in la bohème . [ 5 ] in 1994 , she was auditioned by the conductor sir georg solti for a new production of la traviata at the royal opera house .
her debut as violetta led her to international stardom .
she has recorded many recital albums and complete opera recordings and often appears on television and in concerts .
the emi recording of massenet 's manon with gheorghiu in the title role won the 2001 gramophone award for " best opera recording " , was nominated for " best opera recording " in the 2002 grammy awards . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the emi recording of puccini 's tosca with gheorghiu , roberto alagna and ruggero raimondi in the title roles brought her the deutscher schallplattenpreis award in 2002 . [ 15 ] she also won diapason d 'or awards , choc du monde de la musique in france , cecilia prize in belgium , the echo award , the italian musica e dischi , foreign lyric production award , the usa critics ' award .
gheorghiu won the title of female artist of the year at the classic brit awards in 2001 and 2010 . [ 16 ] she was honoured with " la medaille vermeille de la ville de paris " and she was appointed an officier de l 'ordre des arts et des lettres and chevalier de l 'ordre des arts et lettres by the french ministry of culture and by her native country romania . [ citation needed ] in december 2010 , gheorghiu was awarded a doctor honoris causa by the university of arts in iasi ( romania ) [ 17 ] and the star of romania , the highest decoration given by the president of romania . [ 18 ] " because i grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion , it makes me stronger now .
lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out .
but i have the courage to be , in a way , revolutionary .
i want to fight for opera , for it to be taken seriously .
pop music is for the body , but opera is for the soul . " . [ 20 ] gheorghiu had a problematic relationship with former metropolitan opera general manager joseph volpe after her debut there as mimì in 1993 .
in 1996 , gheorghiu was cast as micaela in a new production of carmen , opposite waltraud meier and plácido domingo .
the production by franco zeffirelli called for micaela to wear a blonde wig , which gheorghiu disliked .
when the met toured the production in japan in 1997 , she refused to wear it on the first night to which volpe famously declared , " the wig is going on , with you or without you " and replaced her with an understudy . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] she appeared at the met again in 1998 for six performances of roméo et juliette with her husband , tenor roberto alagna as roméo .
volpe had planned to engage gheorghiu in violetta valery for a new production of la traviata , to premiere in november 1998 and directed by zeffirelli .
alagna was to sing the role of violetta 's lover , alfredo germont .
according to volpe , gheorghiu and alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract .
they eventually signed their contracts , and faxed them to the met one day past their deadline .
volpe refused to accept them .
the production opened with patricia racette and marcelo álvarez as the lovers . [ 21 ] in september 2007 , gheorghiu was dismissed from lyric opera of chicago 's production of la bohème by general manager william mason , for missing rehearsals and costume fittings , and generally " unprofessional " behavior .
gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband , who was singing at the met in roméo et juliette and rehearsing for puccini 's madama butterfly and added " i have sung ' boheme ' hundreds of times , and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn 't be a tragedy .
it was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time i was in new york . [ 23 ] " when the curtain opened on la rondine at covent garden , the audience gasped and applauded .
people want to dream .
if directors want to do something new with operas , why not do something beautiful ? " [ 26 ] despite these issues , gheorghiu and alagna returned to the metropolitan opera for five performances of l 'elisir d 'amore in 1999 and for four performances of faust in 2003 .

la bienestar del huron es uno de los factores mas sobresalientes a la hora de de comprar una jaulas de hurones .
es verdad que los hurones pasan mucho tiempo afuera de sus jaulas jugando , pero tienes que considerar que no podras custodiar de el todo el dia .
habra momentos en los que tendra que hacer algo mas que velar por su mascota .
cuando estas lejos , es importante para preservar el interior de la jaula huron .
es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .
vitalin o vitalin ferret es un alimento muy balanciado y difinitivamente para recomendar .
todo lo que usted quiere conocer sobre jaulas de hamsters antes de obtener un hamster consigua una jaula para hamsters a prueba de fugas , sencillo de limpiar y lo suficientemente amplia . si bien las jaulas modulares con los tubos son divertidos , pueden ser dificiles de limpiar y pobres en la ventilacion ( y los tubos pueden ser demasiado pequeñas para algunos hamsters sirios ) . es inceible la capacidad de un hamster para escapar de la jaula , son capaces de masticar paredes de plastico de forma sorprendentemente rapida ademas de pasar por espacios muy pequeños .
hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

¿ que variedad de comida deberia comer un pajaro segun su especie ?
las aves requieren una dieta equilibrada con mucha variedad de indicados tipos de alimentos que poseen vitaminas y minerales necesarios .
usted debe garantizar de no ofrecerle a las aves nueces o semillas , sino que se le debe ofrecer comida para pajaros con gran valor nutricional .
al momento de la eleccion de la comida , las aves son dificiles ya que prefieren los frutos de cascara y las semillas en vez de los alimentos sutanciosos .
¿ que debe usted conocer a la hora de elegir la comida para los periquitos ?
siempre y cuando su perico tenga cariño , buena comida y los cuidados apropiados , se va a transformar en uno de los preferidos amigos en su hogar .
siempre que la dieta no sea unicamente de semillas sera buena para los pericos .
que su periquito ingiera semillas todos los dias es comparable a que usted coma carne en todas las comidas , esto no es saludable a largo plazo .
principalmente deben comer pienso y los demas dias pueden comer una diversidad de alimentos frescos .
abrir la heladera o buscar en los gabinetes de cocina : asi de facil sera hacer la comida para periquitos .
en la comida para agapornis prevalecen las frutas , granos y semillas .
al igual que a los loros , a los agapornis en cautiverio se los tiene que alimentar con una dieta similar .
una buena comida para agapornis formulada en forma de granulos conforman la base de su dieta .
al ser tan altas en grasas , las semillas no deben ser mas del 25 % de su dieta , por mas que les fascinen. tambien se aconseja ofrecer al ave gran variedad de frutas frescas y hortalizas .
son muchos los frutos que les encantan , como por ejemplo , las bayas , los melocotones , los platanos , las uvas , naranjas , manzanas y el melon siempre que no tenga cascara .
la comida para canarios esta basada en semillas .
una mezcla de vitaminas y minerales es la ideal dieta para un canario .
que el canario se nutra principalmente con una dieta de semillas primas , ya sea con un alimento de huevo de abba , cede , quiko , orlux o higgins de calidad , es lo aconsejado para el propietario del canario domestico tipico .
otra excelente opcion es una dieta granulada que proporciona alimentos sustanciosos en cada bocado .
¿ que se aconseja al momento de seleccionar la comida para los loros ?
se recomienda una comida para loros que incluya una gran diversidad de alimentos nutritivos recien elaborados , un bajo porcentaje de semillas y una dieta formulada ( piensos ) , tenendo en cuenta los requerimientos nutricionales de las aves .
recuerde que la mayoria de las comidas recien preparadas se descomponen rapidamente y tienen que ser separados de la jaula despues de un par de horas .
si el ave no es facil aprobar los nuevos alimentos , trate de invitarles temprano en la mañana o por la noche , ocasiones en aves que viven en su habitat en busca de alimento en la naturaleza .

new documents suggest fresh evidence of teliasonera ties to karimova azamatjon ermakov used to have a relatively peaceful life ferrying traders and their goods around on his donkey cart in a village in uzbekistan ’ s andijan province .
he had embraced islam in 1995 and became a regular at the local mosque .
in the heart of the ferghana valley , the melting of the winter snows heralds more than the coming of spring -- it 's the beginning of " cocoon season . "
from the end of april to late may , local farmers tend to one of uzbekistan 's proudest industries the old-fashioned way : one silkworm at a time , in the warmth of their own homes .
when you look for heroes , you don ’ t think about looking at the staff of a school , but the principals at mize attendance center and the teachers acted both bravely and efficiently on thursday mornin ...

magonlia state bank to host 5k run / walk and fun run on may 29 , chemeketa officials visited garmin at in salem to offer a thank-you gift .
phillips is player of the year ; abderhalden is coach of the year three players on chemeketa ’ s men ’ s team and two players on the storm women ’ s were named to the nwacc all-league team for the south region .
coach david abderhalden also was named the coach of the year in the conference .
outside hitter mikayla morgan , outside hitter keri stein , and designated setter jourdan wenzinger ( volleyball ) ; “ we wanted to … establish where we are now on how the classroom recycling was going , see what kind of things were still going into the trash , and what changes we can make to accommodate so we can get [ the college ’ s ] trash down to as low as possible . ”
“ we put on gloves , we dig through it ; it ’ s kind of gross , but it doesn ’ t take a long time , and it ’ s kind of fun and interesting , ” fregosi said , explaining what is involved with volunteering for an audit .
“ we knew we had to make adjustments in game two because we did not hit the ball well at all in the first game . ”
bowman then scored on a rbi groundout to second , putting the storm up 3-0 .
hotaling gave up a run in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch but was able to limit the damage .
hotaling mowed down the lower columbia hitters in the fourth and the fifth innings .
she faced a little bit of trouble in the sixth when she gave up two runs on three hits , but she was able to strike out a pinch hitter with runners on second and third to end the inning .
hotaling was able to shut down lower columbia ’ s top-of-the-order hitters in order in the bottom of the seventh to seal the victory .
even though the storm dropped two in a row on saturday to mt .
hood , the team is still in the playoff hunt .
chemeketa has a gem tucked away on the east side of campus .
from a distance , you can & # 8217 ; t see anything more than a few greenhouses and some plants .
up close , however , there is a passion for plants – and from now until mid-june , students , staff , and the community are able to partake in thehorticulture program ’ s plant sale .
the greenhouses are located between the red and brown parking lots on the east side of campus .
one of those students is brianna lucas . she has attended chemeketa for two and a half years and recently graduated from the program .
lucas now is working on flowers in the floriculture program .
she said that she liked being around the plants and wantedto possibly one day own a flower shop .
christeena deroo is currently one of three employees at the greenhouses .
she was the first graduate from thehorticulture program nearly three years ago and wanted to stay involved on campus .
deroo knows all about the greenhouses and what it takes to educate students thoroughly .
“ we have a diverse system in our greenhouses , ” she said .
“ students get to see so many set-ups ; we have to have a broad range . ”
another officially member of the staff is rozie , a 3-year-old cat who hangs out in the warmth of the greenhouses .
the soft carpet tickles between her toes at the early hours of the morning .
“ depending on the day , my feet hit the floor around 5 : 30 a.m. , ” fay demeyer says .
but demeyer is no one-note wonder .
along with teaching psychology classes at chemeketa on tuesdays and thursdays , she also : teaches for the university of phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays ; demeyer also serves as the chairman of the march of dimes foundation and is currently working on two projects for the organization : bowties for babies and high hopes .
“ when i get home , i organize my planner and my clothes for the next day , ” she says , ensuring that her outfits are appropriate for what ’ s ahead .
“ throughout my life , i have overcome a lot .
i came out of foster care and was illiterate until my mid-teens , ” she says .
the craziness of her schedule doesn ’ t affect what happens in her classes , however .
but balance is important to her as well .
that shows up in her social life .
“ i love riding my motorcycle with my husband , phil , and being together .
we ’ ve ran half-marathons , and we ’ re always working on how we can improve our businesses , ” she says .
she even has time for barbecues and spending time with her granddaughter , madi , who is 4 .
“ work to me is not eight hours a day , ” she says .
“ it ’ s from the moment i wake up till the moment my head hits the pillow .
i was raised as a migrant worker and was used to working long hours with no sleep . ”
“ i am always looking for resources to make my life easier .
i drink lots of mountain dew and have low carb protein bars throughout the day .
i save my big meal for when i get home so i can eat with my husband , ” she says .
“ the way i look at it , you have the days you have , so what are you going to do with them ? ”
“ i usually have 30 to 45 minutes of quiet time to reflect on myself .
what do i want to present ?
what are my goals ?
is what i am teaching going to move me closer or further away to those goals ? ”
her dreams keep her occupied for a time before she drifts off to sleep , she says .
but the sound of the alarm clock arrives quickly , and once again her feet slide off the bed and she races off to yet another busy day .
come for the wine , but stay for the education you have been cordially invited to a learning event the northwest viticulture center in the eola hills in west salem is a largely unknown entity of chemeketa .
“ it was one of the nicer days we had had in a while , so the backdoor was opened up to the vineyard just beyond , and this gorgeous jazz was playing throughout the sound system .
“ as i walked by and saw all this , i thought , ‘ you know , if any prospective student could be standing here , looking at this scene , just taking it all in , they would sign-up on the spot ’ – it was so evocative and inviting . ”
and although he ’ s new to the viticulture center , adams says the eola campus is an outstanding place for a person to need to travel to each day .
“ and then you learn how to make wine on top of it .
why not ? ” he says .
the driveway to the campus does a splendid job of preparing visitors for the beauty awaiting them at the top of the hill .
the patio on the backside of bldg. 1 overlooks those 8 acres , as well as the willamette river and the grassy willamette valley below .
at eola , macdonald says , “ we take it from the grape , to the wine , to the sales . ”
“ it just opens up a lot more doors for people . ”
“ i don ’ t know of any of our students who have gone through the whole program that haven ’ t gone out and been able to find a job in the wine world , ” watson says .
the repercussion of these programs on the wine economy , and within the wine industry , is profound .
cortell says that between osu and eola , there has been “ quite a few years of adding a lot of educational value that helps raise the bar and the quality and the status of oregon wines .
“ we ’ ve had a lot of good students come through .
and those of us on the faculty – we ’ ve also worked in the industry , so we come with a lot of industry experience .
“ i lost my job in 2011 , ” fischer says , “ and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to re-examine my life – to think about what my next step was going to be .
for a student or career-minded individual who has a passion for wine , and also may be looking for an employment opportunity within a thriving business economy , eola stands as an excellent option .
“ late in the evening , ” adams says , “ looking out over the vineyard at the sun just beginning to set in the west – amazing . ”
“ if there is nothing else you walk a way with from this class and trip , it & # 8217 ; s that i can make a difference . there is a lot of pride of indigenous community , and if you are a photographer you should bring a camera . it is beautiful ! ”
the questions : how would you feel about a tuition increase ?
and if tuition is raised , where do you want the money to go ?
“ but students are still not rising to the challenge , ” he said .
“ as students , our job is to inform the decision-making process of the administration , ” he said .
“ if no one steps up to voice their opinion , then [ the administration ] is just going to go on whatever they think is best . ”
“ quite honestly , ” cutz said , “ i believe the decision was already made .
the asc represented students , but i don & # 8217 ; t believe it was as big a factor in the board & # 8217 ; s decision-making process as we would have liked it to have been . ”
“ i think accessibility is going to be tough , ” she said .
the views expressed in the courier online edition are not necessarily those of the college or the administration .
