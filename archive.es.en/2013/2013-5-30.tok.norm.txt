blackjack är ett populärt spel som har sina rötter i kortspelet 21 , ett hasardspel som spelats i flera hundra år i europa .
oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .
blackjack cardcounting ( korträkning ) har existerat länge , men fick större spridning efter att casinoägaren harold smith publicerade boken ” i want to quit winners ” år 1961 och den amerikanske matematikern dr. edward o. thorp publicerade sin bok ” beat the dealer ” år 1962 .

he ’ s gaining a little weight back .
rex is one of my best friends in the world .
i love him to death .
he ’ ll be all right .
everybody ’ s not lemmy ( from motörhead ) .
i tell him that sometimes .
it got to the point where his body just started giving out from 25 years on the road – drinking every day and what not .
most people do it on the weekend .
add that up to every day for 25 years and that ’ s what happens .
by no means is he out of the band . "
as of december he is almost three years sober .
as of the end of january 2010 , rex has nearly fully recuperated from his fight with pancreatitis . ^ biography for rex brown at the internet movie database ^ a b pantera ’ s rex brown digs in with down diary of a mad band : europe in the year of vi gheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at the royal opera house as zerlina in don giovanni . [ 4 ] she debuted at the vienna state opera as adina in l 'elisir d 'amore and at the metropolitan opera as mimì in la bohème . [ 5 ] in 1994 , she was auditioned by the conductor sir georg solti for a new production of la traviata at the royal opera house .
her debut as violetta led her to international stardom .
she has recorded many recital albums and complete opera recordings and often appears on television and in concerts .
the emi recording of massenet 's manon with gheorghiu in the title role won the 2001 gramophone award for " best opera recording " , was nominated for " best opera recording " in the 2002 grammy awards . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the emi recording of puccini 's tosca with gheorghiu , roberto alagna and ruggero raimondi in the title roles brought her the deutscher schallplattenpreis award in 2002 . [ 15 ] she also won diapason d 'or awards , choc du monde de la musique in france , cecilia prize in belgium , the echo award , the italian musica e dischi , foreign lyric production award , the usa critics ' award .
gheorghiu won the title of female artist of the year at the classic brit awards in 2001 and 2010 . [ 16 ] she was honoured with " la medaille vermeille de la ville de paris " and she was appointed an officier de l 'ordre des arts et des lettres and chevalier de l 'ordre des arts et lettres by the french ministry of culture and by her native country romania . [ citation needed ] in december 2010 , gheorghiu was awarded a doctor honoris causa by the university of arts in iasi ( romania ) [ 17 ] and the star of romania , the highest decoration given by the president of romania . [ 18 ] " because i grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion , it makes me stronger now .
lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out .
but i have the courage to be , in a way , revolutionary .
i want to fight for opera , for it to be taken seriously .
pop music is for the body , but opera is for the soul . " . [ 20 ] gheorghiu had a problematic relationship with former metropolitan opera general manager joseph volpe after her debut there as mimì in 1993 .
in 1996 , gheorghiu was cast as micaela in a new production of carmen , opposite waltraud meier and plácido domingo .
the production by franco zeffirelli called for micaela to wear a blonde wig , which gheorghiu disliked .
when the met toured the production in japan in 1997 , she refused to wear it on the first night to which volpe famously declared , " the wig is going on , with you or without you " and replaced her with an understudy . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] she appeared at the met again in 1998 for six performances of roméo et juliette with her husband , tenor roberto alagna as roméo .
volpe had planned to engage gheorghiu in violetta valery for a new production of la traviata , to premiere in november 1998 and directed by zeffirelli .
alagna was to sing the role of violetta 's lover , alfredo germont .
according to volpe , gheorghiu and alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract .
they eventually signed their contracts , and faxed them to the met one day past their deadline .
volpe refused to accept them .
the production opened with patricia racette and marcelo álvarez as the lovers . [ 21 ] in september 2007 , gheorghiu was dismissed from lyric opera of chicago 's production of la bohème by general manager william mason , for missing rehearsals and costume fittings , and generally " unprofessional " behavior .
gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband , who was singing at the met in roméo et juliette and rehearsing for puccini 's madama butterfly and added " i have sung ' boheme ' hundreds of times , and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn 't be a tragedy .
it was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time i was in new york . [ 23 ] " when the curtain opened on la rondine at covent garden , the audience gasped and applauded .
people want to dream .
if directors want to do something new with operas , why not do something beautiful ? " [ 26 ] despite these issues , gheorghiu and alagna returned to the metropolitan opera for five performances of l 'elisir d 'amore in 1999 and for four performances of faust in 2003 .
gheorghiu also performed at the met as liù in turandot in 2000 ; as violetta in la traviata opposite jonas kaufmann in 2006 and 2007 ; as amelia in simon boccanegra in 2007 ; as mimì in la bohème in 2008 ; as magda in the 2008 / 09 season in the roh / sfo production of la rondine , the met 's first performance of the opera since 1936 ; and for the 2009 / 10 season she appeared as violetta , replacing her previous engagement as marie antoinette in a rare revival of john corigliano 's the ghosts of versailles which was replaced due to the recession . ^ monitorul oficial , decretul 921 din 27 septembrie 2010 privind conferirea ordinului national steaua romaniei in grad de comandor ^ " que quiere expresar sus fantasías , olvidándose de los personajes .

jefferson county may be getting into the wood-chipping business by way of its solid waste department .
or so it was suggested on tuesday morning , may 7 , when the jefferson county commission granted the department ’ s request to purchase a demo wood chipper for roughly $ 39,000 .
county coordinator parrish barwick made the arguments for the purchase of the equipment .
barwick pointed out that presently , wood debris must be hauled to the closed landfill off tyson road .
and periodically , the county brings in a private company to chip the wood .
but now , barwick said , the private company wanted to charge the county for the service .
he credited solid waste department director beth letchworth with coming up with the idea .
a wood chipper , barwick said , would eliminate the need for the long hauls that the department now had to make to transport the wood debris and tree limbs to the landfill .
instead , the department could haul the chipper to the site of the fallen tree , chip it and disperse of the byproduct by the roadside , he said .
or the woodchip could be stockpiled on the grounds of the extension office or elsewhere and made available for free to the public for landscaping and gardening purposes , barwick suggested .
he posited that over time the county could recoup much of the cost of the chipper in saved gasoline and reduced tipping fees at the regional landfill .
“ we ’ ll save half of that over the year , ” barwick said of the equipment ’ s cost .
“ we ’ ll save in manpower having to haul the debris to the landfill and in not having to pay the company to chip it .
and we ’ ll save by keeping a thousand pounds of debris from the landfill . ”
the chipper , he said , would process trees with diameters of up to 20 inches .

sicherheitsschuhe sind stiefel oder halbschuhe , welche zum schutz getragen werden .
sie werden oft auch von beispielsweise berufsgenossenschaften vorgeschrieben .

der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .

la bienestar del huron es uno de los factores mas sobresalientes a la hora de de comprar una jaulas de hurones .
es verdad que los hurones pasan mucho tiempo afuera de sus jaulas jugando , pero tienes que considerar que no podras custodiar de el todo el dia .
habra momentos en los que tendra que hacer algo mas que velar por su mascota .
cuando estas lejos , es importante para preservar el interior de la jaula huron .
es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .

todo lo que usted quiere conocer sobre jaulas de hamsters antes de obtener un hamster consigua una jaula para hamsters a prueba de fugas , sencillo de limpiar y lo suficientemente amplia . si bien las jaulas modulares con los tubos son divertidos , pueden ser dificiles de limpiar y pobres en la ventilacion ( y los tubos pueden ser demasiado pequeñas para algunos hamsters sirios ) . es inceible la capacidad de un hamster para escapar de la jaula , son capaces de masticar paredes de plastico de forma sorprendentemente rapida ademas de pasar por espacios muy pequeños .
hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

la comida para canarios esta basada en semillas .
una mezcla de vitaminas y minerales es la ideal dieta para un canario .
que el canario se nutra principalmente con una dieta de semillas primas , ya sea con un alimento de huevo de abba , cede , quiko , orlux o higgins de calidad , es lo aconsejado para el propietario del canario domestico tipico .

relatively peaceful life ferrying traders and their goods around on his donkey cart in a village in uzbekistan ’ s andijan province .
he had embraced islam in 1995 and became a regular at the local mosque .
in the heart of the ferghana valley , the melting of the winter snows heralds more than the coming of spring -- it 's the beginning of " cocoon season . "
from the end of april to late may , local farmers tend to one of uzbekistan 's proudest industries the old-fashioned way : one silkworm at a time , in the warmth of their own homes .
when you look for heroes , you don ’ t think about looking at the staff of a school , but the principals at mize attendance center and the teachers acted both bravely and efficiently on thursday mornin ...

magonlia state bank to host 5k run / walk and fun run top newsopinionnews of the weirdhealthy livingpet talesbusiness & real estate “ we wanted to … establish where we are now on how the classroom recycling was going , see what kind of things were still going into the trash , and what changes we can make to accommodate so we can get [ the college ’ s ] trash down to as low as possible . ”
“ we put on gloves , we dig through it ; it ’ s kind of gross , but it doesn ’ t take a long time , and it ’ s kind of fun and interesting , ” fregosi said , explaining what is involved with volunteering for an audit .
“ we knew we had to make adjustments in game two because we did not hit the ball well at all in the first game . ”
bowman then scored on a rbi groundout to second , putting the storm up 3-0 .
hotaling gave up a run in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch but was able to limit the damage .
hotaling mowed down the lower columbia hitters in the fourth and the fifth innings .
she faced a little bit of trouble in the sixth when she gave up two runs on three hits , but she was able to strike out a pinch hitter with runners on second and third to end the inning .
hotaling was able to shut down lower columbia ’ s top-of-the-order hitters in order in the bottom of the seventh to seal the victory .
even though the storm dropped two in a row on saturday to mt .
hood , the team is still in the playoff hunt .
chemeketa has a gem tucked away on the east side of campus .
from a distance , you can & # 8217 ; t see anything more than a few greenhouses and some plants .
up close , however , there is a passion for plants – and from now until mid-june , students , staff , and the community are able to partake in thehorticulture program ’ s plant sale .
the greenhouses are located between the red and brown parking lots on the east side of campus .
one of those students is brianna lucas . she has attended chemeketa for two and a half years and recently graduated from the program .
lucas now is working on flowers in the floriculture program .
she said that she liked being around the plants and wantedto possibly one day own a flower shop .
christeena deroo is currently one of three employees at the greenhouses .
she was the first graduate from thehorticulture program nearly three years ago and wanted to stay involved on campus .
deroo knows all about the greenhouses and what it takes to educate students thoroughly .
“ we have a diverse system in our greenhouses , ” she said .
“ students get to see so many set-ups ; we have to have a broad range . ”
another officially member of the staff is rozie , a 3-year-old cat who hangs out in the warmth of the greenhouses .
the soft carpet tickles between her toes at the early hours of the morning .
“ depending on the day , my feet hit the floor around 5 : 30 a.m. , ” fay demeyer says .
but demeyer is no one-note wonder .
along with teaching psychology classes at chemeketa on tuesdays and thursdays , she also : teaches for the university of phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays ; demeyer also serves as the chairman of the march of dimes foundation and is currently working on two projects for the organization : bowties for babies and high hopes .
“ when i get home , i organize my planner and my clothes for the next day , ” she says , ensuring that her outfits are appropriate for what ’ s ahead .
“ throughout my life , i have overcome a lot .
i came out of foster care and was illiterate until my mid-teens , ” she says .
the craziness of her schedule doesn ’ t affect what happens in her classes , however .
but balance is important to her as well .
that shows up in her social life .
“ i love riding my motorcycle with my husband , phil , and being together .
we ’ ve ran half-marathons , and we ’ re always working on how we can improve our businesses , ” she says .
she even has time for barbecues and spending time with her granddaughter , madi , who is 4 .
“ work to me is not eight hours a day , ” she says .
“ it ’ s from the moment i wake up till the moment my head hits the pillow .
i was raised as a migrant worker and was used to working long hours with no sleep . ”
“ i am always looking for resources to make my life easier .
i drink lots of mountain dew and have low carb protein bars throughout the day .
i save my big meal for when i get home so i can eat with my husband , ” she says .
“ the way i look at it , you have the days you have , so what are you going to do with them ? ”
“ i usually have 30 to 45 minutes of quiet time to reflect on myself .
what do i want to present ?
what are my goals ?
is what i am teaching going to move me closer or further away to those goals ? ”
her dreams keep her occupied for a time before she drifts off to sleep , she says .
but the sound of the alarm clock arrives quickly , and once again her feet slide off the bed and she races off to yet another busy day .
come for the wine , but stay for the education you have been cordially invited to a learning event the northwest viticulture center in the eola hills in west salem is a largely unknown entity of chemeketa .
“ it was one of the nicer days we had had in a while , so the backdoor was opened up to the vineyard just beyond , and this gorgeous jazz was playing throughout the sound system .
“ as i walked by and saw all this , i thought , ‘ you know , if any prospective student could be standing here , looking at this scene , just taking it all in , they would sign-up on the spot ’ – it was so evocative and inviting . ”
and although he ’ s new to the viticulture center , adams says the eola campus is an outstanding place for a person to need to travel to each day .
“ and then you learn how to make wine on top of it .
why not ? ” he says .
the driveway to the campus does a splendid job of preparing visitors for the beauty awaiting them at the top of the hill .
the patio on the backside of bldg. 1 overlooks those 8 acres , as well as the willamette river and the grassy willamette valley below .
at eola , macdonald says , “ we take it from the grape , to the wine , to the sales . ”
“ it just opens up a lot more doors for people . ”
“ i don ’ t know of any of our students who have gone through the whole program that haven ’ t gone out and been able to find a job in the wine world , ” watson says .
the repercussion of these programs on the wine economy , and within the wine industry , is profound .
cortell says that between osu and eola , there has been “ quite a few years of adding a lot of educational value that helps raise the bar and the quality and the status of oregon wines .
“ we ’ ve had a lot of good students come through .
and those of us on the faculty – we ’ ve also worked in the industry , so we come with a lot of industry experience .
“ i lost my job in 2011 , ” fischer says , “ and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to re-examine my life – to think about what my next step was going to be .
for a student or career-minded individual who has a passion for wine , and also may be looking for an employment opportunity within a thriving business economy , eola stands as an excellent option .
“ late in the evening , ” adams says , “ looking out over the vineyard at the sun just beginning to set in the west – amazing . ”
“ if there is nothing else you walk a way with from this class and trip , it & # 8217 ; s that i can make a difference . there is a lot of pride of indigenous community , and if you are a photographer you should bring a camera . it is beautiful ! ”
the questions : how would you feel about a tuition increase ?
and if tuition is raised , where do you want the money to go ?
“ but students are still not rising to the challenge , ” he said .
“ as students , our job is to inform the decision-making process of the administration , ” he said .
“ if no one steps up to voice their opinion , then [ the administration ] is just going to go on whatever they think is best . ”
“ quite honestly , ” cutz said , “ i believe the decision was already made .
the asc represented students , but i don & # 8217 ; t believe it was as big a factor in the board & # 8217 ; s decision-making process as we would have liked it to have been . ”
“ i think accessibility is going to be tough , ” she said .
even though the storm don ’ t have a shot at making the nwacc playoffs , the team ’ s mentality on the diamond didn ’ t waver .
“ we want to be playing our best baseball at the end of the season , and that is what we have been doing . ”
emerson also retired the first two batters in the top of the third , but clackamas then started a two-out rally on two infield singles , two walks , and a chemeketa error , producing two runs before the storm was able to stop the bleeding .
emerson kept clackamas off the board and off the bases in the top half of the fourth and fifth innings .
emerson did give up a leadoff single in the top of the sixth , but he was able to get the next three batters on groundouts .
munson then stepped to the plate with runners on second and third and two outs .
after working the count to full , he laced the payoff pitch up the middle for a base hit that scored the go-ahead run .
emerson gave up his first earned run of the day in the top of the seventh , but he was able to get out of the inning with limited damage .
he then forced the clackamas nine-hitter to fly out to shallow right field and , thanks to a great throw by mcgraw , the runner on third was unable to tag up and score .
chemeketa got an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth on a bunt hit by schaffer and a single to right-center field by mcgraw . & # 8220 ; unfortunately , the only one we have any control over is the fee we charge for bettering education . & # 8221 ; the views expressed in the courier online edition are not necessarily those of the college or the administration .
