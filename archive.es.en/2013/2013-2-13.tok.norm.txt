6 ) the court decided not to put a one-acre parcel of county-owned land , which it acquired due to tax foreclosure in 2006 , up for auction . grasty then encouraged the court to make a decision regarding the parcel .

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

( continued ) tunesien , das an der nord-östlichen spitze des afrikanischen kontinents liegt , besitzt eine beneidenswerte geografische lage .
es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .
der norden ist einerseits von einer mit pinienwäldern sowie mit eichen bewachsenen bergkette geschmückt , andererseits breiten sich fruchtbare ebenen aus , die zum großteil von zwei wasserläufen , dem qued mejerda und dem qued meliane bewässert werden .
die quelle des ersten liegt in algerien , die des zweiten am jebel bargou in der nähe von siliana .
beide münden in den golf von tunis .
die meisten unfälle passieren nicht im verkehr , sondern zu hause .
denn im haushalt lauern viele gefahren .
herumliegende gegenstände , elektrogeräte oder heiße herdplatten & # 8211 ; alles gefahrenquellen , an denen man sich verletzen kann .
doch mit ein paar tricks kann man unfälle im haushalt vermeiden .
als häufige gefahrenquellen in haushalten zählen herumliegende gegenstände .
indem man gegenstände nach ihrem gebrauch sofort wieder an ihren platz räumt , sorgt man nicht nur für ordnung , sondern vermindert auch das risiko sich an ihnen zu verletzen .
schnell können herumliegende gegenstände nämlich zu stolperfallen werden .
also alles nach seinem gebrauch wieder weg räumen .
vor allem auf treppen sollte man niemals etwas liegen lassen .
denn gerade hier kommt man leicht ins stolpern und es drohen schwere verletzungen .
was in eine andere etage soll , sollte man lieber gleich dorthin bringen .

todo lo que deberia conocer acerca de viviendas para perros es importante tener en cuenta que los perros son animales de habitos al elegir una ubicacion para las camas para perros , su espacio o vivienda .
probablemente , de adulto acabara durmiendo en el lugar en el que vivio de cachorro .
si el perro sera una mascota de interior , seleccione una ubicacion donde no moleste , que sea fresco y este perfectamente ventilado .
si a un cachorro se le permite dormir en la cama del amo , en un futuro se trasnformara en unfastidiosos socio .
si el perro va a vivir al aire libre debe estar refugiados contra el viento y la lluvia por una casa de perro que se puede encontrar en cualquier tienda de perros .
la casa debe tener suficiente espacio como para que el perro quepa de lleno y de una un giro de un circulo completo antes de acostarse .
durante los meses de invierno , una tela gruesa debe ser puesta sobre la puerta para mantener el calor y impedir que el viento y la humedad ingresen .

habra momentos en los que tendra que hacer algo mas que velar por su mascota .
cuando estas lejos , es importante para preservar el interior de la jaula huron .
es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .

hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
lo que tiene que saber para la seleccion de comida para gatos .
nosotros somos lo que comemos , esto es valido también para los gatos que requieren de nosotros en cuanto a albergue y comida .
de hecho , la comida para gatos es lo mas primordial en el cuidado del felino , junto con las visitas a veterinarios .
algo importante a saber es que una correcta comida atrasa las visitas al veterinario asi como una serie de condiciones medicas peligrosas .
antes de seguir hay que cubrir algunos de los conceptos basicos , esto ayudara a lograr el objetivo de este articulo que es simplificarte la seleccion de la comida para gatos , enseñando a leer el rotulo de los piensos para gatos .
lo que tiene que conocer de las necesidades nutricionales esenciales de los gatos .
proteina de la carne , el pescado o aves de corral eso es lo que debe saber basicamente , aunque los gatos no necesitan hidratos de carbono , el maiz , el trigo y / o el arroz se utilizan como material de relleno para los alimentos enlatados y pienso gatos .
otros componentes , tales como aglutinantes , aromatizantes y colorantes , los fabricantes de comida para gato los añaden para satisfacer las exigencias esteticas de los compradores .
la comida enlatada no debe permanecer gran tiempo fuera aunque los preservativos utilizados mantengan los alimentos frescos para nuestros gatos .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

usted debe garantizar de no ofrecerle a las aves nueces o semillas , sino que se le debe ofrecer comida para pajaros con gran valor nutricional .
al momento de la eleccion de la comida , las aves son dificiles ya que prefieren los frutos de cascara y las semillas en vez de los alimentos sutanciosos .
¿ que debe usted conocer a la hora de elegir la comida para los periquitos ?
siempre y cuando su perico tenga cariño , buena comida y los cuidados apropiados , se va a transformar en uno de los preferidos amigos en su hogar .
siempre que la dieta no sea unicamente de semillas sera buena para los pericos .
que su periquito ingiera semillas todos los dias es comparable a que usted coma carne en todas las comidas , esto no es saludable a largo plazo .
principalmente deben comer pienso y los demas dias pueden comer una diversidad de alimentos frescos .
abrir la heladera o buscar en los gabinetes de cocina : asi de facil sera hacer la comida para periquitos .
en la comida para agapornis prevalecen las frutas , granos y semillas .
al igual que a los loros , a los agapornis en cautiverio se los tiene que alimentar con una dieta similar .
una buena comida para agapornis formulada en forma de granulos conforman la base de su dieta .
al ser tan altas en grasas , las semillas no deben ser mas del 25 % de su dieta , por mas que les fascinen. tambien se aconseja ofrecer al ave gran variedad de frutas frescas y hortalizas .
son muchos los frutos que les encantan , como por ejemplo , las bayas , los melocotones , los platanos , las uvas , naranjas , manzanas y el melon siempre que no tenga cascara .
la comida para canarios esta basada en semillas .
una mezcla de vitaminas y minerales es la ideal dieta para un canario .
que el canario se nutra principalmente con una dieta de semillas primas , ya sea con un alimento de huevo de abba , cede , quiko , orlux o higgins de calidad , es lo aconsejado para el propietario del canario domestico tipico .
otra excelente opcion es una dieta granulada que proporciona alimentos sustanciosos en cada bocado .
¿ que se aconseja al momento de seleccionar la comida para los loros ?
se recomienda una comida para loros que incluya una gran diversidad de alimentos nutritivos recien elaborados , un bajo porcentaje de semillas y una dieta formulada ( piensos ) , tenendo en cuenta los requerimientos nutricionales de las aves .
recuerde que la mayoria de las comidas recien preparadas se descomponen rapidamente y tienen que ser separados de la jaula despues de un par de horas .
si el ave no es facil aprobar los nuevos alimentos , trate de invitarles temprano en la mañana o por la noche , ocasiones en aves que viven en su habitat en busca de alimento en la naturaleza .
escoger el tipo de jaula para conejo es muy importante .
las jaulas para conejos que son lo suficientemente amplias , simples de limpiar y comodo para entrar y salir para su conejo , hara que compartir tu hogar con tu conejo mucho mas facil .
una jaula que es lo sobradamente amplia es esencial para el bienestar de su conejo , pero no es un sustituto para el ejercicio y el tiempo de estar fuera de la jaula .
en el mercado hay ofrecidas un millon de jaulas que no son las aconsejadas para los conejos .
algunas son demasiado pequeñas , y muchas tienen pisos de alambre , que puede hacer la limpieza mas sencillo , pero que no brindan mucho consuelo para el conejo .
generalmente , mas grande es mejor .
si su conejo se pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo en una jaula , entonces , es mejor obtener la jaula mas amplia que sea practico en el hogar .
una guia util es calcular el tamaño de la jaula como veces el medida de tu conejo .
para los conejos grandes de mas de 8 kilos se aconseja una jaula de 30 " por 36 " y para los mas chicos una de 24 " por 36 " van bien .
asi mismo las jaulas conejos que tienen pisos y rampas que une a estos niveles suelen agradarles mucho a los conejos .
una de las cosas a remarcar es que la puerta debe ser lo bastante grande como para sacar al conejo y poder limpiar el lecho de arena .
una puerta lateral es posiblemente el mejor , como una primera abertura de la jaula hace que adquirir el conejo y un poco mas dificultoso ( y lo mejor es que el conejo pueda entrar y salir por su cuenta ) .
es vital revisar que la entrada tenga los rebordes lisos o cubiertos de plastico para evitar que el conejo o tu s lastimen .
todo lo que necesitas entender sobre como alimentar a tu conejo un saludable sistema digestivo depende de cuanta fibra su conejo ingiera .
la mayor parte de la dieta de los conejos comesticos consiste en heno de hierba frezca y hortalizas .
las proteinas incluidas en pienso para conejos tienen una alta proporcion en acidos aminados esenciales que son muy vital para el desarrollo de los musculos .
comida conejos asi mismo simplifica en la prevencion de las bolas de pelo .
hay que vigilar la cantidad de heno , veduras y pienso que el conejo consume ya que es muy primordial tener una moderacion en la comida para conejos .

que debo conocer sobre las chinchillas como mascotas y sus mordedores ?
antes de decidirse por una chinchilla como animal domestico , tiene informarse con sus caracteristicas distintivas y todas las facetas para su cuidado .
aqui hallara toda lainformacion y una guia de como tener cuidado una chinchilla , que cuidados debe tener , y cuales son los accesorios inpresindibles para manteneren la casa para una chinchilla .
con un manejo reposado desde una temprana edad la mayoria de las chinchillas se hara muy sumisas y estaran cerca con sus propietarios , aunque a veces no les gusta que se carguen o los abracen .
las chinchillas pueden encontrarse solas o juntas , pero de estar con otra chinchilla es recomendable que sean del mismo sexo , o hermanas o que esten juntas desde una temprana edad .
las chinchillas son muy energicas y vivarachas .
sus habitos son nocturnos , por lo que las chinchillas son mucho mas energicas durante la noche . los picos mas altos de actividad son durante cuando esta amaneciendo o durante el atardecer , por lo que se le suele llamar crepuscular . de todas maneras , deben ponerse en una zona bastante pasificadurante el dia .
los habitosy tener horarios para la alimentacion es muy importante ya que las mismas se estresan si hay cambios en su rutina diaria .
ya que las chinchillas son muy activas y les gusta jugar , necesitan su sitio para realizar ejercicio por lo que la jaulas chinchillas debe ser grande . para las chinchillas provenientes de temperaturas frias se deben tener cuidados de no ubicarlas en lugares muy calidos ya que el exeso de temperaturas les puede perjudicar .
para atesorar a las chinchillas sanas , una buena y euilibrado regimen de calidad es sumamente necesario . su sistema digestivo esta diseniado para comida para chinchillas con mucha fibra , por lo que una buena dieta debe tener mucha fibra y un monton de heno para chinchillas que es una hierba . una dieta inapropiada puede causar graves desordenes estomacales y contratiempo de salud . como algunas personas , las chinchillas tienen un diente dulce y pueden anteponeralimentarse cosas que no son oportunas para ellos por lo que se debe usar con cuidado . las chinchillas requieren una gran cantidad de forraje , y el regimen ante todo debe estar consistido de una hierba de heno de buena calidad , junto con bolitas elaboradas de chinchillas una cucharadita por dia en total . el sistema digestivo de las chinchillas es bastante perceptivo por lo que cualquier modificacion en el regimen debe ser gradual . las hermosas chinchillas tienen un deseo insaciable de roer .
esto se debe a las chinchillas , como todos los roedores , tienen dientes que crecen de forma continuada por la vida .
estos dientes deben ser continuamente desgastado al roer .
asegúrese de que hay un montón de mordedores para chinchilla .
al ser mascotas activos , las chinchillas requieren una jaula para chinchillas extensa , espaciosa , ideal con multiples pisos . lo ideal es que haya una jaula configurado y listo antes de transladar su casa chinchilla , para hacer la cambio a su casa mucho mas facil . ademas de la jaula , tendra accesorios , incluyendo una caja nido , botella de agua , banio de polvo , y algunos juguetes para masticar .
el bano de polvo solo debe ponerse a disposicion de la chinchilla de forma alternadamente para que la misma pueda preservar su gruesa piel en forma optima.tenga en cuenta que no es recomendable proveer un bano de agua a una chinchilla esto no solo ayudara a revolcarse en el polvo para concervar su piel tersa y sedosa de espesor , que se cree que es relajante y divertido para chinchillas . otros polvos o granos de arena pueden verse o sentirse similar , pero no va a desempenarse de la igual forma - el polvo de chinchilla se hace para imitar lo que se tiene acceso en su habitat natural .
