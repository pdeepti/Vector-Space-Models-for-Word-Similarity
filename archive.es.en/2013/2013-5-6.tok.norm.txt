located on the first floor of vero beach hotel and spa to see a videos of kevin costner & # 038 ; modern west : sometimes presidential candidates engage in hyperbole to make their point , but romney is spot on in his assessment of newt gingrich .
the former speaker of the house is a hapless buffoon , a fraud , and a disgrace to humankind .
he was a leader for four years as speaker of the house .
and at the end of four years , it was proven that he was a failed leader and he had to resign in disgrace .
i don 't know whether you knew that , he actually resigned after four years , in disgrace .
when facing a huge bully you don 't slap him on the face , that 's not going to knock him down .
you pick up a two-by-four and hit him upside the head .
romney needs to pick up gingrich 's heavy baggage and clobber him senseless .
rick santorum and ron paul would be advised to do the same , hit gingrich hard and often .
it would be a disaster for the gop and our democratic process if a thug like gingrich wins the republican nomination .

enrico letta says he will cut the tax burden , now over 45 % ; francois hollande wants angela merkel to meet him ‘ half way ’ and to say that “ treaty changes are not necessary ” to move forward with the banking union ; in an interview with the wall street journal francois hollande said he has " passed on messages to reassure angela merkel " that he " firmly believes in franco-german friendship " and that he had reprimanded his socialist party for their " clumsiness ” .
but he also signalled merkel needs to meet him halfway on key policies such as the " banking union " .
" the risk is that germany may want to wait until after its elections to move ahead on the banking union , " hollande said .
he pointed out that existing treaties allow for the establishment of banking union and that " it would only take ms. merkel to say that treaty changes are not necessary for things to move forward . "
as for france ’ s lagging competitiveness he told merkel : " i am telling her that i cannot achieve in one year what my predecessors didn 't do in 10 . "

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

she said her mother allowed her to check out anything she wanted .
one time , the librarian , who was the mother of one of beardsley ’ s friends , told beardsley she could not check out a book because of the library collection and services had out- grown the space by the controversial , and it wasn ’ t until a private donation of $ 500,000 district became the beneficiary of a house on broadway that a local resident had willed to the district .

but the ques- tion we asked was how the idea all along has been to take a picture during an out one of the car shows , going for a hike or a long bike ride , based .
we pushed the same photo out on our instagram and twitter photo .
we now attempt to find an activity that we can photograph and commitment to showcasing all aspects of the three partner “ family fun ” package ( based in seaside ) and a “ romance and a fourth package gave the viewer a chance to create his or her own unique package .

a of this inner tissue , and the cornea is allowed to heal there are two general ways to create the corneal flap now able to guide the laser in creating a more personalized flap in complications .
the higher safety trade- off with intralase is sometimes patients do not qualify for lasik and will need to have a procedure called prk instead .
prk has been practiced in layer of the cornea is removed before the laser is applied .
the if you ’ re in your 40s or 50s , you may find that your arms eye is corrected for distance and the other for near .
if a patient monovision contact lenses will be required to evaluate if he or she medication to help you relax .
the eye is held open by an instrument laser is done sculpting , the surgeon aligns the flap to its surgery , you may experience mild irritation or discomfort for a few hours .
vision may be slightly hazy but will improve by the the physi- cian will prescribe eye drops to reduce any swelling and driving .
due to the creation of the flap , the eyes may not be able the goal of lasik is to elim- inate refractive error , the surgery may only take a few minutes but those few minutes can have a tremendous impact .

he would have told you he got shalimar for his girls , but fathers need to have justifications for the mistakes they make .
his daughters were how he rationalized his moment of weakness for this regal canine .
shalimar was his ated when i was in middle school was an animal shelter .
in those days we called it “ the pound . ”
the shelter employ- ees were our after one of daddy ’ s visits to the pound , he returned to shalimar was unlike any dog i had ever seen .

i was used to boston terriers – compact , low to the followed the rules .
he knew you should not keep a dog in the store .
but on this busy day , we attempted to hide shalimar in the backroom , away from the prying eyes of our customers .
we posted a “ restroom out of order ” sign and stacked milk crates in front of smells of an active , nervous dog from wafting through the cracks in was fooled .
it didn ’ t take long after get- ting shalimar home to realize she was sick .
daddy took his dog to the vet .
in addition to being treated for “ kennel cough , ” shalimar was diag- nosed with hepatitis .
the vet tried unsuccessfully to get shalimar to eat .
after a few days he phoned my dad .
“ mr. brown , if you can get her to eat , she ’ ll be ok .
but she won ’ t eat for us .
we have tried eat .
one morning , as my dad was eating break- fast , shalimar laid big brown eyes up to meet the gaze of his sky blue ones and to get a piece of my ham , ” daddy said .
he doubt- ed she would eat it even if he gave her a bite .
but my daddy was always a soft touch for his dogs and daughters , so while he fussed he cut off a bite third and a fourth .
daddy got up and fried another piece of ham and another .
the appetite had returned , and soon her vitality and the afghan hound is one of the world ’ s oldest dog breeds .

i loved that library and never did warm up to the oth- ers , though i have a sizeable one of my own .

comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .
vitalin o vitalin ferret es un alimento muy balanciado y difinitivamente para recomendar .
todo lo que usted quiere conocer sobre jaulas de hamsters antes de obtener un hamster consigua una jaula para hamsters a prueba de fugas , sencillo de limpiar y lo suficientemente amplia . si bien las jaulas modulares con los tubos son divertidos , pueden ser dificiles de limpiar y pobres en la ventilacion ( y los tubos pueden ser demasiado pequeñas para algunos hamsters sirios ) . es inceible la capacidad de un hamster para escapar de la jaula , son capaces de masticar paredes de plastico de forma sorprendentemente rapida ademas de pasar por espacios muy pequeños .
hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .
lo que tiene que saber para la seleccion de comida para gatos .
nosotros somos lo que comemos , esto es valido también para los gatos que requieren de nosotros en cuanto a albergue y comida .
de hecho , la comida para gatos es lo mas primordial en el cuidado del felino , junto con las visitas a veterinarios .
algo importante a saber es que una correcta comida atrasa las visitas al veterinario asi como una serie de condiciones medicas peligrosas .
antes de seguir hay que cubrir algunos de los conceptos basicos , esto ayudara a lograr el objetivo de este articulo que es simplificarte la seleccion de la comida para gatos , enseñando a leer el rotulo de los piensos para gatos .
lo que tiene que conocer de las necesidades nutricionales esenciales de los gatos .
proteina de la carne , el pescado o aves de corral eso es lo que debe saber basicamente , aunque los gatos no necesitan hidratos de carbono , el maiz , el trigo y / o el arroz se utilizan como material de relleno para los alimentos enlatados y pienso gatos .
otros componentes , tales como aglutinantes , aromatizantes y colorantes , los fabricantes de comida para gato los añaden para satisfacer las exigencias esteticas de los compradores .
la comida enlatada no debe permanecer gran tiempo fuera aunque los preservativos utilizados mantengan los alimentos frescos para nuestros gatos .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

las aves requieren una dieta equilibrada con mucha variedad de indicados tipos de alimentos que poseen vitaminas y minerales necesarios .
usted debe garantizar de no ofrecerle a las aves nueces o semillas , sino que se le debe ofrecer comida para pajaros con gran valor nutricional .
al momento de la eleccion de la comida , las aves son dificiles ya que prefieren los frutos de cascara y las semillas en vez de los alimentos sutanciosos .
¿ que debe usted conocer a la hora de elegir la comida para los periquitos ?
siempre y cuando su perico tenga cariño , buena comida y los cuidados apropiados , se va a transformar en uno de los preferidos amigos en su hogar .
siempre que la dieta no sea unicamente de semillas sera buena para los pericos .
que su periquito ingiera semillas todos los dias es comparable a que usted coma carne en todas las comidas , esto no es saludable a largo plazo .
principalmente deben comer pienso y los demas dias pueden comer una diversidad de alimentos frescos .
abrir la heladera o buscar en los gabinetes de cocina : asi de facil sera hacer la comida para periquitos .
en la comida para agapornis prevalecen las frutas , granos y semillas .
al igual que a los loros , a los agapornis en cautiverio se los tiene que alimentar con una dieta similar .
una buena comida para agapornis formulada en forma de granulos conforman la base de su dieta .
al ser tan altas en grasas , las semillas no deben ser mas del 25 % de su dieta , por mas que les fascinen. tambien se aconseja ofrecer al ave gran variedad de frutas frescas y hortalizas .

una mezcla de vitaminas y minerales es la ideal dieta para un canario .
que el canario se nutra principalmente con una dieta de semillas primas , ya sea con un alimento de huevo de abba , cede , quiko , orlux o higgins de calidad , es lo aconsejado para el propietario del canario domestico tipico .
otra excelente opcion es una dieta granulada que proporciona alimentos sustanciosos en cada bocado .
¿ que se aconseja al momento de seleccionar la comida para los loros ?
se recomienda una comida para loros que incluya una gran diversidad de alimentos nutritivos recien elaborados , un bajo porcentaje de semillas y una dieta formulada ( piensos ) , tenendo en cuenta los requerimientos nutricionales de las aves .
recuerde que la mayoria de las comidas recien preparadas se descomponen rapidamente y tienen que ser separados de la jaula despues de un par de horas .
si el ave no es facil aprobar los nuevos alimentos , trate de invitarles temprano en la mañana o por la noche , ocasiones en aves que viven en su habitat en busca de alimento en la naturaleza .
escoger el tipo de jaula para conejo es muy importante .
las jaulas para conejos que son lo suficientemente amplias , simples de limpiar y comodo para entrar y salir para su conejo , hara que compartir tu hogar con tu conejo mucho mas facil .
una jaula que es lo sobradamente amplia es esencial para el bienestar de su conejo , pero no es un sustituto para el ejercicio y el tiempo de estar fuera de la jaula .
en el mercado hay ofrecidas un millon de jaulas que no son las aconsejadas para los conejos .
algunas son demasiado pequeñas , y muchas tienen pisos de alambre , que puede hacer la limpieza mas sencillo , pero que no brindan mucho consuelo para el conejo .
generalmente , mas grande es mejor .
si su conejo se pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo en una jaula , entonces , es mejor obtener la jaula mas amplia que sea practico en el hogar .
una guia util es calcular el tamaño de la jaula como veces el medida de tu conejo .
para los conejos grandes de mas de 8 kilos se aconseja una jaula de 30 " por 36 " y para los mas chicos una de 24 " por 36 " van bien .
asi mismo las jaulas conejos que tienen pisos y rampas que une a estos niveles suelen agradarles mucho a los conejos .
una de las cosas a remarcar es que la puerta debe ser lo bastante grande como para sacar al conejo y poder limpiar el lecho de arena .
una puerta lateral es posiblemente el mejor , como una primera abertura de la jaula hace que adquirir el conejo y un poco mas dificultoso ( y lo mejor es que el conejo pueda entrar y salir por su cuenta ) .
es vital revisar que la entrada tenga los rebordes lisos o cubiertos de plastico para evitar que el conejo o tu s lastimen .
todo lo que necesitas entender sobre como alimentar a tu conejo un saludable sistema digestivo depende de cuanta fibra su conejo ingiera .
la mayor parte de la dieta de los conejos comesticos consiste en heno de hierba frezca y hortalizas .
las proteinas incluidas en pienso para conejos tienen una alta proporcion en acidos aminados esenciales que son muy vital para el desarrollo de los musculos .
comida conejos asi mismo simplifica en la prevencion de las bolas de pelo .
hay que vigilar la cantidad de heno , veduras y pienso que el conejo consume ya que es muy primordial tener una moderacion en la comida para conejos .

que debo conocer sobre las chinchillas como mascotas y sus mordedores ?
antes de decidirse por una chinchilla como animal domestico , tiene informarse con sus caracteristicas distintivas y todas las facetas para su cuidado .
aqui hallara toda lainformacion y una guia de como tener cuidado una chinchilla , que cuidados debe tener , y cuales son los accesorios inpresindibles para manteneren la casa para una chinchilla .
con un manejo reposado desde una temprana edad la mayoria de las chinchillas se hara muy sumisas y estaran cerca con sus propietarios , aunque a veces no les gusta que se carguen o los abracen .
las chinchillas pueden encontrarse solas o juntas , pero de estar con otra chinchilla es recomendable que sean del mismo sexo , o hermanas o que esten juntas desde una temprana edad .
las chinchillas son muy energicas y vivarachas .
sus habitos son nocturnos , por lo que las chinchillas son mucho mas energicas durante la noche . los picos mas altos de actividad son durante cuando esta amaneciendo o durante el atardecer , por lo que se le suele llamar crepuscular . de todas maneras , deben ponerse en una zona bastante pasificadurante el dia .
los habitosy tener horarios para la alimentacion es muy importante ya que las mismas se estresan si hay cambios en su rutina diaria .
ya que las chinchillas son muy activas y les gusta jugar , necesitan su sitio para realizar ejercicio por lo que la jaulas chinchillas debe ser grande . para las chinchillas provenientes de temperaturas frias se deben tener cuidados de no ubicarlas en lugares muy calidos ya que el exeso de temperaturas les puede perjudicar .
para atesorar a las chinchillas sanas , una buena y euilibrado regimen de calidad es sumamente necesario . su sistema digestivo esta diseniado para comida para chinchillas con mucha fibra , por lo que una buena dieta debe tener mucha fibra y un monton de heno para chinchillas que es una hierba . una dieta inapropiada puede causar graves desordenes estomacales y contratiempo de salud . como algunas personas , las chinchillas tienen un diente dulce y pueden anteponeralimentarse cosas que no son oportunas para ellos por lo que se debe usar con cuidado . las chinchillas requieren una gran cantidad de forraje , y el regimen ante todo debe estar consistido de una hierba de heno de buena calidad , junto con bolitas elaboradas de chinchillas una cucharadita por dia en total . el sistema digestivo de las chinchillas es bastante perceptivo por lo que cualquier modificacion en el regimen debe ser gradual . las hermosas chinchillas tienen un deseo insaciable de roer .
esto se debe a las chinchillas , como todos los roedores , tienen dientes que crecen de forma continuada por la vida .
estos dientes deben ser continuamente desgastado al roer .
asegúrese de que hay un montón de mordedores para chinchilla .
al ser mascotas activos , las chinchillas requieren una jaula para chinchillas extensa , espaciosa , ideal con multiples pisos . lo ideal es que haya una jaula configurado y listo antes de transladar su casa chinchilla , para hacer la cambio a su casa mucho mas facil . ademas de la jaula , tendra accesorios , incluyendo una caja nido , botella de agua , banio de polvo , y algunos juguetes para masticar .
el bano de polvo solo debe ponerse a disposicion de la chinchilla de forma alternadamente para que la misma pueda preservar su gruesa piel en forma optima.tenga en cuenta que no es recomendable proveer un bano de agua a una chinchilla esto no solo ayudara a revolcarse en el polvo para concervar su piel tersa y sedosa de espesor , que se cree que es relajante y divertido para chinchillas . otros polvos o granos de arena pueden verse o sentirse similar , pero no va a desempenarse de la igual forma - el polvo de chinchilla se hace para imitar lo que se tiene acceso en su habitat natural .

“ early on i developed an obsession for old things and a respect of old things .
and i developed a respect for ethnicities , ” he says .
“ i grew up in a very multi-ethnic neighborhood : mexicans , greeks , italians , and japanese & # 8211 ; those were my friends .
“ i was so little .
the mummy was in a glass case ; i was eye level .
i remember the rest of the class being taken away .
i lingered alone with the mummy .
“ i traveled to mexico as a boy with my dad and uncles on fishing trips , ” he says .
“ that changed me considerably . part of the time i was on my own & # 8211 ; all alone .

“ i grew up on a cock-fighting ranch in eastern oklahoma in the 1950s … spending my summers there until i was 13 . ”
the interesting thing about smith is that he can make the connection from fighting cocks to the ancient greeks in the squeak of a marker on a white board .
“ even in my childhood experiences i see a lot of analogies , ” he says .
“ the greeks were into the fighting chickens … and giving gifts of roosters and even hens . and there are other places where chickens are important . ”
smith says that his time in the yucatán living with the mayans drew parallel lines for him to greece and fed his passion on all levels : the archaeologist , the cultural anthropologist , the linguistic anthropologist .
“ the mayans rejected the idea of malaria .
they say [ it happened ] because i was messing with the bees .
they said , & # 8216 ; you and that beekeeper did not apologize to the bees for the ones you killed when you were taking honey . & # 8217 ; we were supposed to apologize and go through a whole ritual , and we did not do it enough .
“ that is why they also said i got sick , because i was a … foreigner .

the team had lost its final two home games of the season .
the storm also faced a 21-point deficit in its semifinal game against big bend on the way to the championship .
but in the end , chemeketa still came out on top .
“ i have so much love for this group of kids .
and even though we struggled at times , i am so proud of how hard we fought and competed , and how mentally tough we were . ”
“ it was a struggle for us for 33 minutes , ” abderhalden said , perhaps understating the depth of the hole that chemeketa was in at the time .
but the storm put on a full-court press that stifled big bend .
chemeketa , which forced 21 turnovers during the course of the game , initiated a couple of key stops , hit a couple of threes , and went on a 27- 5 run to end up with a thrilling win .
begin hit the three that put the storm on top by one point with 40 seconds to go , and big bend , facing a smothering defense , couldn & # 8217 ; t get a basket in its final possession .
a runner from kauffman , a lay-up by phillips , and threes by batey and molan then put the storm on top .
edmonds began to heat up from the field , however , and they surged back to tie the game as time was running down .
momentum shifted once more as edmonds came roaring out of the box with a 14-2 run to start the second half .
batey converts a three-point-play , and he did so again midway through the second half of a backcourt steal .
then begin connected on a short jumper and came up with a steal and a flashy pass to batey for the lay-in .
chemeketa called a timeout to set-up a play that worked to perfection .
howard was able to beat his man off the dribble and get the bucket with 40 seconds remaining .
“ it was so awesome to win because of all the adversity we have overcome this season , ” molan said .
“ our goal at the start of the season was to win the nwacc title , and it was so great to play for each other and achieve that goal together . ”
molan was selected to the second team , batey was named to the first team , and phillips was named tournament mvp .
starr , who also serves as the adviser to the group , was initially responsible for bringing brito into the asc fold .
brito says , “ i was doing homework by the office when peter approached me .
we started talking , and then he asked me if i wanted a job as an asc .
i sat through an interview , filled out an application , and got the job . ”
starr says , “ one of the things asc members do a really good job of is voter registration .
we were able to register a ton of students to vote this year .
our purpose was to educate students why voting is vital .
“ i also thought our asc members did a great job of informing people about candidates without misinforming or angling the information . ”
brito says , “ we try to focus on local politics that are usually education-based .
our job is basically to fight for students here . ”
but thanks to a petition and a vote by the members of the asc , the proposal was not pursued .
in that case , at least , “ we were put in a position to lead , ” asc member aaron tagabuel says .
and the members of the asc seem to be a big fan of their boss .
“ he is a no-nonsense kind of a guy , but he is a joker at the same time , ” tagabuel says .
brito says , “ he is a really good mentor , and he is one of the chillest guys you will ever meet .
the other day we played hackie sack for 20 minutes with our boss .
who else does that with their superior ? ”
look at the picture of the asc members on the group & # 8217 ; s brochure and you & # 8217 ; ll see peopleof many different races and ethnicities .
“ we want to try to be as approachable as we possibly can to make students feel comfortable talking with us , ” brito says .
“ writing is like sex .

thursday ’ s event was a chance to meet sullivan and hear about the experiences that he has had during the course of his writing and traveling .
“ i wanted to go the creative and freelance route .
so i got a creative writing degree from cornel , ” he said .
he was not naïve , however .
sullivan said that writing “ does help to keep the day job .
there are not a lot of opportunities out there , and freelance writing can be just as stressful as journalism . ”
and so he was forced to start writing as a freelance journalist , providing occasional articles for various newspapers .
it was not lucrative .
sullivan also encouraged the use of similes and metaphors : “ it ’ s true you can overdo these , but they can also be fun to do .
it ’ s really important you make sure you use the right metaphor for what you are talking about , though . ”
he said he was confident about his knowledge of the state ’ s geography , but he does not often write with a descriptive tone .
bill mccoy , a chemeketa student , said he attended because he has a “ love for nature and a love of exploring nature , and i want to become better at describing my experiences to family and friends . ”
“ i get to go hiking for a living .
i really enjoy it , ” he said .
the result is a new area called the veteran & # 8217 ; s lounge .
future plans call for the additions of a computer and a mini-fridge .
cindy ramey , a second-year chemeketa student , is one of the users of the lounge .
ramey was in the military for nearly eight years , serving two tours in iraq .
“ i love that we have a place to go to get away from the chaos of other students .
sometimes it is too much to be around so many people where it can get be really loud , ” she said . & # 8220 ; i love that i can go into the lounge [ and ] do my homework in peace and quiet . ” • shortstop gecy bowman who led the storm in batting average ( .396 ) , homeruns ( 8 ) , and was second in runs batted in ( 21 ) • pitcher kristina meza who had the lowest earned run average in the team last season ( 4.67 ) • sophomore pitcher carrie bess who led all chemeketa pitchers in wins and strikeouts while having an era of 6.24 . • sophomore third basemen danielle upton who had 4 homeruns last year and an rbi of 21 .

“ being a professor is a lot harder than you would think , ” stated dr. paul madlock , an assistant professor in the department of psychology and communications at the college of arts and sciences .
with professors as easy-going and affable as madlock , it ’ s no mystery as to why being a professor is perceived as such an easy task .
however , with a look at his 20 publications , one can get a clearer understanding as to why being a communications professor isn ’ t what it seems and why madlock is such a diligent professor .
