une cuisine , c 'est le lieu où l 'on cuisine , certes mais c 'est aussi bien plus que cela .
ce n 'est pas pour rien qu 'elle est à une place de choix dans l 'architecture de la maison .
vous devez donc la faire à votre image et voici pourquoi : la cuisine , c 'est un lieu où l 'on partage avec ses proches .
c 'est souvent autour de la table qu 'ont lieu les plus grands débats que l 'ont peut faire dans une famille .
c 'est autour du dîner que l 'on apprend les bonnes manières aux enfants : on leur apprend à dire merci , à rester assis , à manger proprement , à ne pas parler la bouche pleine , etc .
la cuisine , c 'est aussi le lieu où les générations se retrouvent réunies : le livre de recette de grand-mère , qu 'elle a parfois elle-même reçu de sa grand-mère .
plusieurs générations qui s 'allient pour créer des plats mémorables qui feront les premiers souvenirs de chacun d 'entre-nous .
nous avons tous une recette fétiche que notre mère faisait souvent , qu 'elle nous a parfois apprise à faire nous-mêmes .
tout cela dans la même cuisine .
plus qu 'un lieu de partage , la cuisine est aussi un lieu de vie .
chacun y passe beaucoup de temps pour une chose ou pour une autre .
certains y jouent , certains y étudient , certains parfois se rapprochent dans la cuisine .
ce lieu central dans toute maison aura vu bien des joies arriver .
la cuisine , c 'est probablement l 'espace où l 'on se sent le plus chez soi .
on n 'oublie pas la cuisine de son enfance , notre mère ou notre père qui cuisine pour nous .
les surprises d 'anniversaire , les bonnes odeurs d 'épices , de gâteux , de plats en tous genres : tout cela reste gravé dans notre esprit à jamais !
maintenant , c 'est à vous de construire tous ces souvenirs en famille , à vous d 'appeler vos enfants pour le petit déjeuner le matin .
pour qu 'ils gardent toujours un bon souvenir de cette pièce , il ne faut pas la négliger et être prêt à faire appel aux meilleurs artisans pour lui donner tout le charme et l 'élégance qu 'elle mérite .
craquez pour une cuisine design , élégante et mémorable qui saura plaire à votre famille et qui vous offrira de merveilleux moments de complicité et d 'amour .
et , pour pouvoir faire de bons petits plats à tous ceux qui viendront vous rendre visite , il vous faudra les bons ustensiles .
vous êtes prêts maintenant : aux fourneaux !
adepte de la location de voitures , vous préférez louer à longue durée que d 'acheter .
vous n 'avez pas envie de passer du temps à expertiser les meilleures offres de leasing ?
vous n 'avez pas de temps à perdre à hésiter entre tel prestataire et tel autre ?
vous voulez aller au plus vite droit au but , et obtenir de façon sûre le meilleur prix et les meilleurs conditions ?
pensez au courtage !
un courtier en leasing automobile , c 'est l 'assurance d 'une recherche optimisée et d 'une négociation performante .
un courtier automobile négocie directement auprès de ses multiples partenaires , et grâce à lui , vous obtenez des remises largement compétitives sur la base des prix catalogue .
autre avantage non négligeable du courtage , vous avez la possibilité de choisir de façon personnalisée les services que vous souhaitez inclure dans votre forfait : entretien , assistance , perte financière , vous ne payer que ce dont vous avez besoin .
disposant d 'une flotte de véhicule inépuisable et d 'un choix de modèles considérable , le courtier vous propose un large éventail de possibilités , allant de la citadine au cabriolet en passant par la voiture familiale .
nissan micra , volvo c70 , ford mondeo ... vous payez un forfait mensuel qui va généralement de 200 à 600 euros selon le modèle choisi , sur 37 mois et 45000 km parcourus , et bien sûr , sans apport .
de quoi être sûr que côté location de voiture , tout va idéalement bien rouler pour vous et vos passagers .
chez soi , on veut le plus de confort possible vis-à-vis du frais en été comme du chaud en hiver .
c 'est pourquoi les choix de son chauffage et de ses fenêtres est crucial .
tout d 'abord le chauffage central se fait , soit par le fioul , soit par le bois , soit par le gaz .
ces trois solutions ont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients que nous allons voir maintenant .
le fioul est très efficace pour chauffer une maison et c 'est un gros avantage mais il y a un inconvénient à peu près aussi gros en retour : le prix .
le fioul est de plus en plus cher ( jusqu 'à 4000 € pour un plein ) et cette augmentation n 'est pas prête de s 'arrêter donc , à voir en fonction de votre budget .
le bois , quant à lui , est la solution la plus écologique et la moins chère mais pas forcément la plus efficace .
si vous avez une conscience écologique , vous pouvez vous lancer sans hésiter car le bois est une très bonne solution de chauffage .
enfin , le gaz est aussi efficace mais , personnellement , je pense que je vivrais perpétuellement dans la peur que ma maison explose ...
donc , je ne saurais vous le conseiller .
pour les chauffages de votre maison , vous avez une fois encore le choix entre des poêles à bois et des radiateurs électriques .
le poêle à bois est une bonne solution pour chauffer une pièce et il donne du cachet à votre pièce mais la solution la plus pratique et la plus économique reste le chauffage électrique .
facile à installer et très efficace , il chauffe rapidement , ne nécessite aucun stock de matériaux ( avoir un stock de bois pour un poêle demande d 'avoir de la place , ce qui n 'est pas le cas de tout le monde ) .
vous pouvez donc sans hésiter faire le choix de l 'électrique pour vos radiateurs !
quels vaccins pour quels pays ?
la mise à jour des vaccinations contre le tétanos , la poliomyélite et la diphtérie est recommandée pour la plupart des voyageurs . selon le pays visité , il peut être nécessaire d ’ aussi avoir la vaccination contre l ’ hépatite a , la fièvre jaune ou la méningite . avant de voyager à l ’ étranger , prévoyez une consultation avec votre médecin . non seulement il vous recommandera les vaccins préalables à votre voyage , mais s ’ assurera aussi que votre état de santé général est stable et que vous avez toutes vos prescriptions régulières afin d ’ éviter des ennuis médicaux .
vous en saurez plus sur mon blog de voyage , n 'hésiter pas à y laisser des commentaires .
les yogourts sont très présents sur les tablettes réfrigérées de votre épicerie . mais pourquoi sont-ils si bons pour vous ?
faisant partie de la famille de produits laitiers , le yogourt est un choix intelligent dans votre régime alimentaire , car il contient des protéines et est faible en matières grasses ( bien lire l ’ étiquette avant d ’ acheter ) . aussi , le processus de fermentation du yogourt transforme le lactose en acide lactique , il peut donc être mieux digéré par les individus intolérants au lactose . aussi , lorsque vous prenez des antibiotiques ou lorsque vous avez des problèmes de diarrhées , le yogourt agit efficacement et vous permet de surmonter de façon naturelle ces désagréments .

и кто бы мог подумать , что недалеко от рая серфингистов и золотистых пляжей майами существует место , заставляющее ученых ломать голову уже не первый десяток лет .
коралловый замок – построенный эдвардом лидскалнином , представляет собой поистине чудесное творение .
это целый комплекс огромных статуй и мегалитов , общим весом , превышающий 1 тыс. тонн .
не чудо – скажете вы и окажетесь не правы .
а дело в том , что весь этот грандиозный комплекс построен всего одним человеком без использования специализированной техники .
как ?
не знаю , и сказать не могу , ведь уже год за годом ученые не могут разгадать тайну этого места .
jungle island – остров джунглей майами является одним из самых посещаемых мест в городе семьями и туристами . эти джунгли представляют собой огромный парк , где выставлены на обозрение посетителям различные виды птиц и животных , земноводных и редких растений .
однако одна из самых главных достопримечательностей парка это , несомненно , лигр – гибрид льва и тигрицы .
заповедник площадью в 7,5 гектаров , насчитывает около 3 тысяч попугаев и тысячи растений .
тут представлены редчайшие виды флоры и фауны данной климатической зоны .
в парке можно увидеть одно из самых известных по всему миру шоу дрессированных птиц и шоу экзотических животных .
и без сомнения , стоит посетить символ штата флорида – на озере розовых фламинго .
помимо огромного парка , существует внутри острова джунглей и миниатюрный зоопарк , в котором посетители увидят старейшую черепаху , получат возможность сфотографироваться с питомцами зоопарка и покормить их .
особенное впечатление произведет фотография с живым удавом боа .

as nibert put it , “ the horse is out of the barn . ”
the board of education was ordered to supply the videos and comply with the subpoena which it did .
as for that video which tatterson said was “ essential ” to his case , nibert said he had never seen it , though that would all change by the end of the bench trial .
tatterson ’ s first witness was summer mitchell , a teacher ’ s aide at ppis who was on the bus at the time of the incident .
mitchell said her back was to moffett and the student during part of the incident and she didn ’ t see how the student got off the bus but she heard a struggle and screaming .
she said she didn ’ t believe the student walked off the bus of his own free will , that moffett assisted in some way .
a 12-year old student who was a fifth grader at ppis at the time of the incident also testified .
the student was one of several others who were asked to exit the bus by moffett who directed all the seats in front of the student who wasn ’ t complying be cleared .
the 12-year old witness said moffett rolled the male student off the bus , tossed him to the ground and put his knee in the student ’ s back , “ slamming ” his head on the ground , twice .
the 12-year old witness claimed the male student was not kicking and screaming and said , aloud , that he couldn ’ t breathe .
shortly after lunch , court reconvened with moffett ’ s attorney , jim lees , making a motion for acquittal .
lees said the state had produced “ zero proof ” that his client had caused injury to the student .
lees also took issue with the state not calling any teachers or the bus driver to the stand .
tatterson said his office had unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena the bus driver and as for his other witnesses , he believed he had called the appropriate ones to prove his case .

oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

ali reza explained why he left : " i wanted to build my future , i wanted to continue my education and i wanted to develop .
and i thought it was a way for me . "
he headed to tehran , where he contacted smugglers .
friends had given him their numbers .
the smugglers told him : " don 't worry , it will be ok . "
pedion areos was " not a safe place , " he told us .
" even the police that are in charge of protecting the people are a danger for us . "
ali reza made it to europe .
so did arazu and her children .
but death stalks this journey , and others aren 't so lucky .
" i love it here , " she says .
" i am so thankful and appreciative to the german government .
my sons go to school , all the things they would never have had the opportunity to do . "
arazu had last spoken to her girls on zahra 's birthday .
someyeh had called and asked her mother if there was a way to celebrate .
she wanted her mom to see if the smugglers would let them play in the park next door .
zahra told her mother she was sleeping on the floor and sharing a blanket with someyeh .
" this place is no good , " arazu recalls her saying .
" nobody is looking after us . "
those days are hazy in arazu 's memory .
but one moment stands out .
yasin was visiting arazu in the hospital , and he passed her the phone .
it was zahra .
they had been released from the detention center .
" i was really happy , " arazu says .
" i got better . "
personalized clay pendants they 've made are etched with dreamlike stories reflecting their lives .
someyeh 's pendant tells of going to germany , where the family will be " very happy " and she can train to be a nutritionist .
zahra 's tells the story of chicks who lose their mother and are taken away by a cat .
but " her mother comes , tells the cat to go away and here they are together , " zahra explains , twisting the pendant around as she tells the story .
zahra looks up as she finishes her tale .
roberto chaidi , a stocky man who sits proudly amid the piles of socks in his eponymous store in central athens , tells us he is a golden dawn member .
his shop is surrounded by the multicultural make-up of greece , but he says illegal immigrants do not respect the country 's way of life .
merging cultures , he says , is too hard , asking : " is it possible to mix a chihuahua with a pit bull ? "
golden dawn has been accused of violence , but chaidi says the party is defending the country .
" if fighting for my nation means that i get to be called a nazi and a racist , " he said , " then i am . "
it was a miserable existence , and ali reza has had enough .
he plans to return to afghanistan .
he told us authorities had supplied him with a ticket out of greece and a promise of 300 euros on his arrival in kabul .
he spends a final evening with the immigrants who took him in as one of their own .
ali reza is so grateful to them that he can barely find the words .
" i wish i had something to give you , " he tells them .
" but i have nothing . "
the next morning , he packs his backpack and walks to athens ' syntagma square to take a bus to the airport .
he sells his phone for 30 euros to pay for the 5 euro bus ticket , and he boards with a quick backward glance at the city .
the bavarian refugee council pays 365 euros for the test , but the outlay is a struggle for the human rights organization .
arazu is not in a position to help ; as a refugee , she receives 1,000 euros in benefits to live on each month .
she sends 200 euros to the friend who lent her money to get her daughters into europe .
" i have a present for you , " she tells them .
" from all the children , and from all of us . "
she hands over a packet of white paper wrapped in a pink ribbon .
the girls unfold it and gaze at the contents .
it takes a few seconds for them to comprehend what it means .
arazu is still standing outdoors .
an arsis interpreter pokes his head out the door and sweeps his arms toward her in excitement .

sicherheitsschuhe haben am vorderen teil eine schutzkappe aus kunststoff oder metall , welche für den schutz der zehen vorgesehen ist .

im mittelalter trug die bauersfrau im wesentlichen lange einfach genähte kleider aus selbst gewebtem leinen stoff .
manchmal färbte man ihn mit naturfarben ein , die man aus blaubeeren , spinat roten rüben , walnuss schalen oder safran gewann .
unterwäsche trug man kaum außer in sehr kalten monaten ein hemd aus wolle oder leinen .
im sommer ging frau barfuß , im winter trug sie meist bund schuhe aus selbst gegerbtem leder , umwickelt mit hanfseil oder holz pantinen mit socken aus selbst geschorener , selbst gesponnener und selbst gestrickter schafwolle .
der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .
auch samt aus china wurde herangeschafft und zu schönen , langen bestickten und mit perlen genähten kleidern verarbeitet .
dazu trugen die damen bei hofe oft eine schleppe und einen kunstvoll genähten umhang .

es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .

herumliegende gegenstände , elektrogeräte oder heiße herdplatten & # 8211 ; alles gefahrenquellen , an denen man sich verletzen kann .
doch mit ein paar tricks kann man unfälle im haushalt vermeiden .
als häufige gefahrenquellen in haushalten zählen herumliegende gegenstände .
indem man gegenstände nach ihrem gebrauch sofort wieder an ihren platz räumt , sorgt man nicht nur für ordnung , sondern vermindert auch das risiko sich an ihnen zu verletzen .
schnell können herumliegende gegenstände nämlich zu stolperfallen werden .
also alles nach seinem gebrauch wieder weg räumen .
vor allem auf treppen sollte man niemals etwas liegen lassen .
denn gerade hier kommt man leicht ins stolpern und es drohen schwere verletzungen .

“ he is a friar who exemplifies the franciscan tradition of a contemplative lifestyle , which carries with it a connection to those he is in accompany with whether it be one of his mountain brothers , students on campus , or even someone in the gowanda prison program , ” kuzara said .
“ with all those people , i got a sense of him seeing the inherit goodness in others . ”

coach david abderhalden also was named the coach of the year in the conference .
outside hitter mikayla morgan , outside hitter keri stein , and designated setter jourdan wenzinger ( volleyball ) ; “ we wanted to … establish where we are now on how the classroom recycling was going , see what kind of things were still going into the trash , and what changes we can make to accommodate so we can get [ the college ’ s ] trash down to as low as possible . ”
“ we put on gloves , we dig through it ; it ’ s kind of gross , but it doesn ’ t take a long time , and it ’ s kind of fun and interesting , ” fregosi said , explaining what is involved with volunteering for an audit .
“ we knew we had to make adjustments in game two because we did not hit the ball well at all in the first game . ”

even though the storm dropped two in a row on saturday to mt .
hood , the team is still in the playoff hunt .
chemeketa has a gem tucked away on the east side of campus .
from a distance , you can & # 8217 ; t see anything more than a few greenhouses and some plants .
up close , however , there is a passion for plants – and from now until mid-june , students , staff , and the community are able to partake in thehorticulture program ’ s plant sale .
the greenhouses are located between the red and brown parking lots on the east side of campus .
one of those students is brianna lucas . she has attended chemeketa for two and a half years and recently graduated from the program .
lucas now is working on flowers in the floriculture program .
she said that she liked being around the plants and wantedto possibly one day own a flower shop .
christeena deroo is currently one of three employees at the greenhouses .
she was the first graduate from thehorticulture program nearly three years ago and wanted to stay involved on campus .
deroo knows all about the greenhouses and what it takes to educate students thoroughly .
“ we have a diverse system in our greenhouses , ” she said .
“ students get to see so many set-ups ; we have to have a broad range . ”
another officially member of the staff is rozie , a 3-year-old cat who hangs out in the warmth of the greenhouses .
the soft carpet tickles between her toes at the early hours of the morning .
“ depending on the day , my feet hit the floor around 5 : 30 a.m. , ” fay demeyer says .
but demeyer is no one-note wonder .
along with teaching psychology classes at chemeketa on tuesdays and thursdays , she also : teaches for the university of phoenix on tuesdays and thursdays ; demeyer also serves as the chairman of the march of dimes foundation and is currently working on two projects for the organization : bowties for babies and high hopes .
“ when i get home , i organize my planner and my clothes for the next day , ” she says , ensuring that her outfits are appropriate for what ’ s ahead .
“ throughout my life , i have overcome a lot .
i came out of foster care and was illiterate until my mid-teens , ” she says .
the craziness of her schedule doesn ’ t affect what happens in her classes , however .
but balance is important to her as well .
that shows up in her social life .
“ i love riding my motorcycle with my husband , phil , and being together .
we ’ ve ran half-marathons , and we ’ re always working on how we can improve our businesses , ” she says .
she even has time for barbecues and spending time with her granddaughter , madi , who is 4 .
“ work to me is not eight hours a day , ” she says .
“ it ’ s from the moment i wake up till the moment my head hits the pillow .
i was raised as a migrant worker and was used to working long hours with no sleep . ”
“ i am always looking for resources to make my life easier .
i drink lots of mountain dew and have low carb protein bars throughout the day .
i save my big meal for when i get home so i can eat with my husband , ” she says .
“ the way i look at it , you have the days you have , so what are you going to do with them ? ”
“ i usually have 30 to 45 minutes of quiet time to reflect on myself .
what do i want to present ?
what are my goals ?
is what i am teaching going to move me closer or further away to those goals ? ”
her dreams keep her occupied for a time before she drifts off to sleep , she says .
but the sound of the alarm clock arrives quickly , and once again her feet slide off the bed and she races off to yet another busy day .
come for the wine , but stay for the education you have been cordially invited to a learning event the northwest viticulture center in the eola hills in west salem is a largely unknown entity of chemeketa .
“ it was one of the nicer days we had had in a while , so the backdoor was opened up to the vineyard just beyond , and this gorgeous jazz was playing throughout the sound system .
“ as i walked by and saw all this , i thought , ‘ you know , if any prospective student could be standing here , looking at this scene , just taking it all in , they would sign-up on the spot ’ – it was so evocative and inviting . ”
and although he ’ s new to the viticulture center , adams says the eola campus is an outstanding place for a person to need to travel to each day .
“ and then you learn how to make wine on top of it .
why not ? ” he says .
the driveway to the campus does a splendid job of preparing visitors for the beauty awaiting them at the top of the hill .
the patio on the backside of bldg. 1 overlooks those 8 acres , as well as the willamette river and the grassy willamette valley below .
at eola , macdonald says , “ we take it from the grape , to the wine , to the sales . ”
“ it just opens up a lot more doors for people . ”
“ i don ’ t know of any of our students who have gone through the whole program that haven ’ t gone out and been able to find a job in the wine world , ” watson says .
the repercussion of these programs on the wine economy , and within the wine industry , is profound .
cortell says that between osu and eola , there has been “ quite a few years of adding a lot of educational value that helps raise the bar and the quality and the status of oregon wines .
“ we ’ ve had a lot of good students come through .
and those of us on the faculty – we ’ ve also worked in the industry , so we come with a lot of industry experience .
“ i lost my job in 2011 , ” fischer says , “ and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to re-examine my life – to think about what my next step was going to be .
for a student or career-minded individual who has a passion for wine , and also may be looking for an employment opportunity within a thriving business economy , eola stands as an excellent option .
“ late in the evening , ” adams says , “ looking out over the vineyard at the sun just beginning to set in the west – amazing . ”
“ if there is nothing else you walk a way with from this class and trip , it & # 8217 ; s that i can make a difference . there is a lot of pride of indigenous community , and if you are a photographer you should bring a camera . it is beautiful ! ”
the questions : how would you feel about a tuition increase ?
and if tuition is raised , where do you want the money to go ?
“ but students are still not rising to the challenge , ” he said .
“ as students , our job is to inform the decision-making process of the administration , ” he said .
“ if no one steps up to voice their opinion , then [ the administration ] is just going to go on whatever they think is best . ”
“ quite honestly , ” cutz said , “ i believe the decision was already made .
the asc represented students , but i don & # 8217 ; t believe it was as big a factor in the board & # 8217 ; s decision-making process as we would have liked it to have been . ”
“ i think accessibility is going to be tough , ” she said .
