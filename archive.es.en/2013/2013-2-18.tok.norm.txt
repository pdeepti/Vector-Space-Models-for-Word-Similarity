the approach relies on engineered materials consisting of nanostructured semiconductor alloy crystals .
heat is a vibration of matter — technically , a vibration of the atomic lattice of a material — just as sound is .
such vibrations can also be thought of as a stream of phonons — a kind of “ virtual particle ” that is analogous to the photons that carry light .
the new approach is similar to recently developed photonic crystals that can control the passage of light , and phononic crystals that can do the same for sound .

even if it was just a meteor that hit the earth and there was no hero , the situation is kind of odd .
almost too odd to believe it was just a meteor big enough to cause a sonic boom and leave no evidence .

romney claims decisive victories in michigan , arizonavar och vad att spela i ett online black jack blackjack är ett populärt spel som har sina rötter i kortspelet 21 , ett hasardspel som spelats i flera hundra år i europa .
oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

[ 4 ] she debuted at the vienna state opera as adina in l 'elisir d 'amore and at the metropolitan opera as mimì in la bohème . [ 5 ] in 1994 , she was auditioned by the conductor sir georg solti for a new production of la traviata at the royal opera house .
her debut as violetta led her to international stardom .
she has recorded many recital albums and complete opera recordings and often appears on television and in concerts .
the emi recording of massenet 's manon with gheorghiu in the title role won the 2001 gramophone award for " best opera recording " , was nominated for " best opera recording " in the 2002 grammy awards . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the emi recording of puccini 's tosca with gheorghiu , roberto alagna and ruggero raimondi in the title roles brought her the deutscher schallplattenpreis award in 2002 . [ 15 ] she also won diapason d 'or awards , choc du monde de la musique in france , cecilia prize in belgium , the echo award , the italian musica e dischi , foreign lyric production award , the usa critics ' award .
gheorghiu won the title of female artist of the year at the classic brit awards in 2001 and 2010 . [ 16 ] she was honoured with " la medaille vermeille de la ville de paris " and she was appointed an officier de l 'ordre des arts et des lettres and chevalier de l 'ordre des arts et lettres by the french ministry of culture and by her native country romania . [ citation needed ] in december 2010 , gheorghiu was awarded a doctor honoris causa by the university of arts in iasi ( romania ) [ 17 ] and the star of romania , the highest decoration given by the president of romania . [ 18 ] " because i grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion , it makes me stronger now .
lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out .
but i have the courage to be , in a way , revolutionary .
i want to fight for opera , for it to be taken seriously .
pop music is for the body , but opera is for the soul . " . [ 20 ] gheorghiu had a problematic relationship with former metropolitan opera general manager joseph volpe after her debut there as mimì in 1993 .
in 1996 , gheorghiu was cast as micaela in a new production of carmen , opposite waltraud meier and plácido domingo .
the production by franco zeffirelli called for micaela to wear a blonde wig , which gheorghiu disliked .
when the met toured the production in japan in 1997 , she refused to wear it on the first night to which volpe famously declared , " the wig is going on , with you or without you " and replaced her with an understudy . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] she appeared at the met again in 1998 for six performances of roméo et juliette with her husband , tenor roberto alagna as roméo .
volpe had planned to engage gheorghiu in violetta valery for a new production of la traviata , to premiere in november 1998 and directed by zeffirelli .
alagna was to sing the role of violetta 's lover , alfredo germont .
according to volpe , gheorghiu and alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract .
they eventually signed their contracts , and faxed them to the met one day past their deadline .
volpe refused to accept them .
the production opened with patricia racette and marcelo álvarez as the lovers . [ 21 ] in september 2007 , gheorghiu was dismissed from lyric opera of chicago 's production of la bohème by general manager william mason , for missing rehearsals and costume fittings , and generally " unprofessional " behavior .
gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband , who was singing at the met in roméo et juliette and rehearsing for puccini 's madama butterfly and added " i have sung ' boheme ' hundreds of times , and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn 't be a tragedy .
it was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time i was in new york . [ 23 ] " when the curtain opened on la rondine at covent garden , the audience gasped and applauded .
people want to dream .
if directors want to do something new with operas , why not do something beautiful ? " [ 26 ] despite these issues , gheorghiu and alagna returned to the metropolitan opera for five performances of l 'elisir d 'amore in 1999 and for four performances of faust in 2003 .
gheorghiu also performed at the met as liù in turandot in 2000 ; as violetta in la traviata opposite jonas kaufmann in 2006 and 2007 ; as amelia in simon boccanegra in 2007 ; as mimì in la bohème in 2008 ; as magda in the 2008 / 09 season in the roh / sfo production of la rondine , the met 's first performance of the opera since 1936 ; and for the 2009 / 10 season she appeared as violetta , replacing her previous engagement as marie antoinette in a rare revival of john corigliano 's the ghosts of versailles which was replaced due to the recession . ^ monitorul oficial , decretul 921 din 27 septembrie 2010 privind conferirea ordinului national steaua romaniei in grad de comandor ^ " que quiere expresar sus fantasías , olvidándose de los personajes .

die meisten unfälle passieren nicht im verkehr , sondern zu hause .
denn im haushalt lauern viele gefahren .
herumliegende gegenstände , elektrogeräte oder heiße herdplatten & # 8211 ; alles gefahrenquellen , an denen man sich verletzen kann .
doch mit ein paar tricks kann man unfälle im haushalt vermeiden .
als häufige gefahrenquellen in haushalten zählen herumliegende gegenstände .
indem man gegenstände nach ihrem gebrauch sofort wieder an ihren platz räumt , sorgt man nicht nur für ordnung , sondern vermindert auch das risiko sich an ihnen zu verletzen .
schnell können herumliegende gegenstände nämlich zu stolperfallen werden .
also alles nach seinem gebrauch wieder weg räumen .
vor allem auf treppen sollte man niemals etwas liegen lassen .
denn gerade hier kommt man leicht ins stolpern und es drohen schwere verletzungen .
was in eine andere etage soll , sollte man lieber gleich dorthin bringen .

probablemente , de adulto acabara durmiendo en el lugar en el que vivio de cachorro .
si el perro sera una mascota de interior , seleccione una ubicacion donde no moleste , que sea fresco y este perfectamente ventilado .
si a un cachorro se le permite dormir en la cama del amo , en un futuro se trasnformara en unfastidiosos socio .
si el perro va a vivir al aire libre debe estar refugiados contra el viento y la lluvia por una casa de perro que se puede encontrar en cualquier tienda de perros .
la casa debe tener suficiente espacio como para que el perro quepa de lleno y de una un giro de un circulo completo antes de acostarse .
durante los meses de invierno , una tela gruesa debe ser puesta sobre la puerta para mantener el calor y impedir que el viento y la humedad ingresen .

asegurese de higienizar la casa del perro con regularidad para preservar al perro sano y comodo .

que los perros jueguen con otros perros , es muchas veces el ideal ejercicio ..

es muy dificil conservar una casa a prueba de hurones por lo que hay que vigilar a los hurones cuando andan sueltos por la casa .
ya es bastante dificil mantener una habitacion individual enteramente reguardada para hurones , y mucho menos tener una casa entera para el huron.todavia esaconsejable invertir en una casa muy buena para el huron si usted esta pensando cuidar bien su pequeño y energico huron .
una jaula hurones amplia , bien diseñada es una requisito .
lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .
hay una amplia variedad de seleccion de jaula de hurones , yo aconsejo la huron 50 y huron 60 que son de alta calidad y provienen de proveedores de alimentos reconocidos .
los fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas ya ofrecen comida diseñada para hurones ya que reconocen sus especificas necesidades alimentarias .
los hurones son carnivoros , y los alimentos atraviensan el sistema digestivo muy velozmente .
asimismo les faltan de la capacidad de obtener nutrientes de la materia vegetal . por lo que es fundamental que la dieta de tu mascota incluya muchas proteinas , grasas y poca fibra.debe que tener sumo cuidado con lo que se alimenta su huron ya que todos los alimentos no son iguales , incluyendo los que son destinados solo para hurones .

hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .

nosotros somos lo que comemos , esto es valido también para los gatos que requieren de nosotros en cuanto a albergue y comida .

antes de seguir hay que cubrir algunos de los conceptos basicos , esto ayudara a lograr el objetivo de este articulo que es simplificarte la seleccion de la comida para gatos , enseñando a leer el rotulo de los piensos para gatos .

proteina de la carne , el pescado o aves de corral eso es lo que debe saber basicamente , aunque los gatos no necesitan hidratos de carbono , el maiz , el trigo y / o el arroz se utilizan como material de relleno para los alimentos enlatados y pienso gatos .
otros componentes , tales como aglutinantes , aromatizantes y colorantes , los fabricantes de comida para gato los añaden para satisfacer las exigencias esteticas de los compradores .
la comida enlatada no debe permanecer gran tiempo fuera aunque los preservativos utilizados mantengan los alimentos frescos para nuestros gatos .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

esto se debe a las chinchillas , como todos los roedores , tienen dientes que crecen de forma continuada por la vida .
estos dientes deben ser continuamente desgastado al roer .
asegúrese de que hay un montón de mordedores para chinchilla .
al ser mascotas activos , las chinchillas requieren una jaula para chinchillas extensa , espaciosa , ideal con multiples pisos . lo ideal es que haya una jaula configurado y listo antes de transladar su casa chinchilla , para hacer la cambio a su casa mucho mas facil . ademas de la jaula , tendra accesorios , incluyendo una caja nido , botella de agua , banio de polvo , y algunos juguetes para masticar .
el bano de polvo solo debe ponerse a disposicion de la chinchilla de forma alternadamente para que la misma pueda preservar su gruesa piel en forma optima.tenga en cuenta que no es recomendable proveer un bano de agua a una chinchilla esto no solo ayudara a revolcarse en el polvo para concervar su piel tersa y sedosa de espesor , que se cree que es relajante y divertido para chinchillas . otros polvos o granos de arena pueden verse o sentirse similar , pero no va a desempenarse de la igual forma - el polvo de chinchilla se hace para imitar lo que se tiene acceso en su habitat natural .

thursday ’ s event was a chance to meet sullivan and hear about the experiences that he has had during the course of his writing and traveling .
“ i wanted to go the creative and freelance route .
so i got a creative writing degree from cornel , ” he said .
he was not naïve , however .
sullivan said that writing “ does help to keep the day job .
there are not a lot of opportunities out there , and freelance writing can be just as stressful as journalism . ”
and so he was forced to start writing as a freelance journalist , providing occasional articles for various newspapers .
it was not lucrative .
sullivan also encouraged the use of similes and metaphors : “ it ’ s true you can overdo these , but they can also be fun to do .
it ’ s really important you make sure you use the right metaphor for what you are talking about , though . ”
he said he was confident about his knowledge of the state ’ s geography , but he does not often write with a descriptive tone .
bill mccoy , a chemeketa student , said he attended because he has a “ love for nature and a love of exploring nature , and i want to become better at describing my experiences to family and friends . ”

the result is a new area called the veteran & # 8217 ; s lounge .
future plans call for the additions of a computer and a mini-fridge .
cindy ramey , a second-year chemeketa student , is one of the users of the lounge .
ramey was in the military for nearly eight years , serving two tours in iraq .
“ i love that we have a place to go to get away from the chaos of other students .
sometimes it is too much to be around so many people where it can get be really loud , ” she said . & # 8220 ; i love that i can go into the lounge [ and ] do my homework in peace and quiet . ” • shortstop gecy bowman who led the storm in batting average ( .396 ) , homeruns ( 8 ) , and was second in runs batted in ( 21 ) • pitcher kristina meza who had the lowest earned run average in the team last season ( 4.67 ) • sophomore pitcher carrie bess who led all chemeketa pitchers in wins and strikeouts while having an era of 6.24 . • sophomore third basemen danielle upton who had 4 homeruns last year and an rbi of 21 .

as an attention-getter , the presenter ’ s line was effective and immediately got the attention of his audience : so what do you do if you find yourself in an active shooter situation , like the one at the clackamas town center mall in december ?
if you cannot get out , your next option is to lock the shooter out .
“ lock the door if you can .
stack a bunch of furniture ; make a barricade in front of the door .
make it hard for him to come in .
silence you cell phone .
turn off anything making noise .
you don ’ t want him to know you are there . ”
if getting out safely is not an option , and if locking yourself in a safe place fails , it ’ s possible that you will be forced to go face to face with the shooter .
“ get mad .
he is there to kill you .
he has killed all of your colleagues .
in the hallway you can hear the screams of the dying .
you have to fight to survive .
you have to get your plan in motion . ”
demonstrating with a fire extinguisher in his hands , abu-hamid said , “ this is my new best friend .
i am going to aim it and shoot it in his face , ” deploying a distraction technique . ” then i am going to … ” he waited for the response from the people in the audience , and they didn ’ t disappoint .
“ one person per limb ; hands and arms are the priority .
get the hands or arms first .
let gravity do the work , ” taking the shooter to the ground .
“ he is going to be our bad guy , ” abu-hamid said of spenner .
pointing to a partition of curtains in the room , he said , “ this is going to be our doorway .
clem is going to be coming through .
clem knows what is going to be waiting for him on the other side , right ? ”
“ now remember : when he comes through that door , how are you guys going to be set up ? … we want different angles , and close . we are going to deploy the distraction technique .
i want you to wait until you see the whites of his eyes .
wait until he is through the threshold , ” he said .
“ he is going to try and shoot as many of you as possible .
you are going to deploy the distraction technique .
what part of the body are you aiming for ? ”
“ then what are you going to do immediately after that ?
you are going to be deploying and moving in .
grab a limb .
the moment that you touch clem , i am going to yell freeze . ”
“ ok , i am going to take clem in the back and get him set up .
i am going to be the first guy through the door .
don ’ t hurt me .
the second guy through is going to be your shooter , ” he said .
when officer clem crossed the threshold , he was pummeled by the lightweight plastic balls .
before he had a chance to recover , the volunteers were all over him and he was incapacitated .
“ i saw this , ” clem said , indicating those volunteers who had been directly in front of him .
“ i did not see this , ” pointing to the rest of the volunteers .
“ perfect , that ’ s it , ” abu-hamid said .
“ he didn ’ t even have a chance .
he was able to shoot you in the leg , much better than being shot in the back of the head .
a lot of the time they do not even get one shot off .
“ we have one of the most senior [ law enforcement ] guys in the room – definitely one the best trained – and you guys beat him .
you guys won .
i did not tell him to put two rounds in the ground ; i didn ’ t tell him to do that .
i told him , ‘ you are going lose . ’ ” questions about the training sessions should be directed to kohlmeyer at 503-399-6505 .

( editor ’ s note : this is the first of a two part series on williamson ’ s historic win over arch rival logan in the class aaa sectional tournament at the fieldhouse . )
it was a long tip-in from the right side of the goal at the williamson fieldhouse .
hatcher had been on the bench , but was placed in the game by his coach , who had confidence in his abilities .
but what a lot of fans might not know , boo hatcher was nervous .
“ i told jimmy ( barker ) ‘ i ’ m scared , ’ but once i got into the game , i was okay and settled down . ”
another key play was a steal by williamson ’ s jimmy barker , who passed the roundball to donald hairston , who drove the lane and tied the game at 62-all .
logan ’ s steve zappia went to the line for a bonus free throw situation , but missed the front end of the one and one .
barkers ’ shot was long , but boo hatcher was in the right place at the right time .
moments later the hundreds of fans wearing maroon and white rushed the floor .
( this writer was one of those 4,000-plus fans and one of those who celebrated the wolfpack victory on the court . )
boo hatcher and his teammates were mobbed and the historic williamson fieldhouse erupted into a frenzy of exultation .
“ at that time – i wasn ’ t sure what happened , ” boo hatcher remembers .
“ then i saw the fans rush the court and i realized we had won the game . ”
“ i ran straight to the locker room , ” he recalls .
there he continued to receive a long line of congratulations from fans and former wolfpack players .
at that moment it was almost surreal for the whs guard .
coach hatcher ( no relation to the player ) , said he had been “ extremely tough on boo boo ” the day before in practice .
boo hatcher also recalled that he and his coach had gotten into an argument in practice just the day before .
“ he was one of the toughest players i ever had , ” coach hatcher said .
“ he was the glue that held our team together .
that was just the kind of relationship we had . ”
williamson and logan had been two of the top rated class aaa programs in the state for many years .
in the late 1960s , whs held the edge , but then logan turned the tide in the 1970s and had beaten the wolfpack in 10 straight sectional tournaments .
but it was boo hatcher ’ s shot that turned things around with his memorable tip-in .
hatcher now is an assistant coach at mingo central and also the head coach for the girls at williamson middle school .
his son julius iv is a starting junior guard for the miners .
many of the younger generation has no idea of the legacy that hatcher left at williamson .

there ’ s something to be said for holding down the same job for years .
it gives one a sense of continuity and commitment to the job that cannot be disputed .
that ’ s the way it has been for jud hale ( “ please remember it ’ s spelled with just one ‘ d ’ ” , he reminds me ) .
jud has been a part of yankee magazine and the old farmer ’ s almanac for many years and he has no plans to retire .
“ as long as i can make it up the stairs , i will be here , ” he laughs as he describes the route to his office at yankee publishing in dublin , nh .
jud landed the job at yankee ( “ my first job was to take out the trash and make up reader letters , ” he says ) after he got out of the army .
“ i was looking for a job and my mother said to call her brother robb ; he ran a little magazine called yankee and he might find a job for me .
“ uncle robb hired me , ” he continues , “ and i expected i would be at the magazine for no more than a year .
but i got married and i loved the area .
the job turned into a career and then it turned into my life . ”
on his deathbed robb called his son-in-law , rob trowbridge , and his nephew jud to share important news .
he told rob to take over the business side of yankee and jud would handle the editorial end of things .
it was then that jud became the editor of yankee and the old farmer ’ s almanac .
“ he told us not to grow the company any larger , ” jud remembers . “ when we asked him why , he said because the plumbing wouldn ’ t take it ! ”
and what about the time when he can ’ t make it up those office stairs any longer ?
( jud laughs when it ’ s pointed out to him he just might not be 21 any longer ! )
the event also is meant to celebrate the life and work of scotland ’ s greatest poet robert burns on the anniversary of his birth in 1759 .
before his death at the age of 37 , burns had written close to 600 poems and songs .
one of his better-known works is “ auld lang syne . ”

“ in 2002 , i was deployed to the pentagon for a year as a member of the national guard , ” bruce recalls .
“ afterwards , we relocated and moved up to holderness where we had bought some property and built a house . my wife , who was a knitter , was interested in learning to spin , and one mother ’ s day weekend about six or seven years ago , we went over to hopkinton to attend the new hampshire sheep and wool festival . there were some alpacas at the festival , and when we felt the fleece , we liked the softness of it . i then bought my wife a spinner for her birthday . ”
“ what we intended to do originally was to breed the animals and sell them , ” bruce continues . “ but then the economy tanked , so we have shifted our focus to agricultural fairs and alpaca festivals , as well as doing more commercially with the fleece , which is valued for its softness and warmth , and unlike the wool from sheep , alpaca fleece has no lanolin , so it is also hypo-allergenic . ”
the alpacas get shorn every may , when the fleece has grown to about four inches thick . “ we have a professional come in to shear off the fleece and bag it into firsts , seconds , and thirds , ” bruce says . “ the seconds and thirds , which are shorn from the animal ’ s neck and legs , are sent off to the new england alpaca fiber pool for credits to use to buy products that they make , such as mittens , hats , and so on .
