but was it a push poll ?
big news : with baucus retirement , wyden poised for finance chair now , the question i 've got is this : was it a push poll ?
i haven 't heard a recording of it , but by the looks of my facebook newsfeed , the call went to a lot of people -- not just the few thousand required to get a 400 or 500 -sample poll .
so , anti-fluoride campaign , do you have any answers for us ?
and blueoregon readers , tell us : did you get the wichita fluoride call ?
permalink : a big waste of money .
but was it a push poll ?
for those of us who are civically engaged , it might be a surprise that public water fluoridation isn ’ t the biggest controversy to hit portland this spring .
it ’ s a position that is at best negligent and at worst bigoted , and it implies these organizations and communities are either intellectually incapable of making evidence-based decisions or are so naïve and unsophisticated that they ’ ll believe anything .
lawmakers are quick to point out that no one would be forced to say the pledge ; that students could sit it out .
and to this i say , with all due respect -- are you fricking kidding me ?
there are lots of implications of that , but the big one for oregonians is what it means for senator ron wyden .
“ i just heard these press reports , and i ’ m not going to comment on them in any way .
all i ’ ve heard are press reports .
i am not going to comment in any way this morning . ”
ron wyden is wonkish , optimistic , idiosyncratic — and about to be very powerful ...
if baucus annoyed democrats for being too cautious , wyden will annoy them by being too ambitious — and too ceaselessly interested in brokering big , bipartisan deals .
on monday , senator betsy johnson ( d-scappoose ) was badly injured in a car accident on the way to the capitol , breaking her pelvis .

in the six biggest eu countries confidence in the eu and its institutions has fallen dramatically .
the guardian speaks of a vertiginous decline .
here the results : wolfgang munchau says jose manual barroso should not have emphasized the social effects of austerity in member states , but taken the perspective of the eurozone as a whole ; iu is closer to both greece 's syriza and germany 's die linke .
a large number of european media are leading with comments by jose manuel barroso according to which he signalled a change in the eu ’ s demand for austerity policies .
" while i think this policy is fundamentally right , i think it has reached its limits . " he is quoted as saying , adding that for a policy to work , it would require a minimum of political and social support .
in its coverage of the story , the ft linked the policy reversal to the outcome of the italian elections , the recession and the re-assessment of reinhart-rogoff .
as we pointed out at the time , the fundamental problem is the fiscal pact , which is the ultimate cause for all this pro-cyclicality .
the commission has some leeway in implementing the policies , but not enough power to reverse them .
for the eurozone as a whole , which is what matters the most , a policy reversal would have to include a readiness by germany to expand its fiscal policies .
the opposite is happening .
this is what mr barroso and olli rehn should address .

blackjack är ett populärt spel som har sina rötter i kortspelet 21 , ett hasardspel som spelats i flera hundra år i europa .
oavsett om man spelar blackjack eller 21 är målet att komma närmare 21 poäng än vad dealern gör .
när du spelar blackjack får du två kort som starthand , och det är sedan upp till dig att avgöra om du vill ha fler kort .
du får ett kort i taget ( öppet ) och kan när som helst välja att säga stopp och nöja dig med de kort du har .
går din hand över 21 poäng har den automatiskt förlorat och tas ur spel , och du förlorar omedelbart din insats .
eftersom det viktiga inte är att komma nära 21 poäng utan att komma närmare 21 poäng än dealern finns det situationer där det kan vara bäst att stanna och vägra ta fler kort trots att ens hand har en mycket låg poäng .
exakt hur utbetalningar ser ut beror på vilket blackjackbord du spelar vid , men här är exempel på regler som gäller i en lång rad internationella casinon : en blackjack vinner över en hand som är värd 21 poäng utan att vara blackjack .
om du kommer närmare 21 poäng än dealern på annat sätt än genom blackjack vinner du 1 gång din insats .
om du och dealern får samma poängsumma vinner du inte något , men du förlorar inte heller din insats .
om dealern kommer närmare 21 poäng än vad du gör förlorar du din insats .
om du får 22 poäng eller mer förlorar du din insats , oavsett hur det sedan går för dealerns hand .

jedoch ist es bestimmt jedem schon einmal passiert , dass er sein lieblingsshirt an einer anderen person gesehen hat .
hier wünscht man sich , ein eigenes , individuelles shirt , welches man nur selbst besitzt .
sicherheitsschuhe sind stiefel oder halbschuhe , welche zum schutz getragen werden .
sie werden oft auch von beispielsweise berufsgenossenschaften vorgeschrieben .
zum einsatz kommen sicherheitsschuhe vor allem im bauwesen , in der industrie , im garten- und landschaftsbau , im rettungsdienst , bei der feuerwehr oder dem technischen hilfswerk .
sicherheitsschuhe haben am vorderen teil eine schutzkappe aus kunststoff oder metall , welche für den schutz der zehen vorgesehen ist .
das obermaterial ist meist aus leder und die sohle aus pu , gummi oder thermoplastischen elastomeren .
die chronische hyperglykämie bezeichnet man als diabetes mellitus , im volksmund auch als zuckerkrankheit bekannt .
es werden verschiedene formen der krankheit unterschieden , je nach der ursache der entstehung .

die betroffenen gebiete befinden sich grundsätzlich auf dem weg der besserung .

im mittelalter trug die bauersfrau im wesentlichen lange einfach genähte kleider aus selbst gewebtem leinen stoff .
manchmal färbte man ihn mit naturfarben ein , die man aus blaubeeren , spinat roten rüben , walnuss schalen oder safran gewann .
unterwäsche trug man kaum außer in sehr kalten monaten ein hemd aus wolle oder leinen .
im sommer ging frau barfuß , im winter trug sie meist bund schuhe aus selbst gegerbtem leder , umwickelt mit hanfseil oder holz pantinen mit socken aus selbst geschorener , selbst gesponnener und selbst gestrickter schafwolle .
der adel ließ sich damals bald seine kleidung aus von der ferne eingeführter seide weben und kunstvoll anfertigen .
auch samt aus china wurde herangeschafft und zu schönen , langen bestickten und mit perlen genähten kleidern verarbeitet .
dazu trugen die damen bei hofe oft eine schleppe und einen kunstvoll genähten umhang .

es kontrolliert praktisch die beiden mittelmeerbecken und streckt sich europa entgegen .
die entfernung nach sizilien beträgt 140 km .
1300 kilometer küste , oft sandstrandig , verbinden tunesien mit dem mittelmeer .
außer seinen natürlichen grenzen im norden und osten wird tunesien von seinen beiden nachbarstaaten algerien im westen und südwesten , libyen im äußersten süden wie von einer geliebten umarmt .
seine fläche beträgt kaum mehr als 164 000 km ² , seine durchschnittliche breite 240 km und seine maximale länge 800 km .
tunesien erstaunt den besucher durch die vielfältigkeit seiner landschaft .
der norden ist einerseits von einer mit pinienwäldern sowie mit eichen bewachsenen bergkette geschmückt , andererseits breiten sich fruchtbare ebenen aus , die zum großteil von zwei wasserläufen , dem qued mejerda und dem qued meliane bewässert werden .
die quelle des ersten liegt in algerien , die des zweiten am jebel bargou in der nähe von siliana .

lo que tiene que fijase al elegir una jaula son que los pisos sean fuertes lo mismo con los estantes , escaleras y balcones , pero tenga cuidado con la malla de alambre que pueden ser dificultoso para sus pies .
son buenas las jaulas con varios niveles pero estos tienen que estar distribuidas bien ya que los hurones se pueden caer.comprar estantes extras o hamacas para hacer las jaulas mas seguras puede ser prudente .
comprar un huron puede ser dificil en algunos momentos .
la mejor manera de crear un lugar seguro cuando usted es incapaz de supervisar las actividades de su huron es una jaula de huron .

hay que tener cuidado a la hora de comprar una jaula para hamster ya que la jaula puede ser dificil para ellos .
por el otro lado , hamsters enanos a menudo se puede exprimir a traves de los barrotes de una jaula hamster promedio .
hay muchas jaulas para hamsters , pero hay muchos factores a considerar al obtener una jaula para hamster sirio .
por ejemplo uno de los factores a la hora de obtener es ver que la jaula sea amplia y segura para el hamster ademas de que sea comodo de limpiar . desafortunadamente , muchas jaulas que encontrara en la tienda de mascotas no cumplen con todos estos requisitos cuando se trata de sirio ( oso de oro , de peluche , oso negro ) hamsters .
las alternativas que podras encontrar son una jaula de plastico modular ( con muchos compartimentos y tubos ) , una jaula de alambre ( que generalmente viene con un piso de plastico ) o un acuario ( con una tapa de malla de seguridad .
los distintos tipos de jaulas tiene sus pro y sus contras .

nosotros somos lo que comemos , esto es valido también para los gatos que requieren de nosotros en cuanto a albergue y comida .
de hecho , la comida para gatos es lo mas primordial en el cuidado del felino , junto con las visitas a veterinarios .

antes de seguir hay que cubrir algunos de los conceptos basicos , esto ayudara a lograr el objetivo de este articulo que es simplificarte la seleccion de la comida para gatos , enseñando a leer el rotulo de los piensos para gatos .
lo que tiene que conocer de las necesidades nutricionales esenciales de los gatos .
proteina de la carne , el pescado o aves de corral eso es lo que debe saber basicamente , aunque los gatos no necesitan hidratos de carbono , el maiz , el trigo y / o el arroz se utilizan como material de relleno para los alimentos enlatados y pienso gatos .
otros componentes , tales como aglutinantes , aromatizantes y colorantes , los fabricantes de comida para gato los añaden para satisfacer las exigencias esteticas de los compradores .
la comida enlatada no debe permanecer gran tiempo fuera aunque los preservativos utilizados mantengan los alimentos frescos para nuestros gatos .
las cobayas son animales sociales por lo que tenemos que procurar preservarlos en grupos de por lo menos dos o mas .
pero las jaulas para cobayas comerciales mas facilmente disponibles no son lo bastante espaciosas como para albergar a un par de cobayas . la guia de dos metros cuadrados por cobaya ya no se usa .
es recomiendable tener una jaula de 2.2 metros cuadrados para una sola cobaya y 3.2 metros para 2 cobayas .
pero con una jaula con espacio adicional , tu cobaya te lo va a agradecer ya que estara mas comoda .
hay que obviar en la medida de lo posible las jaulas con suelo de alambe o rampas de cable ya que pueden lastimar muy gravemente a las cobayas .
a las cobayas les encanta las jaulas con rampas y bajo estantes de plastico tambien les encantan las repisas .
el espacio entre las barras puede ser de hasta una pulgada para los adultos .
lo bueno de las cobayas es que son suficientemente grandes y no tan grandes en la escalada o la masticacion , y no es factible suban o salten por encima de una pared que es la altura razonable ( 18 pulgadas debe contener la mayoria de las cobayas ) .
posees a tu disposicion muchas jaulas cobayas .
las cobayas necesitan una jaula para cobaya con un fondo solido a diferencia de los conejos .
jaulas con piso de alambre no son correctas , y puede resultar en lesiones graves a su cobaya . si usted tiene gatos u otros animales depredadores en su hogar es una buena idea tener una jaula cobaya con una tapa segura para preservara su cobaya .
la falta de vitamina c puede probocar escorbuto a las cobayas , por lo que deben recibir esta vitamina a diario para mantener una buena salud ya que su cuerpo no la produce .
para perseverar una buena alimentación cada cobaya se debe dar 10mgs de vitamina c por dia para 1 kg de peso corporal .
se puede obtener en muchos lados comida para cobayas que viene con un complemento de vitamina c. sin embargo , esto no se aconseja que la comida para cobayas sea la única fuente de vitamina c de tu cobaya .
darles a las cobayas hortalizas diariamente no puede ser reemplazado por ninguna comida para cobayas o alimentos que se pueden encontrar en el mercado .
ellos no están tan entunciasmadas cuando les dejo un plato de comida cobaya seca como lo hacen cuando les ofrezco una mezcla de todos sus vegetales favoritos .
todo lo que usted quiere saber antes de elegir una jaula para ardillas lo que se debe tener en cuenta es que si bien las ardillas coreanas no son animales grandes , deben poseer suficiente espacio para correr y trepar . sin embargo , el espacio vertical es mas importante que la superficie , por lo que una jaula de altura es lapreferible . como minimo la jaula para ardillas deberia tener 60 cm de alto y 20 cm de largo y ancho . si la jaula para ardilla es de alambre debe tener una malla con espacio estrecho ( 1cm como maximo ) . si la jaula que ha adquirido es de madera o de plastico , debe cubrirla con alambre , ya que las ardillas son extraordinarias masticadoras y van a masticar la jaula para huir de la jaula . la jaula es apta si posee un piso de 2 pies por 2 pies pero lo importante es la altura .
hay que colocarle ramas en la jaula , para escalar y masticar .
las cuerdas de algodon pendiendo en la jaula son chances para la escalada y el entretenimiento tambien . junto a la caja para el nido deben agregarse pañuelos tissue o toallitas de papel para que al confeccionar el nido nolastimensus piernas con algun material que las forre . no se puede facilitar virutas de madera en la parte inferior de la jaula , ya que lo apto para los roedores es forrarlo con sabana o cama .
el agua puede ser entregada en un tazon de cuello abierta bajo para ardillas .
como se menciono anteriormente , las ramas se pueden ser utilizadas como juguetes para masticar , como piezas de madera , juguetes de madera de loro , etc integrales , las nueces de cascara dura tambien son oportunidades de mascar asi como exquisitos bocadillos .
se aconseja tener una rueda de ejercicios en las jaulas para ardillas para que se mantenga saludable . una opcion confiable es proporcionar una rueda de superficie solida como lo es la rueda de wodent .
que debe condiderar al momento de seleccionar la comida para ardillas .
la alimentacion de las ardillas se basa en los frutos y semillas que pueden localizar en su medio ambiente natural . cuando las ardillas estan en cautividad se les deben proporcionar estos alimentos .
las ardillas son susceptibles a la deficiencia de calcio , por lo que se recomienda comprar comida para ardillas con suplemento de calcio y vitamina d3 ( fundamental en el metabolismo del calcio ) . de la misma forma comida y articulos que contengan mucho fosforo anionicos deben ser reducidos .

usted debe garantizar de no ofrecerle a las aves nueces o semillas , sino que se le debe ofrecer comida para pajaros con gran valor nutricional .

siempre y cuando su perico tenga cariño , buena comida y los cuidados apropiados , se va a transformar en uno de los preferidos amigos en su hogar .
siempre que la dieta no sea unicamente de semillas sera buena para los pericos .
que su periquito ingiera semillas todos los dias es comparable a que usted coma carne en todas las comidas , esto no es saludable a largo plazo .

en el mercado hay ofrecidas un millon de jaulas que no son las aconsejadas para los conejos .
algunas son demasiado pequeñas , y muchas tienen pisos de alambre , que puede hacer la limpieza mas sencillo , pero que no brindan mucho consuelo para el conejo .
generalmente , mas grande es mejor .
si su conejo se pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo en una jaula , entonces , es mejor obtener la jaula mas amplia que sea practico en el hogar .
una guia util es calcular el tamaño de la jaula como veces el medida de tu conejo .
para los conejos grandes de mas de 8 kilos se aconseja una jaula de 30 " por 36 " y para los mas chicos una de 24 " por 36 " van bien .
asi mismo las jaulas conejos que tienen pisos y rampas que une a estos niveles suelen agradarles mucho a los conejos .
una de las cosas a remarcar es que la puerta debe ser lo bastante grande como para sacar al conejo y poder limpiar el lecho de arena .
una puerta lateral es posiblemente el mejor , como una primera abertura de la jaula hace que adquirir el conejo y un poco mas dificultoso ( y lo mejor es que el conejo pueda entrar y salir por su cuenta ) .
es vital revisar que la entrada tenga los rebordes lisos o cubiertos de plastico para evitar que el conejo o tu s lastimen .
todo lo que necesitas entender sobre como alimentar a tu conejo un saludable sistema digestivo depende de cuanta fibra su conejo ingiera .
la mayor parte de la dieta de los conejos comesticos consiste en heno de hierba frezca y hortalizas .

que debo conocer sobre las chinchillas como mascotas y sus mordedores ?
antes de decidirse por una chinchilla como animal domestico , tiene informarse con sus caracteristicas distintivas y todas las facetas para su cuidado .
aqui hallara toda lainformacion y una guia de como tener cuidado una chinchilla , que cuidados debe tener , y cuales son los accesorios inpresindibles para manteneren la casa para una chinchilla .
con un manejo reposado desde una temprana edad la mayoria de las chinchillas se hara muy sumisas y estaran cerca con sus propietarios , aunque a veces no les gusta que se carguen o los abracen .
las chinchillas pueden encontrarse solas o juntas , pero de estar con otra chinchilla es recomendable que sean del mismo sexo , o hermanas o que esten juntas desde una temprana edad .
las chinchillas son muy energicas y vivarachas .
sus habitos son nocturnos , por lo que las chinchillas son mucho mas energicas durante la noche . los picos mas altos de actividad son durante cuando esta amaneciendo o durante el atardecer , por lo que se le suele llamar crepuscular . de todas maneras , deben ponerse en una zona bastante pasificadurante el dia .
los habitosy tener horarios para la alimentacion es muy importante ya que las mismas se estresan si hay cambios en su rutina diaria .
ya que las chinchillas son muy activas y les gusta jugar , necesitan su sitio para realizar ejercicio por lo que la jaulas chinchillas debe ser grande . para las chinchillas provenientes de temperaturas frias se deben tener cuidados de no ubicarlas en lugares muy calidos ya que el exeso de temperaturas les puede perjudicar .
para atesorar a las chinchillas sanas , una buena y euilibrado regimen de calidad es sumamente necesario . su sistema digestivo esta diseniado para comida para chinchillas con mucha fibra , por lo que una buena dieta debe tener mucha fibra y un monton de heno para chinchillas que es una hierba . una dieta inapropiada puede causar graves desordenes estomacales y contratiempo de salud . como algunas personas , las chinchillas tienen un diente dulce y pueden anteponeralimentarse cosas que no son oportunas para ellos por lo que se debe usar con cuidado . las chinchillas requieren una gran cantidad de forraje , y el regimen ante todo debe estar consistido de una hierba de heno de buena calidad , junto con bolitas elaboradas de chinchillas una cucharadita por dia en total . el sistema digestivo de las chinchillas es bastante perceptivo por lo que cualquier modificacion en el regimen debe ser gradual . las hermosas chinchillas tienen un deseo insaciable de roer .
esto se debe a las chinchillas , como todos los roedores , tienen dientes que crecen de forma continuada por la vida .
estos dientes deben ser continuamente desgastado al roer .
asegúrese de que hay un montón de mordedores para chinchilla .
al ser mascotas activos , las chinchillas requieren una jaula para chinchillas extensa , espaciosa , ideal con multiples pisos . lo ideal es que haya una jaula configurado y listo antes de transladar su casa chinchilla , para hacer la cambio a su casa mucho mas facil . ademas de la jaula , tendra accesorios , incluyendo una caja nido , botella de agua , banio de polvo , y algunos juguetes para masticar .
el bano de polvo solo debe ponerse a disposicion de la chinchilla de forma alternadamente para que la misma pueda preservar su gruesa piel en forma optima.tenga en cuenta que no es recomendable proveer un bano de agua a una chinchilla esto no solo ayudara a revolcarse en el polvo para concervar su piel tersa y sedosa de espesor , que se cree que es relajante y divertido para chinchillas . otros polvos o granos de arena pueden verse o sentirse similar , pero no va a desempenarse de la igual forma - el polvo de chinchilla se hace para imitar lo que se tiene acceso en su habitat natural .

and even though we struggled at times , i am so proud of how hard we fought and competed , and how mentally tough we were . ”
“ it was a struggle for us for 33 minutes , ” abderhalden said , perhaps understating the depth of the hole that chemeketa was in at the time .
but the storm put on a full-court press that stifled big bend .
chemeketa , which forced 21 turnovers during the course of the game , initiated a couple of key stops , hit a couple of threes , and went on a 27- 5 run to end up with a thrilling win .
begin hit the three that put the storm on top by one point with 40 seconds to go , and big bend , facing a smothering defense , couldn & # 8217 ; t get a basket in its final possession .
a runner from kauffman , a lay-up by phillips , and threes by batey and molan then put the storm on top .
edmonds began to heat up from the field , however , and they surged back to tie the game as time was running down .
momentum shifted once more as edmonds came roaring out of the box with a 14-2 run to start the second half .
batey converts a three-point-play , and he did so again midway through the second half of a backcourt steal .
then begin connected on a short jumper and came up with a steal and a flashy pass to batey for the lay-in .
chemeketa called a timeout to set-up a play that worked to perfection .
howard was able to beat his man off the dribble and get the bucket with 40 seconds remaining .
“ it was so awesome to win because of all the adversity we have overcome this season , ” molan said .
“ our goal at the start of the season was to win the nwacc title , and it was so great to play for each other and achieve that goal together . ”
molan was selected to the second team , batey was named to the first team , and phillips was named tournament mvp .
starr , who also serves as the adviser to the group , was initially responsible for bringing brito into the asc fold .
brito says , “ i was doing homework by the office when peter approached me .
we started talking , and then he asked me if i wanted a job as an asc .
i sat through an interview , filled out an application , and got the job . ”
starr says , “ one of the things asc members do a really good job of is voter registration .
we were able to register a ton of students to vote this year .
our purpose was to educate students why voting is vital .
“ i also thought our asc members did a great job of informing people about candidates without misinforming or angling the information . ”
brito says , “ we try to focus on local politics that are usually education-based .
our job is basically to fight for students here . ”
but thanks to a petition and a vote by the members of the asc , the proposal was not pursued .
in that case , at least , “ we were put in a position to lead , ” asc member aaron tagabuel says .
and the members of the asc seem to be a big fan of their boss .
“ he is a no-nonsense kind of a guy , but he is a joker at the same time , ” tagabuel says .
brito says , “ he is a really good mentor , and he is one of the chillest guys you will ever meet .
the other day we played hackie sack for 20 minutes with our boss .
who else does that with their superior ? ”
look at the picture of the asc members on the group & # 8217 ; s brochure and you & # 8217 ; ll see peopleof many different races and ethnicities .
“ we want to try to be as approachable as we possibly can to make students feel comfortable talking with us , ” brito says .
“ writing is like sex .
first you do it for love , then for friends , and finally for money . ”
thursday ’ s event was a chance to meet sullivan and hear about the experiences that he has had during the course of his writing and traveling .
“ i wanted to go the creative and freelance route .
so i got a creative writing degree from cornel , ” he said .
he was not naïve , however .
sullivan said that writing “ does help to keep the day job .
there are not a lot of opportunities out there , and freelance writing can be just as stressful as journalism . ”
and so he was forced to start writing as a freelance journalist , providing occasional articles for various newspapers .
it was not lucrative .
sullivan also encouraged the use of similes and metaphors : “ it ’ s true you can overdo these , but they can also be fun to do .
it ’ s really important you make sure you use the right metaphor for what you are talking about , though . ”
he said he was confident about his knowledge of the state ’ s geography , but he does not often write with a descriptive tone .
bill mccoy , a chemeketa student , said he attended because he has a “ love for nature and a love of exploring nature , and i want to become better at describing my experiences to family and friends . ”
“ i get to go hiking for a living .
i really enjoy it , ” he said .
the result is a new area called the veteran & # 8217 ; s lounge .
future plans call for the additions of a computer and a mini-fridge .
cindy ramey , a second-year chemeketa student , is one of the users of the lounge .
ramey was in the military for nearly eight years , serving two tours in iraq .
“ i love that we have a place to go to get away from the chaos of other students .
sometimes it is too much to be around so many people where it can get be really loud , ” she said . & # 8220 ; i love that i can go into the lounge [ and ] do my homework in peace and quiet . ” • shortstop gecy bowman who led the storm in batting average ( .396 ) , homeruns ( 8 ) , and was second in runs batted in ( 21 ) • pitcher kristina meza who had the lowest earned run average in the team last season ( 4.67 ) • sophomore pitcher carrie bess who led all chemeketa pitchers in wins and strikeouts while having an era of 6.24 . • sophomore third basemen danielle upton who had 4 homeruns last year and an rbi of 21 .
it wasn ’ t all that long ago that the lines on the first day of the winter term went right out the financial aid office door and down a hallway .
the reason is that they can add up quickly and take a long time to repay .
