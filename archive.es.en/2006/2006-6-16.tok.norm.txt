in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .

" there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 16.06.2006 dutch to counter ivory coast threat with rampaging robben großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will again spearhead the dutch attack as they aim to make the second round the netherlands go into friday 's group c match against ivory coast seeking a win that would almost certainly book their passage into the second round of the world cup . after recording a vital 1-0 win over serbia and montenegro on sunday , the dutch will be hoping for a repeat of the inexperience the young west africans showed in their 2-1 loss to argentina in their opener . " in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to . " " we have to work on our strengths and weaknesses , and while we are in a less comfortable situation -lrb- after the argentina loss -rrb- , i still say we can beat the dutch . " dutch winger the man to watch as ivory coast fight to survive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben 's speed and agility undid serbia & montenegro ivory coast striker arouna kone , who has spent three seasons in the dutch league - the last with psv eindhoven , has earmarked left winger arjen robben as the dangerman . robben turned in a scintillating , goal-scoring , man-of-the-match performance against serbia and montenegro , and kone said : " robben is probably the most important player in their team .
in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win . " dutch coach marco van basten added : " they have a lot of good players , experienced players who play in big competitions in england and spain so they are very strong . " " we saw their games in the african nations cup -lrb- where they lost in the final -rrb- , and we know a lot about that .
it will be a tough and very important game for us . " as for the specific threat posed by captain and chelsea striker drogba , van basten was resolute .
" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .

" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .
and technically he can make goals .
but we do n't change everything for one player .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .

" then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2006 eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is being targeted for unfair pricing by the eu the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share . the commission said that the german telecoms regulator bundesnetzagentur should step up price controls to encourage greater competition and ensure consumers are protected from excessive prices charged by dominant operator deutsche telekom .
in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "

as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .

" we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .

" and we will win . " lots of beer and sausages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called fan mile in front of the brandenburg gate business has been particularly brisk on berlin 's so-called " fan mile " - a two-kilometer-long -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- stretch for soccer buffs in the city center that starts right behind the brandenburg gate . the mile boasts several public viewing areas , with street vendors flanking the street .
among other things , they 've already sold one and a half million liters of beer and one and half million german sausages . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forget the title - germany wants an economic boom germany 's influential diw economic research institute released a forecast that the world cup would not significantly aid the country 's economy .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .
" i think we can play even better , and we 'll try and prove it in the next game .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 16.06.2006 dutch victory breaks hearts in ivory coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands earned a spot in the round of 16 with the win with everything at stake in the " group of death , " the ivory coast gave the holland a run for their money throughout a pulsating match that saw seven yellow cards before ending 2-1 in the netherlands ' favor . a sell-out crowd packed the stands of stuttgart 's gottlieb daimler stadium to watch the netherlands take on ivory coast .
the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .
they meet argentina on june 21st to determine the winner of group c. ivory coast , on the other hand , will head home after their last match against serbia-montenegro . dw staff -lrb- cha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch to counter ivory coast threat with rampaging robben the netherlands go into friday 's group c match against ivory coast seeking a win that would almost certainly book their passage into the second round of the world cup .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "

as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "

as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .
" i think we can play even better , and we 'll try and prove it in the next game .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood .

the youngster latched on to the swiftly taken free kick to feed crespo with an inch-perfect cross to crespo for argentina 's fifth carlos tevez , who replaced saviola midway through the second half , dribbled past two defenders and curled his shot past jevric , while messi , hailed as maradona 's heir , marked his return from injury with his first world cup goal in only 15 minutes on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weakened serbia & montenegro ripe for argentinean plucking two-time world cup winners argentina , buoyed by three points from their first game against ivory coast , on friday take on a serbia-montenegro side severely weakened by the loss of defensive pillar nemanja vidic .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before . " there has been a degree of national debate .
but there seems to be less consensus at the moment on what would be the way forward .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before . " there has been a degree of national debate .
but there seems to be less consensus at the moment on what would be the way forward .

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2006 eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still a long way until the eu gets a constitution european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc . wrapping up a two-day summit , leaders remained sharply divided on how the eu should deal with its twin crises of the constitutional treaty and promises for further expansion .
leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .

bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2006 world cup tourists make berlin richer - literally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners have every reason to be happy about the world cup berlin is the german city that 's profiting most economically from the crowds of foreign world cup tourists descending on the country .
aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune . for the cash-strapped german capital , the soccer world cup is a real boon .
with 500,000 new arrivals in the city every day , berlin boasts more visitors than any other city that 's hosting the soccer matches . of the half a million visitors here per day , no fewer than 200,000 stay in hotels and bed-and-breakfast places .
many shops in downtown berlin are registering record turnovers with soccer-related souvenirs selling like hot cakes . " all the guests from foreign countries visiting germany are coming in this shop , " said one street vendor near the brandenburg gate .
" it 's not the german people , it 's just outside people that come in here and they are especially interested in souvenirs for the world championship . " tricky exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian fans may look funny , but they 're bringing much-needed cash to germany an australian tourist nearby , who had accompanied his team to their first world cup in 32 years , was just about to get a feel of the city and find his way around . " i 'm just going around , seeing the sites and eating the wonderful german food , " he said , adding that he is certain that at the end of his stay in berlin his pockets will be much emptier as he only gets about 50 euro cents -lrb- 60 us cents -rrb- for one australian dollar . " we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .
so even with the exchange rate it 's always on par with what i would spend in australia . " 50 million euros per day according to the latest statistics , the ordinary berlin visitor during the world cup spends about 180 euros on average , hotel costs included .
this means that berlin collects some 50 million euros from tourists every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swedes are roughing it , but they do love german beer the swedish tourists , for example , who were in town for thursday 's match pitting their team against paraguay , were certainly willing to add to the windfall .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2006 eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is being targeted for unfair pricing by the eu the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share . the commission said that the german telecoms regulator bundesnetzagentur should step up price controls to encourage greater competition and ensure consumers are protected from excessive prices charged by dominant operator deutsche telekom .
in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune . for the cash-strapped german capital , the soccer world cup is a real boon .
with 500,000 new arrivals in the city every day , berlin boasts more visitors than any other city that 's hosting the soccer matches . of the half a million visitors here per day , no fewer than 200,000 stay in hotels and bed-and-breakfast places .
many shops in downtown berlin are registering record turnovers with soccer-related souvenirs selling like hot cakes . " all the guests from foreign countries visiting germany are coming in this shop , " said one street vendor near the brandenburg gate .
" it 's not the german people , it 's just outside people that come in here and they are especially interested in souvenirs for the world championship . " tricky exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian fans may look funny , but they 're bringing much-needed cash to germany an australian tourist nearby , who had accompanied his team to their first world cup in 32 years , was just about to get a feel of the city and find his way around . " i 'm just going around , seeing the sites and eating the wonderful german food , " he said , adding that he is certain that at the end of his stay in berlin his pockets will be much emptier as he only gets about 50 euro cents -lrb- 60 us cents -rrb- for one australian dollar . " we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .
so even with the exchange rate it 's always on par with what i would spend in australia . " 50 million euros per day according to the latest statistics , the ordinary berlin visitor during the world cup spends about 180 euros on average , hotel costs included .
this means that berlin collects some 50 million euros from tourists every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swedes are roughing it , but they do love german beer the swedish tourists , for example , who were in town for thursday 's match pitting their team against paraguay , were certainly willing to add to the windfall .
but how much money were they willing to spend here ? two hundreds euros , said one man , who was echoed by a female fan . " if we win , we 'll spend more , " said another , adding that he could fork out up to 400 euros .
" and we will win . " lots of beer and sausages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called fan mile in front of the brandenburg gate business has been particularly brisk on berlin 's so-called " fan mile " - a two-kilometer-long -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- stretch for soccer buffs in the city center that starts right behind the brandenburg gate . the mile boasts several public viewing areas , with street vendors flanking the street .
among other things , they 've already sold one and a half million liters of beer and one and half million german sausages . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forget the title - germany wants an economic boom germany 's influential diw economic research institute released a forecast that the world cup would not significantly aid the country 's economy .
yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different .
-lrb- may 21 , 2006 -rrb- germany launches world cup charm offensive germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face .

but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .

the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .

the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen .

she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2006 beloved west berlin landmark begins rapid decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station , once a bustling hub , is now a shadow of its former self berlin 's new main rail station opened at the end of may .
since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2006 eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is being targeted for unfair pricing by the eu the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share . the commission said that the german telecoms regulator bundesnetzagentur should step up price controls to encourage greater competition and ensure consumers are protected from excessive prices charged by dominant operator deutsche telekom .
in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

the youngster latched on to the swiftly taken free kick to feed crespo with an inch-perfect cross to crespo for argentina 's fifth carlos tevez , who replaced saviola midway through the second half , dribbled past two defenders and curled his shot past jevric , while messi , hailed as maradona 's heir , marked his return from injury with his first world cup goal in only 15 minutes on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weakened serbia & montenegro ripe for argentinean plucking two-time world cup winners argentina , buoyed by three points from their first game against ivory coast , on friday take on a serbia-montenegro side severely weakened by the loss of defensive pillar nemanja vidic .

the youngster latched on to the swiftly taken free kick to feed crespo with an inch-perfect cross to crespo for argentina 's fifth carlos tevez , who replaced saviola midway through the second half , dribbled past two defenders and curled his shot past jevric , while messi , hailed as maradona 's heir , marked his return from injury with his first world cup goal in only 15 minutes on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weakened serbia & montenegro ripe for argentinean plucking two-time world cup winners argentina , buoyed by three points from their first game against ivory coast , on friday take on a serbia-montenegro side severely weakened by the loss of defensive pillar nemanja vidic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2006 eu leaders postpone constitution decision until 2008 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still a long way until the eu gets a constitution european union leaders on friday left the bloc 's moribund constitution in limbo until 2008 and set tougher terms for the admission of new member states to the 25-nation bloc . wrapping up a two-day summit , leaders remained sharply divided on how the eu should deal with its twin crises of the constitutional treaty and promises for further expansion .
leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .
-lrb- march 12 , 2006 -rrb- beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- klinsmann gets merkel 's vote of confidence under-fire germany manager jürgen klinsmann received a vote of confidence from an unlikely quarter when chancellor angela merkel told him wednesday she was rooting for him .

the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

" if we begin the match with the same team as that of sunday , we do not have any chance against argentina , " midfielder ognjen koroman said . yet , the serbs have little choice but to pull together and win against one of the strongest teams in germany friday if they want to maintain their chances of qualifying from the " group of death . " by contrast , argentina 's squad - who suffered similar bickering when they failed to get beyond the first round in 2002 and recorded their worst world cup performance in 40 years - are fit , united and focused . " we must be thinking of collecting three points , " said full back roberto ayala , one of argentina 's best players in the 2-1 defeat of ivory coast in hamburg last week .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .
" it is about keeping a part of our city vibrant and convenient . " on with the new across the city , in the once-barren area , a shiny , gigantic station - and the largest in europe - is bustling with travelers and shoppers .
berlin hauptbahnhof is the last of the big construction projects of the city 's post-unification phase - and , many hope , the start of a new chapter for a city which has seen lower population growth than once expected and thus far failed to emerge from its financial doldrums .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before . " there has been a degree of national debate .
but there seems to be less consensus at the moment on what would be the way forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2006 world cup tourists make berlin richer - literally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners have every reason to be happy about the world cup berlin is the german city that 's profiting most economically from the crowds of foreign world cup tourists descending on the country .
aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune . for the cash-strapped german capital , the soccer world cup is a real boon .
with 500,000 new arrivals in the city every day , berlin boasts more visitors than any other city that 's hosting the soccer matches . of the half a million visitors here per day , no fewer than 200,000 stay in hotels and bed-and-breakfast places .
many shops in downtown berlin are registering record turnovers with soccer-related souvenirs selling like hot cakes . " all the guests from foreign countries visiting germany are coming in this shop , " said one street vendor near the brandenburg gate .
" it 's not the german people , it 's just outside people that come in here and they are especially interested in souvenirs for the world championship . " tricky exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian fans may look funny , but they 're bringing much-needed cash to germany an australian tourist nearby , who had accompanied his team to their first world cup in 32 years , was just about to get a feel of the city and find his way around . " i 'm just going around , seeing the sites and eating the wonderful german food , " he said , adding that he is certain that at the end of his stay in berlin his pockets will be much emptier as he only gets about 50 euro cents -lrb- 60 us cents -rrb- for one australian dollar . " we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .
so even with the exchange rate it 's always on par with what i would spend in australia . " 50 million euros per day according to the latest statistics , the ordinary berlin visitor during the world cup spends about 180 euros on average , hotel costs included .
this means that berlin collects some 50 million euros from tourists every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swedes are roughing it , but they do love german beer the swedish tourists , for example , who were in town for thursday 's match pitting their team against paraguay , were certainly willing to add to the windfall .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .

commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .

bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .
" it is about keeping a part of our city vibrant and convenient . " on with the new across the city , in the once-barren area , a shiny , gigantic station - and the largest in europe - is bustling with travelers and shoppers .
berlin hauptbahnhof is the last of the big construction projects of the city 's post-unification phase - and , many hope , the start of a new chapter for a city which has seen lower population growth than once expected and thus far failed to emerge from its financial doldrums . " we had big dreams after the berlin wall fell , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" and with this station , we are hoping to make them more of a reality . " and in that reality , city officials say , zoo station is n't expected to play a major role . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station .

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to . " " we have to work on our strengths and weaknesses , and while we are in a less comfortable situation -lrb- after the argentina loss -rrb- , i still say we can beat the dutch . " dutch winger the man to watch as ivory coast fight to survive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben 's speed and agility undid serbia & montenegro ivory coast striker arouna kone , who has spent three seasons in the dutch league - the last with psv eindhoven , has earmarked left winger arjen robben as the dangerman . robben turned in a scintillating , goal-scoring , man-of-the-match performance against serbia and montenegro , and kone said : " robben is probably the most important player in their team .
in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win . " dutch coach marco van basten added : " they have a lot of good players , experienced players who play in big competitions in england and spain so they are very strong . " " we saw their games in the african nations cup -lrb- where they lost in the final -rrb- , and we know a lot about that .
it will be a tough and very important game for us . " as for the specific threat posed by captain and chelsea striker drogba , van basten was resolute .
" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .
and technically he can make goals .
but we do n't change everything for one player . " concerns over the calf problem suffered by dutch captain edwin van der sar during the serbia-montenegro match have been allayed , and the manchester united goalkeeper will start against ivory coast . and van basten also hinted that influential hamburg midfielder rafael van der vaart might be in line for a call-up , possibly at the expense of wesley sneijder , largely ineffective against the serbs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de netherlands start world cup campaign with win confirming their palace as world cup title contenders , the netherlands opened with a dominating 1-0 win against serbia and montenegro sunday .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 16.06.2006 dutch to counter ivory coast threat with rampaging robben großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will again spearhead the dutch attack as they aim to make the second round the netherlands go into friday 's group c match against ivory coast seeking a win that would almost certainly book their passage into the second round of the world cup . after recording a vital 1-0 win over serbia and montenegro on sunday , the dutch will be hoping for a repeat of the inexperience the young west africans showed in their 2-1 loss to argentina in their opener . " in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to . " " we have to work on our strengths and weaknesses , and while we are in a less comfortable situation -lrb- after the argentina loss -rrb- , i still say we can beat the dutch . " dutch winger the man to watch as ivory coast fight to survive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben 's speed and agility undid serbia & montenegro ivory coast striker arouna kone , who has spent three seasons in the dutch league - the last with psv eindhoven , has earmarked left winger arjen robben as the dangerman . robben turned in a scintillating , goal-scoring , man-of-the-match performance against serbia and montenegro , and kone said : " robben is probably the most important player in their team .
in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2006 beloved west berlin landmark begins rapid decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station , once a bustling hub , is now a shadow of its former self berlin 's new main rail station opened at the end of may .
since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2006 beloved west berlin landmark begins rapid decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station , once a bustling hub , is now a shadow of its former self berlin 's new main rail station opened at the end of may .
since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .
" it is about keeping a part of our city vibrant and convenient . " on with the new across the city , in the once-barren area , a shiny , gigantic station - and the largest in europe - is bustling with travelers and shoppers .
berlin hauptbahnhof is the last of the big construction projects of the city 's post-unification phase - and , many hope , the start of a new chapter for a city which has seen lower population growth than once expected and thus far failed to emerge from its financial doldrums . " we had big dreams after the berlin wall fell , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" and with this station , we are hoping to make them more of a reality . " and in that reality , city officials say , zoo station is n't expected to play a major role . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "

as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .

some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .
the eu package is worth an estimated 100 million euros -lrb- $ 126 million -rrb- . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes stock of cloudy future the eu admitted thursday there would be no " miracles " as it battles to revive its fortunes at a morose summit clouded by institutional limbo and growing doubts over enlargement plans .

-lrb- june 12 , 2006 -rrb- eu says it will help palestinians the eu is trying to create a special aid fund for palestinians that would bypass the hamas-led palestinian government .

the youngster latched on to the swiftly taken free kick to feed crespo with an inch-perfect cross to crespo for argentina 's fifth carlos tevez , who replaced saviola midway through the second half , dribbled past two defenders and curled his shot past jevric , while messi , hailed as maradona 's heir , marked his return from injury with his first world cup goal in only 15 minutes on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de weakened serbia & montenegro ripe for argentinean plucking two-time world cup winners argentina , buoyed by three points from their first game against ivory coast , on friday take on a serbia-montenegro side severely weakened by the loss of defensive pillar nemanja vidic .

with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march .

" klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .

van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .

in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .

since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .
" it is about keeping a part of our city vibrant and convenient . " on with the new across the city , in the once-barren area , a shiny , gigantic station - and the largest in europe - is bustling with travelers and shoppers .
berlin hauptbahnhof is the last of the big construction projects of the city 's post-unification phase - and , many hope , the start of a new chapter for a city which has seen lower population growth than once expected and thus far failed to emerge from its financial doldrums . " we had big dreams after the berlin wall fell , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" and with this station , we are hoping to make them more of a reality . " and in that reality , city officials say , zoo station is n't expected to play a major role . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .
they meet argentina on june 21st to determine the winner of group c. ivory coast , on the other hand , will head home after their last match against serbia-montenegro . dw staff -lrb- cha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch to counter ivory coast threat with rampaging robben the netherlands go into friday 's group c match against ivory coast seeking a win that would almost certainly book their passage into the second round of the world cup .

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .

leaders merely agreed to continue debate on the constitution - something they have done for the past year with no evident success .
they vowed a final decision on the treaty 's fate by the end of 2008 . " we need more time to reflect , " said french president jacques chirac whose country , along with the netherlands , rejected the constitution in a referendum last year , putting the document effectively on ice . all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force .
some countries , such as germany , want to ram through as much of the text as possible , despite the french and dutch " no " votes . but the dutch government insists the constitution be cut back , reduced in scope and renamed as a mere treaty so it can be put up for a vote in their parliament rather than face another referendum .
in any case , no progress is expected on the constitution until after french and dutch elections in mid-2007 .
new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to slovenia , but not lithuania they also confirmed the rejection of lithuania 's bid to join the euro zone next year due to its overshooting inflation targets .
several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .

new enlargement criteria turning to enlargement , eu leaders raised hurdles for future applicants by setting new criteria for enlargement : the ability of present member states to absorb any new members which are mainly poorer nations from the western balkans . bildunterschrift : eu leaders feel it 's already gotten hard enough to get everyone on the same page in the past , admission terms were more straightforward and mainly based on applicants conforming to eu laws , rights and norms .
this led to the 2004 " big bang " expansion of the bloc to include 10 new states , mainly from former communist eastern europe .
but reacting to a public backlash against fast-track expansion , governments have been losing enthusiasm for taking in further members .
" it is two sides of the same coin .
the candidate must be ready to take all obligations but the union must be ready to integrate new member states , " said austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schüssel in brussels on thursday while saying small balkans states like croatia had good prospects for joining the eu , schüssel and german chancellor angela merkel said entry for a country as big as turkey would be more problematic .
" turkish membership is a huge challenge .
this is obvious , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
swedish prime minister goran persson , while signing up for the still-to-be-defined principle of " absorption capacity , " insisted it must not be used as an excuse to keep out new members .
euro comes to slovenia in other business , eu leaders approved slovenia joining the euro single currency zone on jan.1 , 2007 .
the move was hailed by leaders as a " significant and extremely positive step forward " in europe 's monetary integration .

several eastern european states , including the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia , expressed their anger over the rejection .
together with lithuania , they called for a " discussion on the interpretation of the price stability criterion in order to better reflect the economic dynamics of the enlarged european union . "
palestinian aid package approved leaders also endorsed a substantial aid package for the cash-strapped palestinians , to be paid via a new funding mechanism set to become operational next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians may soon get money from the eu eu officials said they expected the other members of the middle east diplomatic quartet - the united nations , the united states and russia - to also approve the mechanism in coming days . " we are very close to an agreement , " eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters as she arrived at a summit of eu leaders in brussels . the eu commission has been trying to design a mechanism that would funnel much-needed funds to palestinians without the money going to the hamas-led government , which refuses to renounce violence or recognize israel .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .
they meet argentina on june 21st to determine the winner of group c. ivory coast , on the other hand , will head home after their last match against serbia-montenegro . dw staff -lrb- cha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch to counter ivory coast threat with rampaging robben the netherlands go into friday 's group c match against ivory coast seeking a win that would almost certainly book their passage into the second round of the world cup .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before .

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to .

in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win . " dutch coach marco van basten added : " they have a lot of good players , experienced players who play in big competitions in england and spain so they are very strong . " " we saw their games in the african nations cup -lrb- where they lost in the final -rrb- , and we know a lot about that .
it will be a tough and very important game for us . " as for the specific threat posed by captain and chelsea striker drogba , van basten was resolute .
" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .
and technically he can make goals .
but we do n't change everything for one player . " concerns over the calf problem suffered by dutch captain edwin van der sar during the serbia-montenegro match have been allayed , and the manchester united goalkeeper will start against ivory coast . and van basten also hinted that influential hamburg midfielder rafael van der vaart might be in line for a call-up , possibly at the expense of wesley sneijder , largely ineffective against the serbs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de netherlands start world cup campaign with win confirming their palace as world cup title contenders , the netherlands opened with a dominating 1-0 win against serbia and montenegro sunday .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings . " we went over the first game with a fine tooth comb .
we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph . " it was unbelievable to see us score in the final minute , " winger bastian schweinsteiger told reporters .
" i think we can play even better , and we 'll try and prove it in the next game .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .

last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament .

in a letter to the bundesnetzagentur , eu officials said telekom should be made to show exactly how it charges for calls , and if its prices are based on actual costs .
prices for telecommunications services are higher in germany than in most other eu countries .
commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters that , with 94 percent of the fixed-line call market , deutsche telekom had " significant market power that needs to be regulated . "
" there is a problem of competition on the german fixed access market , " he said .
" the german telecoms regulator should use its powers under the eu telecom rules to impose efficient remedies on this market . "
suggested remedies fall short selmayr said that the eu information society and media commissioner viviane reding was not satisfied with the " remedies " put forward by the bundesnetzagentur so far .
last month , the regulator sent a proposal to brussels describing a plan to ask deutsche telekom to inform it of future prices .
" the commission does n't believe the proposal of remedies is sufficient , " he said .
" to achieve cost orientation we believe that … price regulation is necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's planned new high-speed network has also come under fire the commission has also criticized deutsche telekom 's plans for a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- high-speed network , saying a new monopoly must not be created to replace the old and that the company must open up infrastructure to rivals .
as the eu recommendations are only " semi-binding , " germany is not required to fulfil them , but a national regulator must take " utmost account " of a request from brussels .
should the german regulator fail to implement brussels ' recommendations , germany could face breach of contract procedures based on eu telecoms legislation .
the procedure could lead to a lawsuit at the european court of justice .
according to the commission , other eu states including austria , ireland , the netherlands , and spain have already tackled a lack of competition in their retail phone markets . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2006 beloved west berlin landmark begins rapid decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoo station , once a bustling hub , is now a shadow of its former self berlin 's new main rail station opened at the end of may .
since then , millions have boarded its trains and shopped its stores .
but on the other side of town , an institution is dying a slow death because of it . at first glance , it looks like the normal hustle and bustle around berlin 's classic upmarket shopping street , the kurfürstendamm , in the western part of the city .
crowds move among bus stops , shops , a cinema , fast food restaurants across the street from zoo station -lrb- bahnhof zoologischer garten -rrb- or to the erotic museum . but come closer to the station and one can see that the busy street scene has been slightly deceptive .
the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside the station , life goes on as usual the station 's ticket office , once marked by lines and chatter , has become a lonely place .
a few people mill about the main halls , but there is nothing like the teeming crowds that passed through here only a month ago .
the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .
shops and restaurants thrived on the kurfürstendamm shopping street nearby .
that boulevard 's famous kaufhaus des westens , or kdw department store , and the europa center shopping complex became beloved landmarks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station was destroyed at the end of wwii young people used the station as a meeting place ; some came there to deal drugs or engage in prostitution .
it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .
" it feels as if something good has come to an end . " still fighting since germany 's rail system , deutsche bahn , announced plans to end stops of high-speed and international trains at zoo station last year , the community has been up in arms , staging protests , writing letters and pressuring politicians . while zoo station still carries symbolic power and historical weight , nostalgia is not behind the fight to save it , says mayor thiemen .
she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .
" we want deutsche bahn to rethink this but so far they are opposed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new station is a ritzy place compared to drab zoo station " this is not an east-west thing or a west berlin thing or even against the new train station , " she added .
" it is about keeping a part of our city vibrant and convenient . " on with the new across the city , in the once-barren area , a shiny , gigantic station - and the largest in europe - is bustling with travelers and shoppers .
berlin hauptbahnhof is the last of the big construction projects of the city 's post-unification phase - and , many hope , the start of a new chapter for a city which has seen lower population growth than once expected and thus far failed to emerge from its financial doldrums . " we had big dreams after the berlin wall fell , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" and with this station , we are hoping to make them more of a reality . " and in that reality , city officials say , zoo station is n't expected to play a major role . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station .

the vendor who once hawked crepes here is gone .
the sausage stand has pulled up stakes and the baked goods seller has left as well .
only the asian food stand remains . perhaps even more surprising is the absence of the usual array of beggars and drunks that have hung around the station since most people can remember .
even the punks sitting on the ground with their spiky , dyed hair and leather jackets , once a fixture , have moved on . " it is n't that easy to see the difference at first , " said olaf kehrein who commutes into berlin from his home in the surrounding state of brandenburg .
" but it just does n't feel the same . " marginalized as berlin planners envisioned , travelers now catch high-speed trains to germany 's main cities and beyond from the new central station .
so these days , a glance at the zoo station schedule shows trains only to nearby smaller cities such as cottbus , magdeburg or frankfurt an der oder . and it shows .

the coffee stands , the food market , even the chain stores , such as tie rack and the body shop , are empty at rush hour . " we do n't have much to do , " admits one employee at a shop .
" i fear for my job . " while merchants near the station report little drop in business so far , inside , a few stands have closed up shop .
most others are holding on .
but zoo station just does n't have the foot traffic of other regional stations such as the friedrichstrasse station in the central mitte district .
city officials expect more businesses to depart in the future . " we 'll see after the world cup is over , " said monika thiemen , the district 's mayor .
" but it already is n't looking good . " a legend zoo station first opened in 1882 as part of the city 's light-rail system .
soon after , national and international trains began to stop there , and at the turn of the century , berlin 's first subway line , the u2 , started rumbling under the station . during world war ii , the station was heavily damaged .
ten years passed before it began handling train and subway traffic again .
after the berlin wall went up in 1961 , dividing the city , the station 's prominence grew - and it became a symbol of sorts , finding a lasting place in the hearts of west berliners and becoming familiar to people around the world . then , it served as the west 's main station and berlin 's link with west germany .
and since the center of pre-war berlin was now behind the wall , the neighborhood around zoo station became the focal point of west berlin .

it was the gateway for western tourists visiting the divided city , and a must-see for those arriving by air .
the station was immortalized many times by musicians , artists and directors as the station served as a backdrop in movies , travelogues and in songs by the rock band u2 and singer nina hagen . " it is just eerie now , " said longtime berlin resident david ronhoff of the near-empty station , as he picked up a coffee .

she and other local groups say the fact that trains from the new central station still run through the station but do n't stop deprives people who live in the area of a convenient travel hub .
she and her allies are planning more demonstrations , lobbying and other attempts to save the station after the world cup is over in july . " it makes no sense that they ca n't stop for a few minutes , and in doing so , give this part of the city access and keep businesses alive , " she said .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .
a year ago the eu was completely divided .
now things are better and there is basis for optimism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik but his foreign minister , ursula plassnik , declined to comment on hopes of resolving the constitutional conundrum in the next couple of years , saying only that something must be done by 2009 , when the next eu-wide elections are held . " there will be no miracles , " she said , adding : " 2009 will be a key year for the european union . " the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .
the constitution included a number of key reforms , notably to voting rights but also creating an eu foreign minister and full-time president , seen as crucial to avoid decision-making gridlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : further eu enlargement makes many people nervous " we can not say ' yes ' to enlargement and not to changing the institutions so that we can work in an efficient manner in an enlarged manner in an enlarged europe , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso . british foreign secretary margaret beckett was more downbeat on the constitution , lamenting that there seems to be even less accord now than before .

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to . " " we have to work on our strengths and weaknesses , and while we are in a less comfortable situation -lrb- after the argentina loss -rrb- , i still say we can beat the dutch . " dutch winger the man to watch as ivory coast fight to survive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben 's speed and agility undid serbia & montenegro ivory coast striker arouna kone , who has spent three seasons in the dutch league - the last with psv eindhoven , has earmarked left winger arjen robben as the dangerman . robben turned in a scintillating , goal-scoring , man-of-the-match performance against serbia and montenegro , and kone said : " robben is probably the most important player in their team .
in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win . " dutch coach marco van basten added : " they have a lot of good players , experienced players who play in big competitions in england and spain so they are very strong . " " we saw their games in the african nations cup -lrb- where they lost in the final -rrb- , and we know a lot about that .
it will be a tough and very important game for us . " as for the specific threat posed by captain and chelsea striker drogba , van basten was resolute .
" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .
and technically he can make goals .
but we do n't change everything for one player . " concerns over the calf problem suffered by dutch captain edwin van der sar during the serbia-montenegro match have been allayed , and the manchester united goalkeeper will start against ivory coast . and van basten also hinted that influential hamburg midfielder rafael van der vaart might be in line for a call-up , possibly at the expense of wesley sneijder , largely ineffective against the serbs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de netherlands start world cup campaign with win confirming their palace as world cup title contenders , the netherlands opened with a dominating 1-0 win against serbia and montenegro sunday .

aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune . for the cash-strapped german capital , the soccer world cup is a real boon .
with 500,000 new arrivals in the city every day , berlin boasts more visitors than any other city that 's hosting the soccer matches . of the half a million visitors here per day , no fewer than 200,000 stay in hotels and bed-and-breakfast places .
many shops in downtown berlin are registering record turnovers with soccer-related souvenirs selling like hot cakes . " all the guests from foreign countries visiting germany are coming in this shop , " said one street vendor near the brandenburg gate .
" it 's not the german people , it 's just outside people that come in here and they are especially interested in souvenirs for the world championship . " tricky exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian fans may look funny , but they 're bringing much-needed cash to germany an australian tourist nearby , who had accompanied his team to their first world cup in 32 years , was just about to get a feel of the city and find his way around . " i 'm just going around , seeing the sites and eating the wonderful german food , " he said , adding that he is certain that at the end of his stay in berlin his pockets will be much emptier as he only gets about 50 euro cents -lrb- 60 us cents -rrb- for one australian dollar . " we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .
so even with the exchange rate it 's always on par with what i would spend in australia . " 50 million euros per day according to the latest statistics , the ordinary berlin visitor during the world cup spends about 180 euros on average , hotel costs included .
this means that berlin collects some 50 million euros from tourists every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swedes are roughing it , but they do love german beer the swedish tourists , for example , who were in town for thursday 's match pitting their team against paraguay , were certainly willing to add to the windfall .
but how much money were they willing to spend here ? two hundreds euros , said one man , who was echoed by a female fan . " if we win , we 'll spend more , " said another , adding that he could fork out up to 400 euros .
" and we will win . " lots of beer and sausages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called fan mile in front of the brandenburg gate business has been particularly brisk on berlin 's so-called " fan mile " - a two-kilometer-long -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- stretch for soccer buffs in the city center that starts right behind the brandenburg gate . the mile boasts several public viewing areas , with street vendors flanking the street .
among other things , they 've already sold one and a half million liters of beer and one and half million german sausages . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forget the title - germany wants an economic boom germany 's influential diw economic research institute released a forecast that the world cup would not significantly aid the country 's economy .
yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different .
-lrb- may 21 , 2006 -rrb- germany launches world cup charm offensive germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face .

with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood .

with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march .

aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune . for the cash-strapped german capital , the soccer world cup is a real boon .
with 500,000 new arrivals in the city every day , berlin boasts more visitors than any other city that 's hosting the soccer matches . of the half a million visitors here per day , no fewer than 200,000 stay in hotels and bed-and-breakfast places .
many shops in downtown berlin are registering record turnovers with soccer-related souvenirs selling like hot cakes . " all the guests from foreign countries visiting germany are coming in this shop , " said one street vendor near the brandenburg gate .
" it 's not the german people , it 's just outside people that come in here and they are especially interested in souvenirs for the world championship . " tricky exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian fans may look funny , but they 're bringing much-needed cash to germany an australian tourist nearby , who had accompanied his team to their first world cup in 32 years , was just about to get a feel of the city and find his way around . " i 'm just going around , seeing the sites and eating the wonderful german food , " he said , adding that he is certain that at the end of his stay in berlin his pockets will be much emptier as he only gets about 50 euro cents -lrb- 60 us cents -rrb- for one australian dollar . " we have to be careful with what we spend , " he said .
" but the prices here do seem to be quite reasonable .
so even with the exchange rate it 's always on par with what i would spend in australia . " 50 million euros per day according to the latest statistics , the ordinary berlin visitor during the world cup spends about 180 euros on average , hotel costs included .
this means that berlin collects some 50 million euros from tourists every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swedes are roughing it , but they do love german beer the swedish tourists , for example , who were in town for thursday 's match pitting their team against paraguay , were certainly willing to add to the windfall .
but how much money were they willing to spend here ? two hundreds euros , said one man , who was echoed by a female fan . " if we win , we 'll spend more , " said another , adding that he could fork out up to 400 euros .
" and we will win . " lots of beer and sausages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called fan mile in front of the brandenburg gate business has been particularly brisk on berlin 's so-called " fan mile " - a two-kilometer-long -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- stretch for soccer buffs in the city center that starts right behind the brandenburg gate . the mile boasts several public viewing areas , with street vendors flanking the street .
among other things , they 've already sold one and a half million liters of beer and one and half million german sausages . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de forget the title - germany wants an economic boom germany 's influential diw economic research institute released a forecast that the world cup would not significantly aid the country 's economy .

-lrb- may 21 , 2006 -rrb- germany launches world cup charm offensive germans are not exactly known as a nation of charmers , but the world cup mania may change all that .
a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face .

under the reforming guidance of the former stuttgart , inter milan , tottenham and bayern munich star , there has been a generational shift in the german squad . the going has n't been easy .
teething troubles included a disastrous 4-1 loss earlier this year to italy , which saw abuse heaped on the side amid acrimonious media claims that a california-based klinsmann was possibly not the man to bring the world cup home after a 16-year void . critics silenced by victory but klinsmann 's decision to field youngsters such as per mertesacker , david odonkor and lukas podolski has been vindicated by the team 's two group wins in the world cup so far , which have galvanized an entire nation .
suddenly , the fans believe in the team again and , increasingly , so do the players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been under fire in germany in the past germany 's media - and in particular the mass-selling tabloid bild - which have launched savage attacks on klinsmann and his tactics in the past , suddenly seemed to change their tune after the team 's impressive performance in the tournament . " klinsi 's already jubilating like a world champion again , " bild headlined , while others commented that the win had silenced even the most persistent of critics . " overpowering emotion " odonkor was still taking in his dream of appearing in the world cup on his dortmund home turf as a substitute in the win over poland , which essentially ensured entry into the last 16 .
it was a dipping cross by odonkor that allowed another substitute , striker oliver neuville , to slide in and convert it into a goal in the dying minutes of the game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ecstatic oliver neuville after he scored the goal against poland " when the goal went in i just did n't know where to run - the emotion of the moment was overpowering , " said the 22-year-old whose father is ghanaian and whose mother is german . the attacking midfielder was a surprise call-up into the german squad and saw his development hampered by a serious knee injury after making his bundesliga debut in 2002 . odonkor says the atmosphere at the world cup in the german camp could not be better and the young players are being well looked after . " the whole team have taken me under their wing - it 's really like a family , " odonkor said thursday at the german team 's berlin media headquarters .
" my family came -lrb- to the poland game -rrb- .
it was so important to me they were in the stadium . " germans quietly confident the germans looked rocky at the back in conceding two goals against plucky costa rica , but odonkor and mertesacker insisted the problems had largely been ironed out after the squad sat down and analyzed where they were going wrong in defense . " we showed we are a good team and we can be proud of our performance , " odonkor said , echoing klinsmann 's assessment after the final whistle . mertesacker , of hannover 96 , who already has 25 caps to his name at 21 as a cultured defender , has kept his place since a 2004 debut win over iran , holding off claims to bring back one of the veterans of 1998 , christian worns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker -lrb- r . -rrb- fights for the ball with poland 's ebi smolarek he said thursday that the germans were feeling quietly confident after their winning showings .

we decided what needed fixing and worked to iron out those weak points which had emerged in defense . " with klinsmann having fielded a clutch of other young stars , such as lukas podolski of cologne and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger , the future , at least in the mid-term , is suddenly looking quite bright for the hosts .
but it is asking a lot of them to conquer the world in the next three weeks . " it 's a steep learning curve - many people laughed when i was first called up after just 20 league games .
things are going very quickly , " said mertesacker . klinsmann has said that critics had been too hasty in criticizing the team line-up . " some did n't know how to assess the strengths -lrb- of the team -rrb- , " klinsmann said .
" we did n't have any qualification games and some positive and negative results .
but we knew that the real test would come at the world cup .
we believe in this team . " " we can play even better " separately , england and ecuador too qualified for the knock-out stage on thursday , while sweden boosted their chances of joining them in the last 16 with a late win over paraguay . " we have now seen everyone and we have n't really seen anyone we ca n't deal with , " team assistant and euro-96 champion oliver bierhoff said as he looked forward to a likely second-round meeting with england or sweden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manager bierhoff says germany would rather play sweden than england -lrb- here in top form -rrb- " i think i could live better with the winner of sweden versus paraguay , " conceded the man who helped knock england out in the euro-96 semi-finals . whatever the group situation , there is unlikely to be any let-up in the furious pace the hosts have shown at the start of their bid for a fourth world cup triumph .

the dutch came into the group c match knowing that a win , thanks to argentina 's victory earlier in the day , would clinch a berth in the next round .
meanwhile , a loss for ivory coast would mean they would go home after their third match . with so much at stake , both sides started nervously , and there were no early goal chances .
that all changed in the 23rd minute , when netherlands forward robin van persie decided to take matters into his own hands , slashing laterally and drawing a free-kick just outside the penalty box .
van persie then slammed the ball home past keeper jean-jacques titié to put his side up by one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african " elephants " impressed in both their games but could n't grab any points not to be outdone , arjen robben capped a nice solo run four minutes later by finding ruud van nistelrooy .
van nistelrooy broke a long scoring drought and gave the oranjes a 2-0 lead . the ivory coast fought back and were rewarded in the 38th minute .
bakary kone pushed the ball up the right and slammed a rocket past dutch keeper edwin van der sar .
the score at half-time was 2-1 for the netherlands .
shortly before the whistle , there was bad news for the " elephants , " as their top goal-getter didier drogba picked up a yellow card .
he misses the next match . as to be expected , ivory coast were the more aggressive team in the second half , but they had major difficulties advancing the ball into the dutch penalty area .
the netherlands concentrated their efforts on defense , hoping to catch their opponents napping on a counter-attack . the best scoring chance came with roughly a quarter of hour left in regulation time .
the netherlands failed to deal with a well-struck ivory coast corner-kick , forcing van persie to chest the ball away on the line . but that was the only second-half situation in which the dutch goal was seriously under threat .
the netherlands get a deserved , if workmanlike 2-1 victory against one of africa 's best sides and are assured of progressing into the next round .

franz beckenbauer is germany 's undisputed king of soccer … or is he ?
with germany advancing to the second round of the world cup , national coach jürgen klinsmann is making a run for the kaiser 's crown . beckenbauer has faithfully attended every match so far in the world cup , but for the moment his thunder is being stolen by national coach jurgen klinsmann . while beckenbauer , nicknamed ' the kaiser ' , is every inch a german patriot , he could be forgiven for feeling that his role as head of the world cup organizing committee is being steamrollered by the klinsmann express after the german team reached the second round . the german media is also enthralled with a kind of freedom and freshness in the german side that has n't been there for years - a factor many people are putting down to the free spirit klinsmann has developed since he made the united states his home . california-style coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why is klinsmann suddenly so popular ?
of course , many in german football circles have taken issue with the fact that the 41-year-old is now commuting from california , including beckenbauer himself , who publicly grumbled about klinsmann 's absence at a soccer workshop held in march . " jurgen klinsmann should have been here , " beckenbauer said .
" this is a meeting he had to make and there are not too many of them . " klinsmann , who was also called to account over that by several other notable figures and had to hold emergency talks over the issue of his absences , took note and announced shortly afterwards he would be spending more time in his homeland . it was not the first time that the two had clashed .
ironically , it was when klinsmann was a player for bayern munich , coached by none other than the kaiser , that the two had a difference of opinion . though beckenbauer did not name klinsmann specifically , he cited several players behaving as if they were playing for " fc hollywood . " klinsmann , 108-times capped and scorer of 47 goals for germany , defends his trips home to california on the basis that he is always in touch through e-mail .
but this led to one paper , the berliner zeitung dubbing him " the california internet coach . " confident klinsmann klinsmann knows the best way to answer the critics is by lifting the world cup on july 9 and achieving his goal of emulating beckenbauer by winning the world cup as both a player and manager . proving he 's in tune with the new mood of optimism and patriotism currently sweeping germany , klinsmann even said he 's already booked hotel rooms for the day of the final in berlin on july 9 . beckenbauer , on the other hand , has played a more cautious game saying a quarter-final spot is the very least germany should achieve . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national team coach says he 'll spend more time in germany coach jürgen klinsmann , who has been under fire for spending much of his off-the-field time in california , answered critics by saying on sunday he would spend most of his time in germany until the start of the world cup .
-lrb- march 12 , 2006 -rrb- beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

" in our group , all points are very vital , " admitted dutch defender giovanni van bronckhorst .
" it 's clear that we 've got four very strong teams -lrb- in the group -rrb- .
there 's been a one-goal difference in both games so far , " he said .
" for our next game against ivory coast , if we win that we are almost in the second round .
we want to qualify as soon as possible and do n't want to have to go into the third game having to secure a win . " ivory coast will no doubt be buoyed by the mothers of the 23 players in the squad holding a three-day fast and prayer sessions before friday 's game in stuttgart , but more realistically will be aiming to inject some ruthlessness into their play . coach michel henri , lambasted in the abidjan press after the argentina game , was disappointed after that match but remains confident . " i believe we paid for our inexperience at this level , " said the frenchman who guided france to the 1986 world cup semi-finals and who has also coached morocco and cameroon .
" now we need a big performance against the dutch and a good result .
that is what we are going to address ourselves to .

in their first match , all attacks were led by him . " among the biggest concerns for the netherlands are the ivory coast strike force of didier drogba , kone and bonaventure kalou .
" it 's going to be a hard game trying to contain that trio , " defender john heitinga told reporters .
" it promises to be a really tough game against their strikers , but i think that if we play football we 'll win . " dutch coach marco van basten added : " they have a lot of good players , experienced players who play in big competitions in england and spain so they are very strong . " " we saw their games in the african nations cup -lrb- where they lost in the final -rrb- , and we know a lot about that .
it will be a tough and very important game for us . " as for the specific threat posed by captain and chelsea striker drogba , van basten was resolute .
" we know he 's a very good player , very strong .
and technically he can make goals .
but we do n't change everything for one player . " concerns over the calf problem suffered by dutch captain edwin van der sar during the serbia-montenegro match have been allayed , and the manchester united goalkeeper will start against ivory coast . and van basten also hinted that influential hamburg midfielder rafael van der vaart might be in line for a call-up , possibly at the expense of wesley sneijder , largely ineffective against the serbs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de netherlands start world cup campaign with win confirming their palace as world cup title contenders , the netherlands opened with a dominating 1-0 win against serbia and montenegro sunday .

" we want to move from the period of reflection to the period of results , " he said .
" our watchword should be ' goodbye gloom ' .

" the institutional blueprint was designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in a union which expanded from 15 to 25 members in 2004 , with romania and bulgaria hoping to join next year and a handful of others waiting on the bench . progress ? but few now expect any real progress until after elections next year to choose a successor to french president jacques chirac , once the bloc 's key player but now widely regarded as a lame duck . new german chancellor angela merkel has recently raised hopes that she could end the constitutional impasse .
merkel struck an upbeat note as she arrived in brussels , underlining the need for eu leaders to reconnect with ordinary europeans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no " -lrb- non -rrb- was the resounding word in france when it came to the proposed eu constitution " i believe we should lay the foundations by making clear to people that europe is needed , " she said , adding that the german eu presidency will notably call for red tape to be cut . " then we will tell people again and again , in an open way , that we need this europe and for that we need the constitution , " she added . staging new referendums is considered politically impossible , but danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen nevertheless underlined that it was " up to france and netherlands to make the necessary clarifications . " future expansion the institutional impasse has also fueled questions about the european bloc 's continuing expansion plans .

agreeing to introduce the law on employment discrimination was a condition for latvia 's accession to the european union in 2004 .
but mps refused to implement it in full after a parliamentary debate where homosexuality was described as a sin .
latvia recently made constitutional changes to prevent same-sex marriages .
' degenerate ' slur latvian politicians voted not to include specific reference to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation after a long and heated debate , which included some stridently anti-homosexual language .
representatives of latvia 's first party , the christian democratic party , which had proposed sexual orientation be dropped from the anti-discrimination bill , described homosexuality as a sin and homosexual people as " degenerate " .
latvia is now the only eu member state without legislation specifically outlawing discrimination at work on the grounds of sexual orientation .
the international lesbian and gay association said that the mps ' actions showed a fundamental disrespect for the values and principles of the european union .
it said it hoped the european commission would take the legal action it was entitled to take to ensure the law was implemented in full .
homosexuality is a controversial political issue in latvia .
earlier this year , parliament changed the country 's constitution to ensure that same-sex marriage could not be made legal , and the first gay pride march in latvia , which took place last summer , was marred by angry protests .

but lurking underneath locoroco 's pretty façade is a cocktail of yoshi , katamari , vib ribbon , kirby and marble madness .
it is also the best playstation portable -lrb- psp -rrb- game to date .
globally , it is no secret that ds sales have been edging out the psp .
nintendo 's sublime understanding of what makes a good portable game has trumped sony so far in the software stakes .
in a market where most decent psp titles are scaled-down versions of console franchises , locoroco is that rare beast .
it is a game designed completely from the ground up for the machine ; a proper handheld experience that is perfect for short joyous blasts .
blobbing around gameplay is simple .
guide your fat gelatinous blob to the end of each meandering level , finding secrets , battling the odd enemy and picking up compadres en route .
locoroco format : psp graphics : 8 sound : 9 gameplay : 9 enduring appeal : 8 overall : 8.5 rather than controlling your locoroco , players press a button to tilt the screen and coax the blob to the goal .
it can also split into a gaggle of tiny blobs to traverse tight spots .
the game offers a rich , multilayered trifle of platforming and puzzles .
each cheery screen is a work of design genius that would not look out of place in a lemon jelly video .
it populated by such bizarre characterisations and pitch-perfect obstacles that you half suspect that nintendo 's miyamoto has been moonlighting at sony towers .
music also plays a huge part in the game 's success .
each level rings out to a rich score peppered with your blob 's babblings .
pick up enough of the musical oddities and they will play choir to the music , building in harmony as their numbers swell and changing in tone depending on the type of locoroco you are using .
travelling companion a work of undiluted japanese whimsy , this deserves to be a massive success .
locoroco is a platform game with a twist of cuteness but it will no doubt join the cultish ranks of vib ribbon , katamari and ico .
everything gels perfectly and , due to its simplicity , that psp bugbear of heavy loading times is not even an issue , making this the ideal travelling companion .
it is not all perfect .
the controls can feel sluggish at times , while the overall pace is just a little too sedate for its own good .
minor quibbles aside , locoroco is a psp essential and the perfect antidote to the current overkill of driving and shooting fests .
this is the best game nintendo never made .

it is a game designed completely from the ground up for the machine ; a proper handheld experience that is perfect for short joyous blasts .
blobbing around gameplay is simple .
guide your fat gelatinous blob to the end of each meandering level , finding secrets , battling the odd enemy and picking up compadres en route .
locoroco format : psp graphics : 8 sound : 9 gameplay : 9 enduring appeal : 8 overall : 8.5 rather than controlling your locoroco , players press a button to tilt the screen and coax the blob to the goal .
it can also split into a gaggle of tiny blobs to traverse tight spots .
the game offers a rich , multilayered trifle of platforming and puzzles .
each cheery screen is a work of design genius that would not look out of place in a lemon jelly video .
it populated by such bizarre characterisations and pitch-perfect obstacles that you half suspect that nintendo 's miyamoto has been moonlighting at sony towers .
music also plays a huge part in the game 's success .
each level rings out to a rich score peppered with your blob 's babblings .
pick up enough of the musical oddities and they will play choir to the music , building in harmony as their numbers swell and changing in tone depending on the type of locoroco you are using .
travelling companion a work of undiluted japanese whimsy , this deserves to be a massive success .
locoroco is a platform game with a twist of cuteness but it will no doubt join the cultish ranks of vib ribbon , katamari and ico .
everything gels perfectly and , due to its simplicity , that psp bugbear of heavy loading times is not even an issue , making this the ideal travelling companion .
it is not all perfect .
the controls can feel sluggish at times , while the overall pace is just a little too sedate for its own good .
minor quibbles aside , locoroco is a psp essential and the perfect antidote to the current overkill of driving and shooting fests .
this is the best game nintendo never made .

but over the course of the world cup finals , the fan camp in dortmund is offering budget travellers a handy and relatively cheap place to lay their heads .
the westfalenhallen complex - more usually known as a trade fair centre - has been transformed with the addition of bunk beds to sleep 3,952 people .
builders and plumbers moved in two weeks before the tournament kicked off to install temporary partition walls , 2,500 lockers , an internet cafe and 120 showers .
big screens have been put up in two halls so fans can watch the games - including those played just 300m away in dortmund 's westfalenstadion - before whiling the night away at the on-site disco .
the camp even has its own " beach bar " outside - complete with sand and potted palms - and the 30 euro-a-night -lrb- £ 20 , $ 38 -rrb- charge for short stays includes free public transport within the region .
clean toilets for ewitts rollocks , a 55-year-old from trinidad and tobago now running a business in new york , the fan camp offered a haven when his hotel booking fell through .
i find it very pleasant .
everything works - and there are always paper towels in the washrooms ewitts rollocks trinidad and tobago fan he has already been at the camp for a week - and may return for a few more days after a trip to rome .
" i find it very pleasant , " he said .
" the staff are very good , the toilets are clean and everything works .
and there are always paper towels in the washrooms . "
as for trinidad and tobago 's chances in the world cup , mr rollocks adds : " we are just happy to be here .
" we did not expect to do well , so it was a nice surprise to draw against sweden . "
no friction daniel dreier , a public relations officer for westfalenhallen , said people from more than 40 nations were expected to stay during the month-long tournament .
alcohol is served on site but there is no friction between rival fans " last weekend we had 2,500 people - most from sweden and a lot from england , " he said .
" the swedish fans loved the beach bar .
" we 've also had people from switzerland , ireland , scotland , panama , mexico and the us .
this weekend we 're hoping for another 2,000 for the switzerland-togo game . "
although alcohol is served on site there has been no friction between rival fans , mr dreier said , with everyone apparently enjoying the chance to meet people from all over the world .
the youngest guest so far has been three years old , and the oldest 66 .
many people are staying for up to two weeks and five visitors are booked in for the entire tournament .
mixed review however , not everyone has found the fan camp experience everything they hoped .
the atmosphere is very good - but you could n't say it is comfortable mariusz spalek polish fan polish football fan peter zickinski - mulling over poland 's 1-0 defeat by germany - said : " we did n't know what to expect .
we were a little bit surprised by the beds .
" but it 's all right - it 's another experience .
the good thing is it 's close to the stadium and the people are friendly . "
fellow pole mariusz spalek , 23 , visiting from katowice with his father henryk , also gave the camp a mixed review .
" it 's nice , you can watch the game , there 's beer and the people are fun , " he said .
" there are people from lots of countries - lots of germans and mexicans , brazilians .
" the atmosphere is very good - but you could n't say it is comfortable . "
but for anyone not tempted by the bunk beds , the venue has one more draw : it is hosting the 2006 roboworld cup from 29 june to 3 july .
with an international cast of footballing robots battling it out on the pitch , who needs the world 's human soccer stars ?

they are heading for the south of england looking for work .
no-one is exactly sure how many poles are here , but the city council estimate it could be as high as 20,000 .
in a city of 200,000 people that is one in 10 .
the southampton labour mp john denham is concerned that the sheer numbers of people is causing problems .
an example he gives is southampton city college , where this term 1000 people registered to study english .
perhaps , he says , the employers that are profiting from cheap labour could help fund the cost of their studies .
he is also worried that workers unintentionally undermine british employees by working for less money .
he said : " you can not stop competition but you can ensure that they pay their tax and national insurance .
" government agencies need to rigorously enforce this and target these dubious agencies that are dodging tax and also may be involved in other dubious dealings . "
right to work poland became a member of the european union in 2004 , and its citizens won the freedom to work in britain .
two facts explain why so many are choosing to exercise that freedom .
first the average annual income in poland is £ 4,000 a year .
second poland has the highest unemployment rate in europe .
but why come to southampton ?
multiple jobs sixty-two-year-old jan kosniowski came to southampton after the war and now runs an employment agency in the city .
" the older community 's attitude to the new ones is very mixed , " said mr kosiowski .
" for example , we arranged a polish dance but very of the new young people turned up .
perhaps , if it had been a disco the attendance would have been different . "
" many of the new ones come here and concentrate on earning money - working seven days a week .
" some have two jobs and are sending money back to their families in poland .
" some work here for three or four months and then take time off over the summer or christmas and go back to poland for a few weeks and then return on the coaches . "
rafal kopala first arrived eight years ago - illegally .
he left after a few months and came back with a business visa .
rafal kopal now works as a delivery driver for michelin tyres .
" the reason why ?
i am sure why all polish people come to england .
" they are looking for a better life , for work ... and money .
first thing , i think , is the money . "
medical facilities stretched shirley is the heart of southampton 's polish community .
the polish deli stocks a taste of home for 100s of people .
but so many new people are putting a strain on health facilities .
some gps report a huge increase in their workload .
and schools say there is a shortage of polish speakers to help youngsters whose first language is not english .
church role the polish church committee is now trying to improve relations with the new settlers .
" we are now trying to organise english lessons for adults at the polish community centre in the hope the newcomers will attend regularly . "
