" in a statement , released by the information department of the german government , released early on monday , merkel said saddam should " fully bear consequences of his acts like any other iraqi citizen . " great britain , one of the main powers behind the invasion of iraq , was among the few western countries to give an openly positive reception to sunday 's verdict . " i welcome that saddam hussein and the other defendants have faced justice and have been held to account for their crimes , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said in a statement after the baghdad court 's decision . " appalling crimes were committed by saddam hussein 's regime .
it is right that those accused of such crimes against the iraqi people should face iraqi justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi judge needed to shout to be heard in the noisy courtroom " today 's verdict and sentences by the iraqi higher tribunal come at the end of a trial during which evidence has been offered and challenged in the full glare of media scrutiny , " she said . a visibly shaken hussein was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity for his role in ordering the deaths of 148 shiite villagers in the town of dujail in 1982 , the verdict does not address alleged crimes committed by the former leader during campaigns against iran , the kurds or kuwait . hussein 's half-brother barzan al-tikriti and another aide will also hang if automatic appeals fail in the coming months . general european opposition to death sentence spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said the former iraqi dictator should be held accountable for his actions , but added that spain remains firmly opposed the death penalty .
the death penalty is illegal across the entire 25-member european union . swedish foreign minister bildt called saddam verdict " deeply satisfying , " while dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said he was pleased hussein 's " reign of terror " was brought to an end . " justice has been served for what he did , " balkenende told national public television , adding that the netherlands also is opposed to the death penalty . questions remain on future of iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions in iraq were divided along religious lines france 's foreign minister philippe douste-blazy focused his remarks on iraq 's future , saying he hoped the already bloody sectarian strife in the country would not worsen as a result of the death sentence . " i hope this decision will not lead to new tensions and that the iraqis will show restraint , whatever community they belong to , " he said . initial reactions in iraq were split along religious lines with shiites , the majority group now in power but oppressed under hussein , celebrating the verdict while sunnis , the group that held power under hussein , condemned it as propaganda designed to serve us president george w. bush before elections tuesday in the united states . human rights organizations denounce verdict human rights groups slammed the trial for not providing victims with a clear record of facts of what occurred under hussein 's dictatorship and emphasized their rejection of the death penalty under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups said the trial was flawed " it was a lost opportunity to give a sense of the rule of law and a loss for the victims in that the trial and verdict are unlikely to stand the test of time , " human rights watch director for international justice richard dicker told the afp news agency . amnesty international condemned the sentence , describing the trial as a " shabby affair , marred by serious flaws . " the london-based human rights group said the trial should have helped the process of establishing justice and the rule of law in iraq but was in fact " deeply flawed and unfair . " three defense lawyers were killed in the course of the trial , and a previous chief judge resigned over government interference . un human rights chief louise arbour called for a moratorium on executions after former iraqi president saddam hussein was sentenced to death by an iraqi court and expressed her wish that the rights of the defendants to a fair appeal to be " fully respected .

" the boy was incredibly scared until he realized that he was not really going to be shot , " the paper quoted the solider as saying .
the boy was then given a dollar as " a reward . " the witness was quoted as saying he did not come forward earlier to avoid having to " run the gauntlet . " without providing further details , the paper alleged the episode , which it said occurred in kabul , was not an isolated incident and did not publish any photographs associated with the non-commissioned officer 's allegations . ministry promises to investigate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants any soldiers involved to come forward immediately a spokesperson for the defense ministry called on anyone with knowledge of the incident or others like it to come forward immediately in order to " quickly investigate the allegations . " " we call on whoever is claiming this to provide us with the necessary proof without delay so that we can investigate the allegation thoroughly and quickly , " a ministry spokesman said . winfried nachtwei , the opposition green party 's spokesman on security affairs , said the charges needed to be cleared up as soon as possible .
nachtwei told rbb radio these allegations of abuse , if proved true , would be much more serious than other scandals that have recently troubled the bundeswehr . " this would have a different quality than the macabre , obscene games with skeletons , " he said .
" because here a child could have been tormented , and this goes diametrically against the bundeswehr 's orders . " parliament wants more information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties what to know exactly what training german troops get the issue needs to be addressed in wednesday 's meeting of the parliament 's defense committee , according to birgit homburger , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " the fdp is calling for an inspection with the goal of determining what types of training and preparation soldiers receive when they are deployed , " she said . sunday 's allegations come on the heels of photographs published at the end of october showing german troops desecrating skulls and bones in afghanistan , and a separate set of photos showing soldiers driving a jeep painted with a slightly altered version of the insignia used by nazi soldiers . military officials last week said they had suspended a total of six soldiers about their roles in the skull desecration while questioning over 20 others for additional information . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new photos link elite german soldiers to nazi emblem the german defense ministry said six soldiers were suspended in connection with a scandal involving troops desecrating skulls found in afghanistan , while new photos of soldiers using a nazi-era emblem have also surfaced .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .

the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .

the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .

most commentators worried the death penalty sent the wrong signals .
some felt justice had been served . iraq should have done away with the death penalty to signal a fresh start in the post-saddam era , according to the berliner zeitung .

" the islamist world will view -lrb- the verdict -rrb- as victor 's justice . " " for president george w. bush , the sentence for saddam is without a doubt a political success that he very much needs ... but he should n't forget that the iraq liberated from its dictator remains ungovernable , " the leipziger volkszeitung commented . spain 's el pais condemned the use of the death penalty .
saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .
and it is british troops who will be in the firing line if there is any backlash , " uk 's the mirror wrote . the guardian said that if " a new iraq is to ever ... emerge from the ruins of the old , eschewing judicial murder would be a good start .

all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .

only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .

" the boy was incredibly scared until he realized that he was not really going to be shot , " the paper quoted the solider as saying .
the boy was then given a dollar as " a reward . " the witness was quoted as saying he did not come forward earlier to avoid having to " run the gauntlet . " without providing further details , the paper alleged the episode , which it said occurred in kabul , was not an isolated incident and did not publish any photographs associated with the non-commissioned officer 's allegations . ministry promises to investigate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants any soldiers involved to come forward immediately a spokesperson for the defense ministry called on anyone with knowledge of the incident or others like it to come forward immediately in order to " quickly investigate the allegations . " " we call on whoever is claiming this to provide us with the necessary proof without delay so that we can investigate the allegation thoroughly and quickly , " a ministry spokesman said . winfried nachtwei , the opposition green party 's spokesman on security affairs , said the charges needed to be cleared up as soon as possible .
nachtwei told rbb radio these allegations of abuse , if proved true , would be much more serious than other scandals that have recently troubled the bundeswehr . " this would have a different quality than the macabre , obscene games with skeletons , " he said .
" because here a child could have been tormented , and this goes diametrically against the bundeswehr 's orders . " parliament wants more information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties what to know exactly what training german troops get the issue needs to be addressed in wednesday 's meeting of the parliament 's defense committee , according to birgit homburger , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " the fdp is calling for an inspection with the goal of determining what types of training and preparation soldiers receive when they are deployed , " she said . sunday 's allegations come on the heels of photographs published at the end of october showing german troops desecrating skulls and bones in afghanistan , and a separate set of photos showing soldiers driving a jeep painted with a slightly altered version of the insignia used by nazi soldiers . military officials last week said they had suspended a total of six soldiers about their roles in the skull desecration while questioning over 20 others for additional information . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new photos link elite german soldiers to nazi emblem the german defense ministry said six soldiers were suspended in connection with a scandal involving troops desecrating skulls found in afghanistan , while new photos of soldiers using a nazi-era emblem have also surfaced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 06.11.2006 making sense of new eu airport security regulations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bag it or lose it : new eu regulations are very clear on what you can and ca n't carry on board the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .
dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 06.11.2006 corruption a cause of poverty in the developing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's sometimes impossible to get ahead without waving money in front of the right eyes berlin-based transparency international released its annual corruption report monday .
the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake .
-lrb- 29.03.2006 -rrb- corruption catches up with germany a report published by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb .

saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 06.11.2006 " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans vote for the house of representatives and one-third of the senate will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?
americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
the quickest end possible to the bush administration to stop him from implementing any more ridiculous policies . interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hits out at us sanctioning of secret prisons german chancellor merkel , who has worked to boost ties with the us since taking office , rebuked washington on the use of secret prisons by the cia - admitted for the first time by us president bush .
-lrb- 09.09.2006 -rrb- bush visit : bonding over barbecue on the baltic sea us president george w. bush has arrived for his two-day visit with chancellor merkel in her parliamentary district .
his aim ?
to get to know merkel and other " real germans " better - if only security staff will let him .
-lrb- 13.07.2006 -rrb- america 's new bastion in berlin us diplomats tuesday will host a topping-off ceremony for their new embassy in central berlin .
a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship .

11 shook americans inside and outside the us .
for those abroad , " home " had suddenly become unsafe .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .

that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 06.11.2006 corruption a cause of poverty in the developing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's sometimes impossible to get ahead without waving money in front of the right eyes berlin-based transparency international released its annual corruption report monday .
the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake .
-lrb- 29.03.2006 -rrb- corruption catches up with germany a report published by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb .
-lrb- 19.12.2005 -rrb- fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen stepped down as chief of transparency international .
the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself .

" in a statement , released by the information department of the german government , released early on monday , merkel said saddam should " fully bear consequences of his acts like any other iraqi citizen . " great britain , one of the main powers behind the invasion of iraq , was among the few western countries to give an openly positive reception to sunday 's verdict . " i welcome that saddam hussein and the other defendants have faced justice and have been held to account for their crimes , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said in a statement after the baghdad court 's decision . " appalling crimes were committed by saddam hussein 's regime .
it is right that those accused of such crimes against the iraqi people should face iraqi justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi judge needed to shout to be heard in the noisy courtroom " today 's verdict and sentences by the iraqi higher tribunal come at the end of a trial during which evidence has been offered and challenged in the full glare of media scrutiny , " she said . a visibly shaken hussein was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity for his role in ordering the deaths of 148 shiite villagers in the town of dujail in 1982 , the verdict does not address alleged crimes committed by the former leader during campaigns against iran , the kurds or kuwait . hussein 's half-brother barzan al-tikriti and another aide will also hang if automatic appeals fail in the coming months . general european opposition to death sentence spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said the former iraqi dictator should be held accountable for his actions , but added that spain remains firmly opposed the death penalty .
the death penalty is illegal across the entire 25-member european union . swedish foreign minister bildt called saddam verdict " deeply satisfying , " while dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said he was pleased hussein 's " reign of terror " was brought to an end . " justice has been served for what he did , " balkenende told national public television , adding that the netherlands also is opposed to the death penalty . questions remain on future of iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions in iraq were divided along religious lines france 's foreign minister philippe douste-blazy focused his remarks on iraq 's future , saying he hoped the already bloody sectarian strife in the country would not worsen as a result of the death sentence . " i hope this decision will not lead to new tensions and that the iraqis will show restraint , whatever community they belong to , " he said . initial reactions in iraq were split along religious lines with shiites , the majority group now in power but oppressed under hussein , celebrating the verdict while sunnis , the group that held power under hussein , condemned it as propaganda designed to serve us president george w. bush before elections tuesday in the united states . human rights organizations denounce verdict human rights groups slammed the trial for not providing victims with a clear record of facts of what occurred under hussein 's dictatorship and emphasized their rejection of the death penalty under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups said the trial was flawed " it was a lost opportunity to give a sense of the rule of law and a loss for the victims in that the trial and verdict are unlikely to stand the test of time , " human rights watch director for international justice richard dicker told the afp news agency . amnesty international condemned the sentence , describing the trial as a " shabby affair , marred by serious flaws . " the london-based human rights group said the trial should have helped the process of establishing justice and the rule of law in iraq but was in fact " deeply flawed and unfair . " three defense lawyers were killed in the course of the trial , and a previous chief judge resigned over government interference . un human rights chief louise arbour called for a moratorium on executions after former iraqi president saddam hussein was sentenced to death by an iraqi court and expressed her wish that the rights of the defendants to a fair appeal to be " fully respected .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 06.11.2006 " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans vote for the house of representatives and one-third of the senate will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?
americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
the quickest end possible to the bush administration to stop him from implementing any more ridiculous policies . interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hits out at us sanctioning of secret prisons german chancellor merkel , who has worked to boost ties with the us since taking office , rebuked washington on the use of secret prisons by the cia - admitted for the first time by us president bush .
-lrb- 09.09.2006 -rrb- bush visit : bonding over barbecue on the baltic sea us president george w. bush has arrived for his two-day visit with chancellor merkel in her parliamentary district .
his aim ?

from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.11.2006 germany 's eu presidency plans marred by turkey dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkey issue is likely to hang over merkel and germany 's eu presidency in 2007 reviving the constitution , solving energy problems , tackling global warming and improving african relations : germany has big plans for its eu presidency in 2007 .
in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .
otherwise we will have a very , very serious situation in terms of the continuation of accession talks , " merkel said .
" i call on turkey to do everything not to get into this situation and not to lead the european union into this situation . " we do n't want a political confrontation .
but the requirement is that turkey in particular budges , " merkel added .
" the eu can not simply go on as it has done .
turkey must understand that there will be no simple ' carry on ' if there is no movement on cyprus . " however , government sources told german press agency dpa that the current frosty state of relations over cyprus did not mean berlin would seek a break-off of the accession talks , but rather a suspension of sub-sections of those talks . turkey-cyprus dispute threatening accession hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops patrol the border crossing in cyprus cyprus , divided since 1974 when turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece , has become one of the biggest obstacles to turkey 's membership talks with the eu , which began last year . under a customs union agreement with the bloc , ankara must open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , an eu member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize . but turkey refuses to do so until the eu eases the international isolation of the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , as it promised to do after turkish cypriots voted in favor of a un settlement plan to reunify the island in april 2004 . ankara says greek cypriots , who voted down the peace plan , are using their eu membership as leverage to hamper turkey 's bid and extract concessions in the cyprus conflict . relations less cordial under merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship relations between merkel 's government and the turkish administration have continued to become more strained over eu accession than was the case with the previous german red-green coalition under gerhard schröder . under schröder , germany was a key backer of turkey 's bid to become the eu 's first mainly muslim member .
however , merkel 's conservatives prefer offering turkey only a " privileged partnership . " apart from turkey 's accession and the cyprus dispute , the german cabinet on sunday set out germany 's objectives as president of the 25-nation bloc , confirming that it would revive efforts to pass an eu constitutional treaty . merkel told reporters after sunday 's specially convened cabinet meeting that she would try to use germany 's six-month presidency to press eu members to salvage the constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums last year , partly because of concerns about expansion . germany targets eu constitution resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to revive the constitution in 2007 however , she admitted that any result would probably come late in germany 's january-to-june presidency ; given that little could be agreed before the french presidential elections due to conclude in may . " substantial questions such as the constitution will probably have to be decided after the elections in france , " she said . germany is against plans for the stripping down of the constitution , which is supposed to streamline decision-making and create the post of eu foreign minister and to make it more acceptable to voters . merkel said officials must demonstrate to citizens that the union is " pragmatic and manageable . "
she also said the union would have to " live and mature " before it can embark on any further wave of expansion . germany would propose a " berlin declaration " on eu values when eu leaders meet at a summit in the city next march , merkel added . during its coming eu presidency , the cabinet stated that germany would also stress energy policy , the fight to stem climate change and establishing a better partnership with africa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu climate change strategy europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the kyoto protocol expires , german chancellor merkel after a meeting with british prime minister blair .

most commentators worried the death penalty sent the wrong signals .
some felt justice had been served . iraq should have done away with the death penalty to signal a fresh start in the post-saddam era , according to the berliner zeitung .
" the abolishment of the death penalty belongs to the most important achievements of democracy , " the paper wrote .
" when western european politicians welcome the death sentence , it shows their moral and political bankruptcy . " " not many humans will find genuine satisfaction in the judgement against saddam hussein , " the stuttgarter zeitung wrote .
" the islamist world will view -lrb- the verdict -rrb- as victor 's justice . " " for president george w. bush , the sentence for saddam is without a doubt a political success that he very much needs ... but he should n't forget that the iraq liberated from its dictator remains ungovernable , " the leipziger volkszeitung commented . spain 's el pais condemned the use of the death penalty .
saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .
and it is british troops who will be in the firing line if there is any backlash , " uk 's the mirror wrote . the guardian said that if " a new iraq is to ever ... emerge from the ruins of the old , eschewing judicial murder would be a good start . " the sun rejected such arguments as liberal hand-wringing .
" there can be no more fitting end than a hangman 's noose for this gangster-turned-president , " the paper 's editorial declared . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans aim for better ties with middle east world bank president paul wolfowitz , german and arab officials and business leaders are meeting this week to help refocus attention on improving germany 's ties with the middle east .
europeans divided on saddam death sentence while political leaders across europe said saddam hussein should be held accountable for his actions , they also expressed their opposition to the death penalty the former iraqi dictator received on sunday .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- report : germans allegedly gave iraq 's defense plan to us germany passed intelligence on saddam hussein 's plan to defend baghdad to us commanders a month before the united states invaded , according to a news report .

" justice has been served for what he did , " balkenende told national public television , adding that the netherlands also is opposed to the death penalty . questions remain on future of iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions in iraq were divided along religious lines france 's foreign minister philippe douste-blazy focused his remarks on iraq 's future , saying he hoped the already bloody sectarian strife in the country would not worsen as a result of the death sentence . " i hope this decision will not lead to new tensions and that the iraqis will show restraint , whatever community they belong to , " he said . initial reactions in iraq were split along religious lines with shiites , the majority group now in power but oppressed under hussein , celebrating the verdict while sunnis , the group that held power under hussein , condemned it as propaganda designed to serve us president george w. bush before elections tuesday in the united states . human rights organizations denounce verdict human rights groups slammed the trial for not providing victims with a clear record of facts of what occurred under hussein 's dictatorship and emphasized their rejection of the death penalty under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups said the trial was flawed " it was a lost opportunity to give a sense of the rule of law and a loss for the victims in that the trial and verdict are unlikely to stand the test of time , " human rights watch director for international justice richard dicker told the afp news agency . amnesty international condemned the sentence , describing the trial as a " shabby affair , marred by serious flaws . " the london-based human rights group said the trial should have helped the process of establishing justice and the rule of law in iraq but was in fact " deeply flawed and unfair . " three defense lawyers were killed in the course of the trial , and a previous chief judge resigned over government interference . un human rights chief louise arbour called for a moratorium on executions after former iraqi president saddam hussein was sentenced to death by an iraqi court and expressed her wish that the rights of the defendants to a fair appeal to be " fully respected .

" the boy was incredibly scared until he realized that he was not really going to be shot , " the paper quoted the solider as saying .
the boy was then given a dollar as " a reward . " the witness was quoted as saying he did not come forward earlier to avoid having to " run the gauntlet . " without providing further details , the paper alleged the episode , which it said occurred in kabul , was not an isolated incident and did not publish any photographs associated with the non-commissioned officer 's allegations . ministry promises to investigate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants any soldiers involved to come forward immediately a spokesperson for the defense ministry called on anyone with knowledge of the incident or others like it to come forward immediately in order to " quickly investigate the allegations . " " we call on whoever is claiming this to provide us with the necessary proof without delay so that we can investigate the allegation thoroughly and quickly , " a ministry spokesman said . winfried nachtwei , the opposition green party 's spokesman on security affairs , said the charges needed to be cleared up as soon as possible .
nachtwei told rbb radio these allegations of abuse , if proved true , would be much more serious than other scandals that have recently troubled the bundeswehr . " this would have a different quality than the macabre , obscene games with skeletons , " he said .
" because here a child could have been tormented , and this goes diametrically against the bundeswehr 's orders . " parliament wants more information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition parties what to know exactly what training german troops get the issue needs to be addressed in wednesday 's meeting of the parliament 's defense committee , according to birgit homburger , a member of the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " the fdp is calling for an inspection with the goal of determining what types of training and preparation soldiers receive when they are deployed , " she said . sunday 's allegations come on the heels of photographs published at the end of october showing german troops desecrating skulls and bones in afghanistan , and a separate set of photos showing soldiers driving a jeep painted with a slightly altered version of the insignia used by nazi soldiers . military officials last week said they had suspended a total of six soldiers about their roles in the skull desecration while questioning over 20 others for additional information . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new photos link elite german soldiers to nazi emblem the german defense ministry said six soldiers were suspended in connection with a scandal involving troops desecrating skulls found in afghanistan , while new photos of soldiers using a nazi-era emblem have also surfaced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 06.11.2006 making sense of new eu airport security regulations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bag it or lose it : new eu regulations are very clear on what you can and ca n't carry on board the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .
dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .
this corresponds to the already valid rules of the international air traffic authority -lrb- iata -rrb- .
each aircraft passenger may bring along only one piece of hand baggage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa chief calls for modernized airport security measures the united states have refined airline security measures , adjusting the liquid ban implemented in august , but the head of german airline lufthansa said searching bags is not the ideal way to catch terrorists anyway .

the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 06.11.2006 " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans vote for the house of representatives and one-third of the senate will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?
americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?

in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .
otherwise we will have a very , very serious situation in terms of the continuation of accession talks , " merkel said .
" i call on turkey to do everything not to get into this situation and not to lead the european union into this situation . " we do n't want a political confrontation .
but the requirement is that turkey in particular budges , " merkel added .
" the eu can not simply go on as it has done .
turkey must understand that there will be no simple ' carry on ' if there is no movement on cyprus . " however , government sources told german press agency dpa that the current frosty state of relations over cyprus did not mean berlin would seek a break-off of the accession talks , but rather a suspension of sub-sections of those talks . turkey-cyprus dispute threatening accession hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops patrol the border crossing in cyprus cyprus , divided since 1974 when turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece , has become one of the biggest obstacles to turkey 's membership talks with the eu , which began last year . under a customs union agreement with the bloc , ankara must open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , an eu member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize . but turkey refuses to do so until the eu eases the international isolation of the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , as it promised to do after turkish cypriots voted in favor of a un settlement plan to reunify the island in april 2004 . ankara says greek cypriots , who voted down the peace plan , are using their eu membership as leverage to hamper turkey 's bid and extract concessions in the cyprus conflict . relations less cordial under merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship relations between merkel 's government and the turkish administration have continued to become more strained over eu accession than was the case with the previous german red-green coalition under gerhard schröder . under schröder , germany was a key backer of turkey 's bid to become the eu 's first mainly muslim member .
however , merkel 's conservatives prefer offering turkey only a " privileged partnership . " apart from turkey 's accession and the cyprus dispute , the german cabinet on sunday set out germany 's objectives as president of the 25-nation bloc , confirming that it would revive efforts to pass an eu constitutional treaty . merkel told reporters after sunday 's specially convened cabinet meeting that she would try to use germany 's six-month presidency to press eu members to salvage the constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums last year , partly because of concerns about expansion . germany targets eu constitution resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to revive the constitution in 2007 however , she admitted that any result would probably come late in germany 's january-to-june presidency ; given that little could be agreed before the french presidential elections due to conclude in may . " substantial questions such as the constitution will probably have to be decided after the elections in france , " she said . germany is against plans for the stripping down of the constitution , which is supposed to streamline decision-making and create the post of eu foreign minister and to make it more acceptable to voters . merkel said officials must demonstrate to citizens that the union is " pragmatic and manageable . "
she also said the union would have to " live and mature " before it can embark on any further wave of expansion . germany would propose a " berlin declaration " on eu values when eu leaders meet at a summit in the city next march , merkel added . during its coming eu presidency , the cabinet stated that germany would also stress energy policy , the fight to stem climate change and establishing a better partnership with africa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu climate change strategy europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the kyoto protocol expires , german chancellor merkel after a meeting with british prime minister blair .

the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 06.11.2006 making sense of new eu airport security regulations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bag it or lose it : new eu regulations are very clear on what you can and ca n't carry on board the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .
dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .

all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .
this corresponds to the already valid rules of the international air traffic authority -lrb- iata -rrb- .
each aircraft passenger may bring along only one piece of hand baggage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa chief calls for modernized airport security measures the united states have refined airline security measures , adjusting the liquid ban implemented in august , but the head of german airline lufthansa said searching bags is not the ideal way to catch terrorists anyway .

" the boy was incredibly scared until he realized that he was not really going to be shot , " the paper quoted the solider as saying .
the boy was then given a dollar as " a reward . " the witness was quoted as saying he did not come forward earlier to avoid having to " run the gauntlet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.11.2006 germany 's eu presidency plans marred by turkey dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkey issue is likely to hang over merkel and germany 's eu presidency in 2007 reviving the constitution , solving energy problems , tackling global warming and improving african relations : germany has big plans for its eu presidency in 2007 .
in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .
otherwise we will have a very , very serious situation in terms of the continuation of accession talks , " merkel said .
" i call on turkey to do everything not to get into this situation and not to lead the european union into this situation . " we do n't want a political confrontation .
but the requirement is that turkey in particular budges , " merkel added .
" the eu can not simply go on as it has done .
turkey must understand that there will be no simple ' carry on ' if there is no movement on cyprus . " however , government sources told german press agency dpa that the current frosty state of relations over cyprus did not mean berlin would seek a break-off of the accession talks , but rather a suspension of sub-sections of those talks . turkey-cyprus dispute threatening accession hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops patrol the border crossing in cyprus cyprus , divided since 1974 when turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece , has become one of the biggest obstacles to turkey 's membership talks with the eu , which began last year . under a customs union agreement with the bloc , ankara must open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , an eu member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize . but turkey refuses to do so until the eu eases the international isolation of the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , as it promised to do after turkish cypriots voted in favor of a un settlement plan to reunify the island in april 2004 . ankara says greek cypriots , who voted down the peace plan , are using their eu membership as leverage to hamper turkey 's bid and extract concessions in the cyprus conflict . relations less cordial under merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship relations between merkel 's government and the turkish administration have continued to become more strained over eu accession than was the case with the previous german red-green coalition under gerhard schröder . under schröder , germany was a key backer of turkey 's bid to become the eu 's first mainly muslim member .
however , merkel 's conservatives prefer offering turkey only a " privileged partnership . " apart from turkey 's accession and the cyprus dispute , the german cabinet on sunday set out germany 's objectives as president of the 25-nation bloc , confirming that it would revive efforts to pass an eu constitutional treaty . merkel told reporters after sunday 's specially convened cabinet meeting that she would try to use germany 's six-month presidency to press eu members to salvage the constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums last year , partly because of concerns about expansion . germany targets eu constitution resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to revive the constitution in 2007 however , she admitted that any result would probably come late in germany 's january-to-june presidency ; given that little could be agreed before the french presidential elections due to conclude in may . " substantial questions such as the constitution will probably have to be decided after the elections in france , " she said . germany is against plans for the stripping down of the constitution , which is supposed to streamline decision-making and create the post of eu foreign minister and to make it more acceptable to voters . merkel said officials must demonstrate to citizens that the union is " pragmatic and manageable . "
she also said the union would have to " live and mature " before it can embark on any further wave of expansion . germany would propose a " berlin declaration " on eu values when eu leaders meet at a summit in the city next march , merkel added . during its coming eu presidency , the cabinet stated that germany would also stress energy policy , the fight to stem climate change and establishing a better partnership with africa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu climate change strategy europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the kyoto protocol expires , german chancellor merkel after a meeting with british prime minister blair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 06.11.2006 making sense of new eu airport security regulations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bag it or lose it : new eu regulations are very clear on what you can and ca n't carry on board the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .
dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?

i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .

for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .

i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?

dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .
this corresponds to the already valid rules of the international air traffic authority -lrb- iata -rrb- .
each aircraft passenger may bring along only one piece of hand baggage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa chief calls for modernized airport security measures the united states have refined airline security measures , adjusting the liquid ban implemented in august , but the head of german airline lufthansa said searching bags is not the ideal way to catch terrorists anyway .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 06.11.2006 corruption a cause of poverty in the developing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's sometimes impossible to get ahead without waving money in front of the right eyes berlin-based transparency international released its annual corruption report monday .
the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake .
-lrb- 29.03.2006 -rrb- corruption catches up with germany a report published by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb .
-lrb- 19.12.2005 -rrb- fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen stepped down as chief of transparency international .
the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself .

16 championships . wannabe bottle spinning champions will sit in circles of four around tables .

" in a statement , released by the information department of the german government , released early on monday , merkel said saddam should " fully bear consequences of his acts like any other iraqi citizen . " great britain , one of the main powers behind the invasion of iraq , was among the few western countries to give an openly positive reception to sunday 's verdict . " i welcome that saddam hussein and the other defendants have faced justice and have been held to account for their crimes , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said in a statement after the baghdad court 's decision . " appalling crimes were committed by saddam hussein 's regime .
it is right that those accused of such crimes against the iraqi people should face iraqi justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi judge needed to shout to be heard in the noisy courtroom " today 's verdict and sentences by the iraqi higher tribunal come at the end of a trial during which evidence has been offered and challenged in the full glare of media scrutiny , " she said . a visibly shaken hussein was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity for his role in ordering the deaths of 148 shiite villagers in the town of dujail in 1982 , the verdict does not address alleged crimes committed by the former leader during campaigns against iran , the kurds or kuwait . hussein 's half-brother barzan al-tikriti and another aide will also hang if automatic appeals fail in the coming months . general european opposition to death sentence spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said the former iraqi dictator should be held accountable for his actions , but added that spain remains firmly opposed the death penalty .
the death penalty is illegal across the entire 25-member european union . swedish foreign minister bildt called saddam verdict " deeply satisfying , " while dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said he was pleased hussein 's " reign of terror " was brought to an end . " justice has been served for what he did , " balkenende told national public television , adding that the netherlands also is opposed to the death penalty . questions remain on future of iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions in iraq were divided along religious lines france 's foreign minister philippe douste-blazy focused his remarks on iraq 's future , saying he hoped the already bloody sectarian strife in the country would not worsen as a result of the death sentence . " i hope this decision will not lead to new tensions and that the iraqis will show restraint , whatever community they belong to , " he said . initial reactions in iraq were split along religious lines with shiites , the majority group now in power but oppressed under hussein , celebrating the verdict while sunnis , the group that held power under hussein , condemned it as propaganda designed to serve us president george w. bush before elections tuesday in the united states . human rights organizations denounce verdict human rights groups slammed the trial for not providing victims with a clear record of facts of what occurred under hussein 's dictatorship and emphasized their rejection of the death penalty under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups said the trial was flawed " it was a lost opportunity to give a sense of the rule of law and a loss for the victims in that the trial and verdict are unlikely to stand the test of time , " human rights watch director for international justice richard dicker told the afp news agency . amnesty international condemned the sentence , describing the trial as a " shabby affair , marred by serious flaws . " the london-based human rights group said the trial should have helped the process of establishing justice and the rule of law in iraq but was in fact " deeply flawed and unfair . " three defense lawyers were killed in the course of the trial , and a previous chief judge resigned over government interference . un human rights chief louise arbour called for a moratorium on executions after former iraqi president saddam hussein was sentenced to death by an iraqi court and expressed her wish that the rights of the defendants to a fair appeal to be " fully respected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 06.11.2006 " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans vote for the house of representatives and one-third of the senate will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?
americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
the quickest end possible to the bush administration to stop him from implementing any more ridiculous policies . interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hits out at us sanctioning of secret prisons german chancellor merkel , who has worked to boost ties with the us since taking office , rebuked washington on the use of secret prisons by the cia - admitted for the first time by us president bush .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?

in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .

most commentators worried the death penalty sent the wrong signals .
some felt justice had been served . iraq should have done away with the death penalty to signal a fresh start in the post-saddam era , according to the berliner zeitung .
" the abolishment of the death penalty belongs to the most important achievements of democracy , " the paper wrote .
" when western european politicians welcome the death sentence , it shows their moral and political bankruptcy . " " not many humans will find genuine satisfaction in the judgement against saddam hussein , " the stuttgarter zeitung wrote .
" the islamist world will view -lrb- the verdict -rrb- as victor 's justice . " " for president george w. bush , the sentence for saddam is without a doubt a political success that he very much needs ... but he should n't forget that the iraq liberated from its dictator remains ungovernable , " the leipziger volkszeitung commented . spain 's el pais condemned the use of the death penalty .
saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .
and it is british troops who will be in the firing line if there is any backlash , " uk 's the mirror wrote . the guardian said that if " a new iraq is to ever ... emerge from the ruins of the old , eschewing judicial murder would be a good start . " the sun rejected such arguments as liberal hand-wringing .

the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .

only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .

all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .

most commentators worried the death penalty sent the wrong signals .
some felt justice had been served . iraq should have done away with the death penalty to signal a fresh start in the post-saddam era , according to the berliner zeitung .
" the abolishment of the death penalty belongs to the most important achievements of democracy , " the paper wrote .
" when western european politicians welcome the death sentence , it shows their moral and political bankruptcy . " " not many humans will find genuine satisfaction in the judgement against saddam hussein , " the stuttgarter zeitung wrote .
" the islamist world will view -lrb- the verdict -rrb- as victor 's justice . " " for president george w. bush , the sentence for saddam is without a doubt a political success that he very much needs ... but he should n't forget that the iraq liberated from its dictator remains ungovernable , " the leipziger volkszeitung commented . spain 's el pais condemned the use of the death penalty .
saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .
and it is british troops who will be in the firing line if there is any backlash , " uk 's the mirror wrote . the guardian said that if " a new iraq is to ever ... emerge from the ruins of the old , eschewing judicial murder would be a good start . " the sun rejected such arguments as liberal hand-wringing .
" there can be no more fitting end than a hangman 's noose for this gangster-turned-president , " the paper 's editorial declared . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans aim for better ties with middle east world bank president paul wolfowitz , german and arab officials and business leaders are meeting this week to help refocus attention on improving germany 's ties with the middle east .
europeans divided on saddam death sentence while political leaders across europe said saddam hussein should be held accountable for his actions , they also expressed their opposition to the death penalty the former iraqi dictator received on sunday .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- report : germans allegedly gave iraq 's defense plan to us germany passed intelligence on saddam hussein 's plan to defend baghdad to us commanders a month before the united states invaded , according to a news report .

most commentators worried the death penalty sent the wrong signals .
some felt justice had been served . iraq should have done away with the death penalty to signal a fresh start in the post-saddam era , according to the berliner zeitung .
" the abolishment of the death penalty belongs to the most important achievements of democracy , " the paper wrote .
" when western european politicians welcome the death sentence , it shows their moral and political bankruptcy . " " not many humans will find genuine satisfaction in the judgement against saddam hussein , " the stuttgarter zeitung wrote .
" the islamist world will view -lrb- the verdict -rrb- as victor 's justice . " " for president george w. bush , the sentence for saddam is without a doubt a political success that he very much needs ... but he should n't forget that the iraq liberated from its dictator remains ungovernable , " the leipziger volkszeitung commented . spain 's el pais condemned the use of the death penalty .
saddam 's execution " would very likely make him a martyr for his supporters in the sunni community , and make a return to calm in the country even more difficult . " france 's la figaro wrote : " it 's a shame the verdict can give the impression of legitimizing a military intervention taken under false pretexts , when it should be before all else a founding act for a state based on the rule of law after 24 years of dictatorship . " " he may have been a brutal dictator , but there is every risk his hanging will bring more bloodshed ... we have seen too many false dawns before in iraq to have much hope the death of saddam will be a turning point for the good .
and it is british troops who will be in the firing line if there is any backlash , " uk 's the mirror wrote . the guardian said that if " a new iraq is to ever ... emerge from the ruins of the old , eschewing judicial murder would be a good start . " the sun rejected such arguments as liberal hand-wringing .
" there can be no more fitting end than a hangman 's noose for this gangster-turned-president , " the paper 's editorial declared . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans aim for better ties with middle east world bank president paul wolfowitz , german and arab officials and business leaders are meeting this week to help refocus attention on improving germany 's ties with the middle east .
europeans divided on saddam death sentence while political leaders across europe said saddam hussein should be held accountable for his actions , they also expressed their opposition to the death penalty the former iraqi dictator received on sunday .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- report : germans allegedly gave iraq 's defense plan to us germany passed intelligence on saddam hussein 's plan to defend baghdad to us commanders a month before the united states invaded , according to a news report .

in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .

turkey must understand that there will be no simple ' carry on ' if there is no movement on cyprus . " however , government sources told german press agency dpa that the current frosty state of relations over cyprus did not mean berlin would seek a break-off of the accession talks , but rather a suspension of sub-sections of those talks . turkey-cyprus dispute threatening accession hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops patrol the border crossing in cyprus cyprus , divided since 1974 when turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece , has become one of the biggest obstacles to turkey 's membership talks with the eu , which began last year . under a customs union agreement with the bloc , ankara must open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , an eu member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize . but turkey refuses to do so until the eu eases the international isolation of the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , as it promised to do after turkish cypriots voted in favor of a un settlement plan to reunify the island in april 2004 . ankara says greek cypriots , who voted down the peace plan , are using their eu membership as leverage to hamper turkey 's bid and extract concessions in the cyprus conflict . relations less cordial under merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship relations between merkel 's government and the turkish administration have continued to become more strained over eu accession than was the case with the previous german red-green coalition under gerhard schröder . under schröder , germany was a key backer of turkey 's bid to become the eu 's first mainly muslim member .
however , merkel 's conservatives prefer offering turkey only a " privileged partnership . " apart from turkey 's accession and the cyprus dispute , the german cabinet on sunday set out germany 's objectives as president of the 25-nation bloc , confirming that it would revive efforts to pass an eu constitutional treaty . merkel told reporters after sunday 's specially convened cabinet meeting that she would try to use germany 's six-month presidency to press eu members to salvage the constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums last year , partly because of concerns about expansion . germany targets eu constitution resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to revive the constitution in 2007 however , she admitted that any result would probably come late in germany 's january-to-june presidency ; given that little could be agreed before the french presidential elections due to conclude in may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 06.11.2006 germany 's eu presidency plans marred by turkey dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkey issue is likely to hang over merkel and germany 's eu presidency in 2007 reviving the constitution , solving energy problems , tackling global warming and improving african relations : germany has big plans for its eu presidency in 2007 .
in addition , it now faces a growing dispute with turkey . the german cabinet met on sunday to plan germany 's coming european union presidency under a cloud of discontent after current eu president finland scrapped planned meetings with turkish and cypriot officials this weekend . finland drew up a plan to solve the dispute but cancelled the meeting after turkish and cypriot officials failed to agree on the terms of the talks . german chancellor angela merkel , riled by turkey 's unwillingness to give ground on the cyprus issue and the abandonment of talks on the topic , warned that turkey 's bid to join the eu was in jeopardy due to the worsening dispute with cyprus . in a candid interview published in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily , merkel said she hoped that the cancellation of talks between the eu , turkey and cyprus would " not be the last word " but added that any failure to resolve the growing crisis would severely damage turkey 's chances of joining the bloc . merkel , whose country assumes the rotating six-month presidency of the eu in january , said the continuance of accession discussions would depend on how turkey responded to the eu 's demands on progress . merkel warns of serious situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks could be in jeopardy " we need the implementation of the ankara protocol about the free movement of goods with states including cyprus .
otherwise we will have a very , very serious situation in terms of the continuation of accession talks , " merkel said .
" i call on turkey to do everything not to get into this situation and not to lead the european union into this situation . " we do n't want a political confrontation .
but the requirement is that turkey in particular budges , " merkel added .
" the eu can not simply go on as it has done .
turkey must understand that there will be no simple ' carry on ' if there is no movement on cyprus . " however , government sources told german press agency dpa that the current frosty state of relations over cyprus did not mean berlin would seek a break-off of the accession talks , but rather a suspension of sub-sections of those talks . turkey-cyprus dispute threatening accession hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops patrol the border crossing in cyprus cyprus , divided since 1974 when turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in response to a greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece , has become one of the biggest obstacles to turkey 's membership talks with the eu , which began last year . under a customs union agreement with the bloc , ankara must open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , an eu member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize . but turkey refuses to do so until the eu eases the international isolation of the self-proclaimed turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , as it promised to do after turkish cypriots voted in favor of a un settlement plan to reunify the island in april 2004 . ankara says greek cypriots , who voted down the peace plan , are using their eu membership as leverage to hamper turkey 's bid and extract concessions in the cyprus conflict . relations less cordial under merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan and schröder enjoyed a warm relationship relations between merkel 's government and the turkish administration have continued to become more strained over eu accession than was the case with the previous german red-green coalition under gerhard schröder . under schröder , germany was a key backer of turkey 's bid to become the eu 's first mainly muslim member .
however , merkel 's conservatives prefer offering turkey only a " privileged partnership . " apart from turkey 's accession and the cyprus dispute , the german cabinet on sunday set out germany 's objectives as president of the 25-nation bloc , confirming that it would revive efforts to pass an eu constitutional treaty . merkel told reporters after sunday 's specially convened cabinet meeting that she would try to use germany 's six-month presidency to press eu members to salvage the constitution , which was rejected in french and dutch referendums last year , partly because of concerns about expansion . germany targets eu constitution resurrection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to revive the constitution in 2007 however , she admitted that any result would probably come late in germany 's january-to-june presidency ; given that little could be agreed before the french presidential elections due to conclude in may . " substantial questions such as the constitution will probably have to be decided after the elections in france , " she said . germany is against plans for the stripping down of the constitution , which is supposed to streamline decision-making and create the post of eu foreign minister and to make it more acceptable to voters . merkel said officials must demonstrate to citizens that the union is " pragmatic and manageable . "
she also said the union would have to " live and mature " before it can embark on any further wave of expansion . germany would propose a " berlin declaration " on eu values when eu leaders meet at a summit in the city next march , merkel added . during its coming eu presidency , the cabinet stated that germany would also stress energy policy , the fight to stem climate change and establishing a better partnership with africa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu climate change strategy europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the kyoto protocol expires , german chancellor merkel after a meeting with british prime minister blair .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .

to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .

" in a statement , released by the information department of the german government , released early on monday , merkel said saddam should " fully bear consequences of his acts like any other iraqi citizen . " great britain , one of the main powers behind the invasion of iraq , was among the few western countries to give an openly positive reception to sunday 's verdict . " i welcome that saddam hussein and the other defendants have faced justice and have been held to account for their crimes , " foreign secretary margaret beckett said in a statement after the baghdad court 's decision . " appalling crimes were committed by saddam hussein 's regime .
it is right that those accused of such crimes against the iraqi people should face iraqi justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi judge needed to shout to be heard in the noisy courtroom " today 's verdict and sentences by the iraqi higher tribunal come at the end of a trial during which evidence has been offered and challenged in the full glare of media scrutiny , " she said . a visibly shaken hussein was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity for his role in ordering the deaths of 148 shiite villagers in the town of dujail in 1982 , the verdict does not address alleged crimes committed by the former leader during campaigns against iran , the kurds or kuwait . hussein 's half-brother barzan al-tikriti and another aide will also hang if automatic appeals fail in the coming months . general european opposition to death sentence spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said the former iraqi dictator should be held accountable for his actions , but added that spain remains firmly opposed the death penalty .
the death penalty is illegal across the entire 25-member european union . swedish foreign minister bildt called saddam verdict " deeply satisfying , " while dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said he was pleased hussein 's " reign of terror " was brought to an end . " justice has been served for what he did , " balkenende told national public television , adding that the netherlands also is opposed to the death penalty . questions remain on future of iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions in iraq were divided along religious lines france 's foreign minister philippe douste-blazy focused his remarks on iraq 's future , saying he hoped the already bloody sectarian strife in the country would not worsen as a result of the death sentence . " i hope this decision will not lead to new tensions and that the iraqis will show restraint , whatever community they belong to , " he said . initial reactions in iraq were split along religious lines with shiites , the majority group now in power but oppressed under hussein , celebrating the verdict while sunnis , the group that held power under hussein , condemned it as propaganda designed to serve us president george w. bush before elections tuesday in the united states . human rights organizations denounce verdict human rights groups slammed the trial for not providing victims with a clear record of facts of what occurred under hussein 's dictatorship and emphasized their rejection of the death penalty under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups said the trial was flawed " it was a lost opportunity to give a sense of the rule of law and a loss for the victims in that the trial and verdict are unlikely to stand the test of time , " human rights watch director for international justice richard dicker told the afp news agency . amnesty international condemned the sentence , describing the trial as a " shabby affair , marred by serious flaws . " the london-based human rights group said the trial should have helped the process of establishing justice and the rule of law in iraq but was in fact " deeply flawed and unfair . " three defense lawyers were killed in the course of the trial , and a previous chief judge resigned over government interference . un human rights chief louise arbour called for a moratorium on executions after former iraqi president saddam hussein was sentenced to death by an iraqi court and expressed her wish that the rights of the defendants to a fair appeal to be " fully respected .

americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake . fred irwin , president of american chamber of commerce , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
from the mood of the country , it seems that the democrats will gain both in the house and in the senate .
the question is whether they will take over both houses .
i predict that they 're not going take over the senate and that they 'll come very close in the house , but that the republicans will maintain control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls ahead of tuesday 's election do n't contain much good news for bush what are the key issues ?
iraq , iraq , iraq .
that is the question in this election .
most people feel that if the democrats win they will find a plan to pull the troops home and if republicans win they 'll either increase troop strength in iraq or maintain the status quo .
there are also only secondary local issues concerning minimum wage , the rising costs of prescription drugs , the economy .
some people feel that if the republicans win they 'll need more money for the war so they 'll raise taxes . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
for the country , the best result is if 70 percent of the electorate goes to the polls .
the apathy among american voters does not do the country good , and i 'm hoping an issue like iraq is going to draw them to the polls .
then it will be the right outcome . mary roper , english teacher in germany for two years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many said the war in iraq is the biggest issue in tueseday 's elections how will the elections go ?
i have n't heard that much about it , but i hope that the democrats will be able to pull it off .
i think that might happen , but i know that they 're 15 seats behind . what are the key issues ?
the biggest issue is iraq and foreign policy .
since the war started it has been the biggest issue . embryonic stem cell research has also come up with some candidates . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i 'm not really a democrat or a republican .
i prefer going with the best candidate .
but this time around i think democratic would be the best result because it would divide the government and that would change bush 's current agenda a little bit . mike jansen , independent business consultant , in germany for 26 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california gov. arnold schwarzenegger is likely to win re-election how will the elections go ?
the democrats are going to win .
the only republican who is going to win is schwarzenegger because of the environmental issues , which are big out there and the way he handled other issues when he made mistakes in the past . what are the key issues ?
for americans , one of the main issues is the war in iraq because of all the people dying over there , and bush has lost the people 's faith and not really come out and told the whole story to the american public . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
to be honest i do n't even think americans care about politics because they do n't believe in the politicians .
only very few rich people are into politics .
the majority of americans have other issues : how they 're going to earn money and pay for health insurance .
they 're not into politics the way germans are . carol kloeppel , television producer , in germany for 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been campaigning for republicans in close races how will the elections go ?
i think that the democrats will win back a lot of seats . what are the key issues ?
the war , the war and the war - and america 's reputation abroad . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i think that we need to have a better balance of power again .
it 's been too republican and there 've been too many things that have not gone right , and we need to have a stronger democratic presence to balance that out again .
and i would be really happy to get rid of the president , but we ca n't . dave lemus , financial ceo of bio-tech company morphosys in germany for eight years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the republicans currently hold a majority in the us congress how will the elections go ?
conventional wisdom says the democrats will prevail in 2006 . the house looks to be a certainty and only a matter of degree .
the senate could turn democratic if things get real ugly . what are the key issues ?
the iraq war and the foley political scandal , amongst others . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
i have never viewed change as necessarily negative . david fisher , information technology consultant , in germany for 36 years how will the elections go ?
i hope the republicans lose in both houses .
that would be a dream come true . what are the key issues ?
the main issue is that george bush is running a concentration camp that is against the constitution and is trying to justify torture .
he 's an absolute disaster and the worst president in the history of the united states . what would be the best outcome for the country ?
the quickest end possible to the bush administration to stop him from implementing any more ridiculous policies . interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hits out at us sanctioning of secret prisons german chancellor merkel , who has worked to boost ties with the us since taking office , rebuked washington on the use of secret prisons by the cia - admitted for the first time by us president bush .

corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .

it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .

all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 06.11.2006 corruption a cause of poverty in the developing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's sometimes impossible to get ahead without waving money in front of the right eyes berlin-based transparency international released its annual corruption report monday .
the agency 's head , david nussbaum , talked to deutsche welle about corruption and its consequences . the 2006 corruption perceptions index -lrb- cpi -rrb- looked at public sector corruption in 163 countries .
nearly half of them scored below three points , indicating rampant perceived corruption .
corruption and poverty often go hand-in-hand , according to the of the 2006 cpi . dw-radio : how does your report go about measuring corruption ? david nussbaum : we use 12 independent surveys done by nine different organizations .
they survey thousands of people around the world to see how they perceive corruption in one country compared to another .
we then synthesize that into one integrated report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ti head david nussbaum what type of overall picture does this year 's report paint of corruption in the world ? well , it clearly indicates corruption continues to be a very serious problem .
it 's a problem for governments because it means that the machine of government is n't operating the way it 's supposed to .
it 's a serious issue for business because corruption increases the risks and decreases returns on investments .
but above all , it has a devastating impact on ordinary people who have to live in a country where corruption is rife .
it means they ca n't get the goods and services they should be able to without paying bribes and it means the resources in their country may be expropriated to other parts of the world by corrupt elites .
it devastates their lives . can you give us an idea of which countries tend to be more or less corrupt ? at the very bottom you have haiti , myanmar and iraq where corruption is extremely bad .
and at the other end you have finland , iceland and new zealand .
life is very different if you live in a country where corruption has been brought under control . is there a correlation between poverty and corruption ? there certainly seems to be a correlation between income levels and levels of corruption .
corruption causes poverty .
that 's why we think it 's so important that government and business focus on this issue . how can this list be used to reduce corruption ? i think the governments should see this as a real call to action .
there are no countries that score perfectly .
all countries have issues with corruption .
once you get below the top very few , the scores fall away quite quickly .
secondly , for businesses , what this list does is call attention to those countries where business operators need to take extra measures to mitigate the risks of corruption effecting their business .
ultimately , this is a call to the people of the world to demand action by their leaders and hold them accountable . nathan witkop interviewed david nussbaum -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when transparency international gets cloudy unhappy when a recently-fired employee 's complaints ended up on a blog , transparency international hired lawyers to force the postings off the internet .
big mistake .
-lrb- 29.03.2006 -rrb- corruption catches up with germany a report published by transparency international shows that germans believe corruption is gaining ground when it comes to crime .
public faith in the morals of politicians is at a particularly low ebb .
-lrb- 19.12.2005 -rrb- fighting global corruption from germany twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen stepped down as chief of transparency international .
the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 06.11.2006 making sense of new eu airport security regulations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bag it or lose it : new eu regulations are very clear on what you can and ca n't carry on board the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .
dw-world.de answers some of the most pressing questions passengers could be asking . the eu introduced strict new security measures on hand baggage across european airports monday , restricting the amount of liquids passengers can bring with them on board planes .
the rules take affect as of monday at all airports within the 25-nation eu and in norway , iceland and switzerland . the new regulations will limit passengers to carrying no more than 100 milliliters -lrb- a fifth of a pint -rrb- of liquid per container .
all such containers should fit into a clear re-sealable plastic bag to be presented at security checkpoints . all liquids will be subject to security checks prior to boarding planes and include not only water and soft drinks , but also soups , creams , lotions , oils , perfumes , sprays , gels , toothpaste and shaving cream . the new rules do not affect liquids packed in checked luggage or drinks and perfumes bought at airport shops after passengers clear security . baby foods and medicines are also exempt , but can be subject to inspection , officials said . the eu agreed to tighten airport security measures after british authorities said in august they had broken up a terrorist plot to bring down us-bound flights with liquid-based explosives . here dw-world.de presents a list of possible questions aircraft passengers may be asking themselves in regard to the new eu security measures regarding baggage and liquids on flights . when and on which flights do the new rules apply ? the new regulations come into force and are applied from november 6 , 2006 on all flights which start in the eu as well as those in switzerland , norway and iceland , regardless of the flight destination or the nationality of airline .
they also apply to all passengers who change flights at any airport in the eu . what do the new regulations state ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those not adhering to the rules will lose their liquids the new eu security guidelines say that passengers should only carry liquid in 100ml containers on board and that the total amount of liquid should not exceed a liter .
all liquid containers should be carried in a transparent plastic bag .
the regulations only apply to liquid in hand luggage .
bottles of liquid can be packed normally in suitcases that are checked in . what liquids are being regulated ? pretty much everything .
the new eu rules do n't only apply to drinks and perfumes but also liquids and gels in various forms such as shaving-foam , sprays , shampoos , liquid soaps , sun lotions , oils , creams , deodorants , lip-gloss and toothpastes . so is water being regulated ? yes , since water can not be differentiated quickly and positively from other liquids at points of control .
after the check point , passengers can buy water at the duty free shops and on-board catering services . why do the new regulations apply to the liquids mentioned ? because explosives can be manufactured in pure liquid and gel form . are there any exceptions in the regulations concerning liquids ? exceptions have been made for baby food , milk or juice for travelers with babies or infants .
medicines or insulin and juices for diabetics may also be brought on board without restriction and do not need to be carried in plastic bags .
passengers must declare the liquids they intend to carry on board in these cases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials will be able to search the plastic bags there are still controls in place however .
as a precautionary measure , inspection personnel who have doubts may ask passengers to prove what is carried is an appropriate medicine or necessary substance for the flight .
therefore it is wise to bring a medical certificate or appropriate documents of identification with you . how should the plastic bags look ? passengers can use any bag which is transparent and lockable .
simple plastic bags , which are secured with a rubber band , are not permitted .
the bag may not exceed the capacity of a liter .
a locking device or zip on the bag to reduce the possibility of spillage is required .
only one bag is permitted to each aircraft passenger . where do i get the plastic bags ? standard lockable freezer bags from a supermarket are the best example .
they cost approximately 10cent per bag in europe .
many airports will make plastic bags with zippers available from monday .
specially manufactured bags for the carrying of liquids on flights are likely to appear in high street and airport shops in the future . can i still buy perfumes or alcohol in the duty free shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : items that do n't fit the profile will be confiscated yes .
all duty free products , which are bought after the safety check , may be brought on board .
perfumes or alcohol should be sealed however by the shops in " manipulation-proof bags , " which may not be opened before the flight .
otherwise the goods could be seized at the last control check or point of transfer .
a receipt must be kept with the item and only items bought on the day of travel will be admitted . what happens with duty free articles , which are bought in a non-eu country ? if you land with duty free articles from a non-eu country in germany and if your journey continues on another flight , there may be problems at the security check .
alcohol or perfumes would have to be left at the control point . how will security checks be run in the future ? bags with containers of liquids will be presented separately from hand luggage at control points .
it will be at the discretion of the officials whether the liquids will be opened or x-rayed .
as before , coats will have to be removed , laptops switched on and , in the united kingdom , shoes will be removed and passed through the x-ray machine . do passengers face even longer waiting times ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers can expect long delays - but not this long the airports are expecting longer control times .
travelers should arrive promptly and be patient .
the german federal ministry of the interior advises that passengers pack all non-essential liquids into suitcases before check-in .
this will save time at the security check .
the new rules concern only the hand baggage ; passengers have access to during the flight . are there any additional changes ? at the beginning of may 2007 , a stricter regulation for the size of the hand baggage will come into operation .
bags will be restricted to the size 56x45x25 cm .
this corresponds to the already valid rules of the international air traffic authority -lrb- iata -rrb- .
each aircraft passenger may bring along only one piece of hand baggage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : lufthansa chief calls for modernized airport security measures the united states have refined airline security measures , adjusting the liquid ban implemented in august , but the head of german airline lufthansa said searching bags is not the ideal way to catch terrorists anyway .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- dw-world : passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said wednesday it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

the kuomintang party is planning to table a motion in parliament which , if successful , will force a public vote on whether to recall the president .
mr chen has faced crises before , but after prosecutors said on friday they had evidence to charge him with graft , he faces his toughest challenge yet .
in a televised speech on sunday , the president proclaimed his innocence .
" i must ask everyone , could a-bian be this kind of crooked fellow ? " he said , referring to himself by his nickname .
mr chen can not be prosecuted while in office as he is protected by presidential immunity , but his wife and three ex-aides were charged with the misuse of state funds .
he has lost the people 's trust and respect ma ying-jeou opposition nationalist party taiwanese give their reaction in his speech , mr chen promised to resign if his wife was convicted , but he again refuted the prosecutors ' claims on friday that he and his family embezzled 14.8m taiwan dollars -lrb- us $ 450,000 -rrb- .
the address failed to calm investors .
the island 's stock market fell 1.7 % when trading began on monday .
third attempt the main opposition kuomintang party will formally propose the recall motion in parliament on friday , according to spokesman tsai chin-lung .
" we sincerely urge our colleagues from the ruling party and other groups to support our move , " he said .
if it passes , the recall motion will trigger a national referendum on whether to get rid of the president .
but the opposition parties , which have a small majority in parliament , will need at least 14 ruling party members to back the motion in order for it to succeed .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims .
charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen .
again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity testing times the last two attempts - in june and october - failed as all mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- colleagues stood by him .
analysts say the big question now is whether the prosecutors ' conclusions last friday will cause some dpp lawmakers to lose faith in their leader and vote in favour of the recall motion .
already some ruling party members are asking mr chen to take a look at his position .
" i suggest the president take time off and concentrate on the trial until a verdict is announced , " said one lawmaker , cheng yun-peng .
dpp chairman yu shyi-kun told the associated press that the party would meet on wednesday to discuss the current situation .
' unacceptable ' in his long-awaited tv address on sunday , mr chen told supporters that the charges against him were " unacceptable " .
protesters have taken to the streets to call for his resignation " the indictment is nothing but a death sentence to politicians , " he said .
mr chen said he " decided to face the prosecutors ' questioning and investigation because i had nothing to hide " , and that he was " willing to resign if the judge convicts me of corruption " .
but he said he had no motive for corruption , and pointed out that he had voluntarily halved his own presidential salary - funds which were far larger than the amount of money allegedly embezzled .
the tv address is being regarded as one of the most important speeches in president chen 's political career , according to the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei .
but while mr chen rebutted the allegations against him , he gave no details about the destination of unaccounted public funds , our correspondent says .

the kuomintang party is planning to table a motion in parliament which , if successful , will force a public vote on whether to recall the president .
mr chen has faced crises before , but after prosecutors said on friday they had evidence to charge him with graft , he faces his toughest challenge yet .
in a televised speech on sunday , the president proclaimed his innocence .
" i must ask everyone , could a-bian be this kind of crooked fellow ? " he said , referring to himself by his nickname .
mr chen can not be prosecuted while in office as he is protected by presidential immunity , but his wife and three ex-aides were charged with the misuse of state funds .
he has lost the people 's trust and respect ma ying-jeou opposition nationalist party taiwanese give their reaction in his speech , mr chen promised to resign if his wife was convicted , but he again refuted the prosecutors ' claims on friday that he and his family embezzled 14.8m taiwan dollars -lrb- us $ 450,000 -rrb- .
the address failed to calm investors .
the island 's stock market fell 1.7 % when trading began on monday .
third attempt the main opposition kuomintang party will formally propose the recall motion in parliament on friday , according to spokesman tsai chin-lung .
" we sincerely urge our colleagues from the ruling party and other groups to support our move , " he said .
if it passes , the recall motion will trigger a national referendum on whether to get rid of the president .
but the opposition parties , which have a small majority in parliament , will need at least 14 ruling party members to back the motion in order for it to succeed .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims .
charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen .
again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity testing times the last two attempts - in june and october - failed as all mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- colleagues stood by him .
analysts say the big question now is whether the prosecutors ' conclusions last friday will cause some dpp lawmakers to lose faith in their leader and vote in favour of the recall motion .
already some ruling party members are asking mr chen to take a look at his position .
" i suggest the president take time off and concentrate on the trial until a verdict is announced , " said one lawmaker , cheng yun-peng .
dpp chairman yu shyi-kun told the associated press that the party would meet on wednesday to discuss the current situation .
' unacceptable ' in his long-awaited tv address on sunday , mr chen told supporters that the charges against him were " unacceptable " .
protesters have taken to the streets to call for his resignation " the indictment is nothing but a death sentence to politicians , " he said .
mr chen said he " decided to face the prosecutors ' questioning and investigation because i had nothing to hide " , and that he was " willing to resign if the judge convicts me of corruption " .
but he said he had no motive for corruption , and pointed out that he had voluntarily halved his own presidential salary - funds which were far larger than the amount of money allegedly embezzled .
the tv address is being regarded as one of the most important speeches in president chen 's political career , according to the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei .
but while mr chen rebutted the allegations against him , he gave no details about the destination of unaccounted public funds , our correspondent says .

the packs will become a part of the home-buying process , with the seller having any searches done before putting a property on the market .
southampton , newcastle , northampton , bath , huddersfield and cambridge are the six test areas - sellers will not have to pay for the packs .
but it is expected that hips will become mandatory in june 2007 .
the hips for england and wales will shift the emphasis from the buyer to the seller to collate information about a property before it is sold .
the packs will include : evidence of title copies of planning , listed building or building regulations consents a local search guarantees for any work on the property an energy performance certificate .
stephen hayter , a chartered surveyor and sales director of a conveyancing firm , said : " it 's a major change .
it takes the emphasis away from the buyer and makes sure the seller puts information up front .
" many sellers and buyers do appreciate seeing information early in the process rather than too late . "
the government has set aside £ 4m to be used during the trial , to encourage sellers to take up voluntary packs .
in july , housing minister yvette cooper announced that the controversial home condition report element of the hips needed further testing and would not come into force in june 2007 .
splinta , a group opposing the introduction of hips , has questioned the objectivity and validity of the trials , despite government assurances .

" every morning i go to the seaside , i call many young fishermen and i start speaking to them , " she says .
she started her campaign after her only son drowned trying to reach the canary islands .
" he died in the sea with 81 young people who were all fishermen and all from our village . "
she lives in thiaroye , a poor suburb of 45,000 people on the outskirts of the senegalese capital , dakar , which used to be a traditional fishermen 's village .
in the past few months , thiaroye has evolved from dire anonymity to world fame , hitting newspaper headlines around the globe .
the suburb had become one of the major launch-pads for thousands of young west africans trying to reach europe in small fishing boats .
scarce fish mrs diouf says poverty resulting from the declining fish stocks is the major reason why young people are prepared to risk drowning in the atlantic ocean to reach europe .
many locals blame the scarcity of fish on overfishing by massive european trawlers - they say they can not compete in their traditional wooden vessels . "
if most of us are trying to leave this country , it 's because we have no opportunities here " malick sall " from our forefathers , all our families are fishermen .
the men used to go and fish , the women used to buy and sell their products , " says mrs diouf .
following the death of hundreds of youths from the area , the local women 's development group she heads has switched its focus to migration .
one small room in a corner of her house serves as the association headquarters .
posters and pictures of recent activities related to the campaign are hanging on the walls of the small office , equipped with one computer and two tiny desks .
the association 's lack of resources only mirrors the lack of resources for the community as a whole .
" the equipment and motors used in the fishing boats have become too old , " and the community can not afford to replace them , mrs diouf says .
" so when the ' passeurs ' -lsb- traffickers who organise the trips -rsb- came here to offer the opportunity to travel , the young people who knew the sea were tempted and they all signed up . "
although mrs diouf says the boats no longer leave thiaroye , local young people are as keen as ever to seek their fortunes in europe , despite the risks .
determined " if today , as we speak , i see a boat going , i would be among the volunteers , let alone tomorrow , " said malick sall , a young electrician in his mid-twenties .
" if most of us are trying to leave this country , it 's because we have no opportunities here , " he said , blaming the " government for not helping the youth at all " .
in the same overcrowded compound , where people and cattle live together and which also hosts a carpenter 's workshop , mbaye diop faye spends his time feeding and taking care of two rams , which he hopes to sell .
he says the rams are his only wealth and it is tough for him to survive with this activity .
though he would prefer to stay in senegal , he would n't mind leaving given the opportunity .
but this does not discourage the determined campaigners .
" when you do a campaign , you ca n't expect to achieve 100 % success , " mrs diouf says philosophically .
she prefers to point to those young men who have come to ask for support and advice and to help her run the campaign .

yayi bayam diouf runs her campaign from a room in her house " every morning i go to the seaside , i call many young fishermen and i start speaking to them , " she says .
she started her campaign after her only son drowned trying to reach the canary islands .
" he died in the sea with 81 young people who were all fishermen and all from our village . "
she lives in thiaroye , a poor suburb of 45,000 people on the outskirts of the senegalese capital , dakar , which used to be a traditional fishermen 's village .
in the past few months , thiaroye has evolved from dire anonymity to world fame , hitting newspaper headlines around the globe .
the suburb had become one of the major launch-pads for thousands of young west africans trying to reach europe in small fishing boats .
scarce fish mrs diouf says poverty resulting from the declining fish stocks is the major reason why young people are prepared to risk drowning in the atlantic ocean to reach europe .
many locals blame the scarcity of fish on overfishing by massive european trawlers - they say they can not compete in their traditional wooden vessels .

following the death of hundreds of youths from the area , the local women 's development group she heads has switched its focus to migration .
one small room in a corner of her house serves as the association headquarters .
posters and pictures of recent activities related to the campaign are hanging on the walls of the small office , equipped with one computer and two tiny desks .
the association 's lack of resources only mirrors the lack of resources for the community as a whole .
the boats are filled out of sight of the shore " the equipment and motors used in the fishing boats have become too old , " and the community can not afford to replace them , mrs diouf says .
" so when the ' passeurs ' -lsb- traffickers who organise the trips -rsb- came here to offer the opportunity to travel , the young people who knew the sea were tempted and they all signed up . "
although mrs diouf says the boats no longer leave thiaroye , local young people are as keen as ever to seek their fortunes in europe , despite the risks .

in the same overcrowded compound , where people and cattle live together and which also hosts a carpenter 's workshop , mbaye diop faye spends his time feeding and taking care of two rams , which he hopes to sell .
he says the rams are his only wealth and it is tough for him to survive with this activity .
though he would prefer to stay in senegal , he would n't mind leaving given the opportunity .
but this does not discourage the determined campaigners .

they held a meeting last month to pool ideas on how they can collectively give charlbury a sustainable environment .
now , where for years the debate has been whether the oxfordshire place is a town or a village , residents have switched to discussing saving energy .
one of the scheme 's founders , liz reason , already boasts one of the most energy efficient homes in the country - it is so efficient , local conservative mp , david cameron , gained inspiration , on a recent visit , from the house for his own home improvements .
mrs reason puts the cosiness of her home down to being draft proof - there is no letter box in her front door , all skirting boards are painstakingly sealed to the floor and not a whistle of wind can get past her entry porch .
the biggest innovation would be if you got duty-free every time you went into video conferencing mike flanagan a charlbury resident for 15 years , she says " sustainable charlbury " is about changing the way people think .
sat at her kitchen table , surrounded by energy saving light bulbs and information leaflets , she says : " there 's no limit to the amount human beings can change their behaviour , we want people to think they can make a difference . "
with her are three more of the sustainable charlbury scheme 's founders , who are planning to set up a community interest company , and secure grants for the community 's plans .
proposals include a " light bulb library " - a supply of energy saving bulbs to supply the town which has no diy store .
there are also proposals for a garden to produce fruit and veg and " bring-and-takes " to re-use belongings .
see how some of the 3,500 residents are working to make charlbury sustainable .

she has not flown since 1999 and has found alternative ways to travel .
charlbury 's primary school is next to millennium wood , the planned site for an organic garden , to supply residents and school lunches .
while sustainable charlbury has been warmly received by residents , the idea was first conceived by a nine-year-old .

a pilot scheme is being launched by the royal pharmaceutical society this week to protect patients .
it comes days after leading cancer doctors warned patients are increasingly turning to the web because drugs are unavailable on the nhs .
the rps scheme will only apply to sites registered in the uk .
patients may believe they are purchasing medicines from a registered healthcare professional , when in fact the supplier has no professional qualifications or healthcare expertise lynsey balmer , royal pharmaceutical society the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency , a watchdog which oversees the quality of medicines available in the uk , polices the internet - but can only close down british-based sites which break the law , as it has does not have jurisdiction over those based abroad .
' well-informed ' there is concern over consumers buying drugs via the internet because some products are fake and contain ingredients bearing little resemblance to the medicine named on the bottle .
taking these medicines will do no good to a patient , and may even cause harm .
in august this year , the lancet medical journal reported the case of a woman who damaged her vision with oral steroids bought online from thailand .
the 64-year-old woman had taken the drug for four years after making an incorrect self-diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome .
cancer consultant karol sikora has also warned that patients who can not get the latest drugs on the nhs are turning to the web to access what they believe they need .
he said a number of his own private patients had ordered drugs such as avastin for bowel cancer and tarceva for lung cancer from a canada-based internet site .
" these patients are well-informed and they shop around for the cheapest prices , " he added .
' public benefit ' the rps scheme can not outlaw disreputable sites , or the unwanted emails offering cut-price deals on medicines such as the anti-impotence drug viagra .
instead , it aims to help those people who want to be able to obtain reputable products , but who do not want to get them via a family doctor , perhaps because they are embarrassed about their condition .

the device could allow users to more tightly control their blood glucose levels without the need for repeated jabs to test blood and give insulin .
it could give people with diabetes more flexible lifestyles and defend them better from complications .
the computerised glucose sensor will be tested in a trial run by cambridge university scientists from january .
clever gadgetry the artificial pancreas is made up of the sensor , a computer programme that calculates how much insulin is needed to keep blood sugar in check , and an insulin pump .
the purpose of the trial , run by dr roman hovorka and backed by the juvenile diabetes research foundation , is to perfect the computer algorithm so the glucose sensor can " talk " to the insulin pump effectively and mimic the work of a normal pancreas .
dr hovorka hopes that after a series of clinical trials over the next two years the device could be used by children in their own homes .
how it works 1 - continuous glucose sensor monitors blood sugar level 2 - data transmitted for the computer programme to work out insulin dose 3 - insulin pump delivers the dose ' i want to fit in with my friends ' he said it could be four to seven years before it is available commercially .
many diabetics already use an insulin pump - a small device worn outside the body that pumps insulin into the body through a thin tube under the skin - to remove the need for a daily series of injections .
but they still have to test their blood many times each day to measure their blood glucose .
these finger prick tests only give a snap shot of blood glucose .
in comparison , continuous glucose sensors , the size of a credit card and worn on the skin , read glucose levels on a minute-by-minute basis using a small sensor that is inserted under the skin .
achieving good blood glucose control dramatically lowers the risk of serious complications such as blindness , stroke and premature death .
studies have found that even patients who aggressively manage their disease - measuring their blood glucose an average of nine times a day - spent less than 30 % of the day in normal range .
the rest of the time , their blood sugar levels were either too high or too low .
daily insulin injections and finger prick blood tests are such a tremendous physical and emotional burden jdrf chief executive karen addington diabetes ' makes me odd man out ' trials show patients using continuous glucose sensors spend 26 % more time in normal glucose range , and have statistically significant improvements in a measure of longer-term blood glucose control , called hba1c .
cambridge is one of nine international research centres testing the artificial pancreas .
jdrf chief executive karen addington said : " achieving good blood glucose control dramatically lowers the risk of serious complications , by as much as 75 % for some problems .
" once perfected and made available , the artificial pancreas will bring a huge sense of relief to children with type 1 diabetes for whom multiple daily insulin injections and finger prick blood tests are such a tremendous physical and emotional burden . "
cathy moulton of diabetes uk said the concept was a very exciting one .
" achieving good blood glucose levels is essential to the management of diabetes and preventing diabetes complications such as blindness , amputation , kidney problems and heart disease . "
in type 1 diabetes the body stops making insulin and the blood glucose level goes very high .
this type of diabetes usually appears before the age of 40 and accounts for between 5 and 15 % of all people with diabetes .
treatment to control the blood glucose level is with insulin injections and a healthy diet .

the device could allow users to more tightly control their blood glucose levels without the need for repeated jabs to test blood and give insulin .
it could give people with diabetes more flexible lifestyles and defend them better from complications .
the computerised glucose sensor will be tested in a trial run by cambridge university scientists from january .
clever gadgetry the artificial pancreas is made up of the sensor , a computer programme that calculates how much insulin is needed to keep blood sugar in check , and an insulin pump .
the purpose of the trial , run by dr roman hovorka and backed by the juvenile diabetes research foundation , is to perfect the computer algorithm so the glucose sensor can " talk " to the insulin pump effectively and mimic the work of a normal pancreas .
dr hovorka hopes that after a series of clinical trials over the next two years the device could be used by children in their own homes .
how it works 1 - continuous glucose sensor monitors blood sugar level 2 - data transmitted for the computer programme to work out insulin dose 3 - insulin pump delivers the dose ' i want to fit in with my friends ' he said it could be four to seven years before it is available commercially .
many diabetics already use an insulin pump - a small device worn outside the body that pumps insulin into the body through a thin tube under the skin - to remove the need for a daily series of injections .
but they still have to test their blood many times each day to measure their blood glucose .
these finger prick tests only give a snap shot of blood glucose .
in comparison , continuous glucose sensors , the size of a credit card and worn on the skin , read glucose levels on a minute-by-minute basis using a small sensor that is inserted under the skin .
achieving good blood glucose control dramatically lowers the risk of serious complications such as blindness , stroke and premature death .
studies have found that even patients who aggressively manage their disease - measuring their blood glucose an average of nine times a day - spent less than 30 % of the day in normal range .
the rest of the time , their blood sugar levels were either too high or too low .
daily insulin injections and finger prick blood tests are such a tremendous physical and emotional burden jdrf chief executive karen addington diabetes ' makes me odd man out ' trials show patients using continuous glucose sensors spend 26 % more time in normal glucose range , and have statistically significant improvements in a measure of longer-term blood glucose control , called hba1c .
cambridge is one of nine international research centres testing the artificial pancreas .
jdrf chief executive karen addington said : " achieving good blood glucose control dramatically lowers the risk of serious complications , by as much as 75 % for some problems .
" once perfected and made available , the artificial pancreas will bring a huge sense of relief to children with type 1 diabetes for whom multiple daily insulin injections and finger prick blood tests are such a tremendous physical and emotional burden . "
cathy moulton of diabetes uk said the concept was a very exciting one .
" achieving good blood glucose levels is essential to the management of diabetes and preventing diabetes complications such as blindness , amputation , kidney problems and heart disease . "
in type 1 diabetes the body stops making insulin and the blood glucose level goes very high .

the virus writers created a page on the german wikipedia that linked to a fake fix for a new version of an old malicious windows worm .
but instead of curing a bug , those installing the fix would be infected by a new windows virus .
the booby-trapped page on the german version of the online encyclopaedia has now been removed .
cleaning up " the very openness of websites like wikipedia - which allow anyone to edit pages - makes them terrific , but can also make them less trustworthy , " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant for sophos .
" in this case , the article in question was n't just misleading , it was downright malicious . "
the page hijacked by the virus creators was about a new variant of the windows blaster worm .
this malicious program debuted in 2003 and caught out many pc users .
included on the page was a link to a supposed patch that , once downloaded and installed , would protect against this new version .
however , anyone installing this on a windows machine would infect themselves with a virus .
the malicious hackers behind the fake article then sent out a german-language spam e-mail with a message crafted to look like it came from wikipedia .
the message directed people to the booby-trapped page and the fake fix .
by piggy-backing on the good name of wikipedia the message got past e-mail filters that would otherwise have cleaned it up .
it is not thought that many people fell victim to the booby-trapped page or downloaded the dangerous file .
" the good news is that the authorities at wikipedia quickly identified and edited the article on their site , " said mr cluley .

leeds-based northern foods was fighting an application to give the pie an exclusive european regional status , such as champagne .
it said restricting production to a zone around the town would cause economic damage .
the firm dropped its appeal after the government said manufacturers would be given five years to move production .
northern foods said the company was pleased with the outcome and said the five-year grace period would mean a " level playing field for the industry " .
the firm had already unsuccessfully challenged the application in the uk courts .
it argued that authentic melton mowbray pies had been produced far from leicestershire for more than 100 years .
' home and dry ' matthew o 'callaghan , from the melton mowbray pork pie association , said he thought the fight for protected status had nearly been won .
the association is backing an application for the exclusion zone , which would take in grantham , nottingham and northampton , that is being considered by the european commission .
" we think we 're home and dry .
" it -lrb- protected status -rrb- is important so the consumer knows they 're getting a genuine article .
" it protects regional foods and is important for jobs in and around the melton mowbray area . "
he said if the application was successful , pie makers would have to ensure the melton mowbray pork pie is made from uncured pork , to ensure the inside is grey in colour .

1 -rrb- it has been denied and denied truths cause guilt and anger by those who deny .
2 .
modern turkey feels itself a different , better , nation and culture than the one that slew the armenians .
i 've lived in turkey and admire the people there greatly .
marvin mcconoughey , corvallis , oregon usa something that happened nearly 100 years ago is being brought up in order to hinder turkey 's membership of the ec .
armenia refuses to take part in a joint commission of historians , and the archives of the ussr have not been examined .
no country has a clean slate , least of all france georgina özer , istanbul , turkey much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity david whitman , sydney australia a strong country accepts its painful past and a weak one denies it .
georgina burns , london there is no question that it was genocide .
do n't call it a " massacre " .
call it what it is .
the turkish people feel guilty because they have learned the " party line " in their education , but in their hearts they know the truth .
historical guilt exists when the nation has not acknowledged its past .
annette gurdjian , oregon , usa i believe admitting to guilt would not be the problem as such .
there is enough proof that terrible things have been done by one nation against another .
i think the problem would rather be that by admitting guilt , one admits that one has been wrong and commited acts that should not be permitted .
in the eyes of many , this could weeken the self-created identity " nation " .
so in the end it all comes down to the fact that the individuals ' fear to lose his identity influences the policy making. fatima , switzerland you 've asked for some insight into the turkish mind , and i 'm more than happy to oblige .
of course turkey has its own share of fanatics who just want an excuse to " kick people " , and they form one of the fiercest -lrb- and also one of the most unfocused and badly-led -rrb- centers of opposition to the debate of what actually happened in 1915 .
the cases opened against writers -lrb- i believe you actually had orhan pamuk 's case in mind -rrb- were all the doing of these people , and so was the short lived proposal to recognize an " algerian genocide " .
but most people in turkey simply do not believe that what took place can be classified as a genocide , and we have never seen proof to the contrary .
i 'm sure you 've done a lot of research already , but you might want to remember the number of people who could actually be sentenced for war crimes against the armenians were but a handful , even with english and american comissions ploughing the country deep for proof .
however , the most important thing causing this indignation towards france is the simple injustice of it .
in the past few years , turkey has opened the imperial ottoman archives to scholars , has allowed the free debate of what happened in 1915 , and even though with the usual ups and downs , has adopted a much more liberal approach towards the issue .
mehmet cansoy , istanbul- turkey asking why turkey finds it difficult to discuss atrocities in 1915 is a legitimate question .
but an equally legitimate question is how many ottoman muslims died at the hands of armenians and their russians allies at that time and earlier .
by all means suggest that turkey should be more rational and open about these events , but why is it that mark mardwell does not speak to the turks and kurds in eastern turkey with historic memories as the victims of massacres ?
it is an american historian justin mccarthy in his book death and exile in the ottoman empire who claims that more ottoman muslims died in tne region than armenians .
is it rational and open of mark mardell to ignore the victims and suffering on both sides ?
are the armenains rational and open when they try to label those massacres as ' genocide ' of armenians and ignore the armenenian responsibility for massacres ?
barry stocker , istanbul , turkey i believe that nationalism of the second type -lrb- the one that you called the prickly nationalism -rrb- is becoming more and more popular in the former empires -lrb- e.g. turkey or russia -rrb- .
oksana , laramie , wyoming , usa it 's not possible to apologise for every past supposed historical wrong , should the british apologise to the welsh and irish for pushing their celtic ancestors out of england or should denmark pay reparations to sweden and norway for being their imperial overlords during the union of kalmar .
we can ¿ t keep apologising for the past but we also can not ban discussion about such events .
denial of recent events is even more dangerous -lrb- as there may still be people who were alive at that time of the " genocide " or have parents who were there -rrb- .
i wasn ¿ t there in 1915 but i do know there is a vast supply of documents detailing the expulsion of armenians , yet turkey is one of the few countries which continues to deny it , to ban discussion is wrong to deny a historical wrong is even worse .
daniel , prague , czech republic i agree with most of this article. people seems to point finger at the wrong doing of other for one reason or another.brit vs french german vs american congolesevs rwandan , japan vs korea vs china and so on. sens of denial when it comes to the negative side of history and of course much publicity for what is seemsto be the proud past. believe me the past will serve as a reference to todays issue. as humans we need to focus on the paresent for a better futur. thank you muand , swansea wales in the first years of the last century italy was busy gassing ethiopia , we were busy in what was then persia .
in the same way that we dont realistically expect the french to apologise for the aftermath of the risings in 1070 , why should an apology be expected ?
it wouldnt mean anything to apologiser or apologisee .
if out of direct living memory , such events are a matter of historical record , and care should be taken to see that that record is as accurate as is possible .
simon , nottingham what is to be gained by turkey relaxing its law to allow for freedom of speech in regards to the genocide ?
everything .
it 's self-explanatory that free and open discourse among the people is one of the keystones of democracy .
what is to be gained by the turkish government admitting fault , wrong-doing , blah blah blah ?
a relative nothing .
as you so succinctly put it , it creates an environment of " blaming " ; i received a card from a friend on battle of hastings day that read " celebrating 940 years of french ruining the english language ! "
why is it such a sensitive issue for turkey ?
one can cite latent racism , obstinance , ignorance or out-right belligerence .
yet , i feel that turkey would be right to refuse to accept responsibility for the massacres since it was " so long ago " -lrb- under another regime -rrb- and who are we to call the kettle black ?
turkey , however , is wrong for enforcing draconian laws that stifle the very democratic ideals that they will be flooded with if / when it becomes a member of the european union .
jeff , athens , greece it 's wrong to blame the current turkish population for what happened during the first world war , however , it 's also wrong to deny past injustices .
acceptance of guilt is the first step towards reconciliation .
where would the world have been today had the germans continued to deny the holocaust committed by the nazis ?
humanity should have a higher place than politics .
officially recognising the armenian genocide should be one of the criteria for allowing turkey into the eu .
taniel varoujan , melbourne , australia a comment on mr. capar 's demand that turkey acknowledge that something important happened in 1915 : an increasing number of turks , such as myself , do believe that something important happened during wwi between the armenian and non-armenian inhabitants of the ottoman empire .
however , we dispute both the number of dead , based on historical evidence , and more importantly the intent to commit genocide , which is a legal requirement , again based on the only information that is available .
turks object to being convicted of a crime without being given the chance to prove their innocence , or even to give their own view on the issue .
the recent turkish position of letting the historians decide is indicative of this desire for dialogue , and yet the armenian diaspora and the nation of armenia have rejected this suggestion .
the diaspora has even tried to go one step further in france by trying to make it illegal to disagree with their narrow and admittedly biased version of events . !
eren alp , toronto , canada quite understandably , people get frustrated when their history is insulted .
after all , history classes at schools , at least in this part of the world , only tell the good things our ancestors have achieved .
but the most essential element of humanity is respect , for the opinions of people , their preferences , their beliefs .
and that seems to be lacking from present day turkey , which seems to me like a pampered kid , everyone wants to spank , but is afrain to do so because of political , economic and other interests .
i guess the lack of respect leads to human suffering , like the suffering of armenians , kurds , jews , somalis , etc etc etc marios neoptolemou , nicosia , cyprus being german i have to bear another " national guilt " .
it 's hard at times but on the whole i think it is the only way to admit the horrible things that were done .
apologies wo n't bring back the dead but on the other hand , if we germans would not apologize - what would that be ?
admitting a horrible crime like that will help us to avoid it in future .
i have to recognize the horrible deeds done in the past to learn from them .
never , never let it happen again !
was n't just a few years ago that the roman catholic church apologized officially for all the horrible crimes done in her name ?
an apology long waited for .
they admitted it .
they were guilty in the past .
that 's their chance - our chance ! - to learn and to do everything possible to prevent it in the future .
dorothea.schulz @ vanruysdael.com , netherlands i for one am a nationalist and believe that turkey should n't be apologising for past mistakes , as you say , of the ottoman empire in the same way that we should n't be apologising for the slave trade of 200 years ago .
should i be apologising to the malayans for my fathers actions during the malay peninsula actions of the late 50 's / early 60 's when he was in the navy ?
perhaps i should apologise for my grandfathers actions towards the germans during wwii ?
absolutely ridiculous but i 'm sure the debate will rage on in various forms for a long time yet .
phil bodycote , colchester , england i am an expat living in turkey for the past 9 years .
i feel that the armenian question is a debate for historians and should not be used as a weapon in the decisions of whether or not turkey should be allowed into the eu .
historically not one member of the eu can claim innocence in its past .
but we are talking about a relatively new and very proud republic that has achieved enormous change -lrb- for the better of all -rrb- in its short existence , the current government is also achieving much in modernising and perhaps westernising an astonishingly complex country .
i and many of my friends believe turkey would be better off without joining and that it would be the west that would benefit more than turkey if it does .
steve traynor , dalyan mugla turkey your comment on nationalism stikes the nail on the head .
let me take the argument one step further .
all nations have moments in their history that make them feel especially proud .
all of them have moments of shame as well .
accepting the latter as historical fact bears certain pre requisites .
democratic depth , elementary tolerance , and social openess are a few but probably do not exhaust the list .
-lrb- prickly -rrb- nationalism is the opium of the people -lrb- as well as nations -rrb- .
yannis dimarakis , athens , greece .
i agree that the question of historical guilt is a very interesting one .
but i feel the most important aspect of history is that it is debated , recorded and in cases of genocide that it is at a minimum accepted and acknowledged , in order to show respect to those who lost their lives and their families .
the other question i would ask is whether the histories of other entrants to the eu were explored and any areas of genocide highlighted before they joined the eu ?
if not , why is turkey 's history now in question ?
i have no issues with debating history , especially where attrocities against humankind have been or may have been committed , this is an essential for us to move forward and work towards creating a better future .
but it seems wrong to use such sensitive issues for political gain .
canan sadik , kent , uk the ottoman were a major power and empire that almost - just almost - was totally eclipsed within recent memory .
their contribution to world civilization was immense .
the need of the succeeding turks to portray themselves in a benign light - just punishing rebellious ethnicities of an empire - is necessary for their own sense to saving the ottomans via a self-defense plea .
as an ancient historian i can only say that such cultural delusions are common , from the assyrians onward .
and more recently , i can cite the evidence for the deliberate withholding of water and medication from boers who were concentrated into camps at a time when there was full knowledge of the risk of epidemics .
or giving smallpox blankets to american indians by the us .
and of course now , the grandchildren of the german camps now have millions of palestinians behind walls , were access to water , power and food is rationed .
are the israelis monsters ?
no , i see no difference .
no special dispensation or veniality .
i just see it as the stupidity of our specie , especially in a time when avian flu is now mutating in china as i write .
are we evil , do i believe in original sin ?
nope , i ' m one of those who believes in what i like to call , original stupidity - the very shortsighted ability of individuals and cultures to do what seems at the moment is in their own best interest .
jim sibal , nyc , ny i think this touches upon the near fanatical patriotism of the us.there 's a form of nationalism that borders on fundalmentalism which is extremely dangerous .
we now live in a world of censorship , my country right or wrong , where the lessons of the past are never explored or discussed in a rational way .
is there any other country in the world that is more hung up on national symbols and pits one 's patriotism against the other ?
we 're slowly creeping towards fascism in the us .
i 'm sorry this more a cry in the wilderness .
the turks need to atone for their sins and move on .
god knows the us needs to confront it 's past and atrocities and grow up .
robert s. cook , fresno , ca usa as a conservative southern white american male , i am familiar with routinely being accused of happenings in the past with which i had absolutely nothing to do .
slavery , sexism , jim crow laws , and the vietnam war are all somehow my fault .
of course i consider this type of labeling to be extremely unjust .
that being said , there is a necessity for speaking the truth about what happened in the past .
admitting something happened -lrb- and calling it what it was -rrb- is not automatically an admission of guilt .
and it sould be completely assinine for me to insist that anyone who calls slavery " slavery " be prosecuted because i do n't feel guilty for what happened ...
jeremy spiers , knoxville , tennessee , usa i think that it is an act of courage and self-honesty if a country , or representatives of that country 's leaders , etc. can admit to acts of inhumanity in the present or past , not necessarily with a lot of guilt , but with a sense of responsibility .
this is happening less and less nowadays it seems , especially in my country , where many of the citizens -lrb- see for example , writer richard flanagan of tasmania , australia , who has just published a book about what is happening in australia at the present with the gradual erosing of human rights in this country -rrb- feel that this is no longer the country we could feel relatively happy about that tried to give others a ' fair go ' etc .
nowadays , it seems very inhumane acts are sanctioned or hidden .
toni keeling , launceston australia in america we have a similar experience .
the substance of the history that i refer to here is the vietnam war , which we lost , and which still divides the us as clearly as it did 40 years ago .
the emotional scars to the nation 's psyche have not healed .
the g-word of armenians by the turks is another one of those issues .
just this year the american general who investigated the over 500 documented atrocity cases in the pentagon files went public and asked that the records be unsealed .
this whole subject still hurts america and will continue to until we get completely honest about what happened .
each of us has our own peerspective on our own historical life events .
mine happens to be that of a combat soldier who volunteered for active service .
while i am proud of the men that i served with -lrb- mostly -rrb- , i am also aware that my country 's policy was flawed from the beginning and at best poorly implemented .
john f. beirne , williamsport , pa , usa considering the large number of turks and people of turkish origin living here -lrb- particularly in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and my country -rrb- we should be working towards more integration and a greater understanding of their culture , not beating them over the head with an issue most of us -lrb- including your diarist -rrb- , clearly have no understanding of .
alexandra skwara , vienna , austria the continued denial by not only turkey , but other countries , reflects the clash between nationalism and reality .
there 's little doubt that turkey as a nation inflicted a terrible crime on armenians nearly 100 years ago .
but who are we , or any other country , to insist on their remorse and acknowledgement of that crime ?
our own history is replete with less than honourable actions , as is the history of nearly every nation in europe and beyond .
it smacks of hypocrisy on the part of all who are pressing for turkey to recognise their past deeds .
we are hobbled enough in scrutinising the current actions of leaders and countries , for example the government of israel , by past events that provoke shame and awkward silence .
i have read articles that name the turkish massacre of armenians as the ' first ' holocaust of modern civilization .
and it 's possible , given the endless and neverending use of the european holocaust to elicit shame and humiliation from those involved , that the people of turkey fear the same constant attention directed at them. alex , studying in moscow it would seem that its distasteful to subjugate and kill a lot of people within your own borders but not if they are really , really far away .
andrew molloy , chester , cheshire in my opinion we should live in the present and work for the better understanding of the nations , raising old war time stories under any name would offend somebody somewhere , let 's work out today 's challenges and wish to have a bright future of coexistence and respect .
afghans are one those nations who were extremly oppressed by colinial powers .
tamim , kabul afghanistan if someone betrays you , kills you and afterall accuses you , what would you feel except anger ...
yes , there was a bloodbath in 1915 in anatolia .
the nationalistic aspirations led to the ottoman armenians rebel against istanbul .
for this purpose they collaborated with the ottoman empire 's enemies : russia and france .
i am deeply sorry about the armenian innocent civilians , women and children .
but i think they should be sorry for turkish women and children killed by them as well !
but instead of searching the truth , they engage a misinformation campain .
ask them why are they against setting up a truth commision composed of historians !
what is wrong in establishing a commision with historians , academics who will search the truth .
the most valued step , i think , would be to set up a commision which will search for the real truth instead of wasting time with arguments which have many political agendas. haletuna kuterdem , ankara , turkey my father was a soldier in the first world war in palestine , and he and other soldiers rescued an armenian priest and his family from the turks .
the priest gave my father his only possession of any value a challis for saving their lives .
we still have this challis , my father was of the opinion that the turks were killing all christians that they could find and this priest fled his home and village to save his and his family 's lives .
this does show that there was another side to the british in what was regarded as far off lands in those days. peter deverell , england atrocities are a despicable part of the human condition .
the fact that this becomes a dispute of countries is our desperate clinging to individual national identities , when in reality we are guilty of these dark tendencies as a race , regardless of perceived borders and nationalities .
politics and nationalism are an awful , fetid excuse for turning our backs on the plight of other human beings .
therein lies our shared eternal shame .
michael ringstrøm , dane living in helsinki , finland if one can feel pride in the actions of their ancestors , one can very well learn to feel shame of guilt for their doings .
to be able to do both shows good character .
both turkey and armenia need to openly discuss what happened - let it be known widely what happened and how both nations were to blame , if that is the case .
only then can the truth come out .
for reference , see -lrb- i think -rrb- john stuart mill 's thoughts on free speech and the marketplace of ideas .
abhi k. jain , washington , dc , usa let 's not forget that this is yet another stage in the systematic campaign waged by armenians in their efforts to carve territory from and have damages paid by turkey : armenian terrorists assassinated or maimed many turkish diplomats in the ' 70s and ' 80s -lrb- taking the cue from the palestinians -rrb- in an effort to raise awareness on their claims using terrorist tactics .
now they have carried their campaign to a political platform .
they know very well that although it is true there were many deaths in those years from both sides , it was not a genocide or even an attempt at it .
it was a relocation campaign which went awfully wrong and caused deaths of scores of thousands of people of both turkish and armenian origin .
mustafa eric , toronto , canada europe should accept responsibility for kosovo and rwanda before it inteferes with turkish and armenian history and also sort out the mess theyve created in afghanistan and iraq .
us turks as a nation are muture enough to sort out our own problems within our own time .
osman celikden , milton keynes , uk my grandfather lost his wife and children during genocide in 1915 .
he was a genocide survivor and he told us the horrors of that time .
armenian genocide is an undeniable fact of history and turkey considering itself as a developed and democratic country has to admit it sooner or later .
the documnted proofs are everywhere and most of all in turkish archives .
unpunished crimes led to new ones as hitler told comfortably in 1939 , " after all , who remembers today the extermination of the armenians ? "
ani mouradian , vancouver , canada i do not think that it is a good idea to make light of historical guilt because the present-day citizens of the guilty country did not take an active part in the genocide , oppression or subjagation of entire peoples .
should you feel bad about what the britons did in kenya ?
yes !
you should .
because you are reaping the economic and social benefits of colonization every day when you wake up and go to work .
you have your job and your status because someone in your country 10 , 20 , 100 , years ago destroyed an african 's or indian 's ability to make a living independent from foreign taxes and regualations .
jennifer diaz , san francisco , california , usa history is what big powers made of .
" the armenian issue " was manipulated by france , russia and britain to serve their causes during wwi , and is still being manipulated for domestic or foreign ineterests .
that is exactly what hinders the relations between turkey and armenia from growing .
history should be investigated by historians and the result should be respected by all .
raşit , ankara being a german born in the sixties i know what it is like being held responsible for the atrocities committed by my country under the nazi-regime .
in school we were taught , not to forget our past , which i absolutely agree with .
what i do not agree with is , that this undoubted guilt is used by others to pressure germany to " be silent " when breaches of human rights -lrb- " guantanamo bay " , " palestine " , ... -rrb- are commited now .
another point : yes , i agree , turkey has to admit the atrocities on armenians , whether you call it genocide or not .
turkey has to become more democratic , but give them some good will as well .
do n't push them in a corner .
if the allied had done that after ww2 germany would probably not be the democratic state it is today .
dieter kybelksties , milton keynes , uk the turkish government needs to grow up , accept the criticism like most other western governments , and it will all go away except as an interesting academic problem .
kenzo , toronto , canada people can debate the particulars , but the pain of admitting to the dark side of humanity may be too much for some to bear .
i do beleive though it is a positive step for healing and not just in this case , but in all conflicts , inner and outer .
alex terzian , ann arbor , usa for an excellent study of the reasons behind turkish denial of the armenian genocide see turkish scholar taner akcam ¿ s new history , ¿ a shameful act : the armenian genocide and the question of turkish responsibility ¿ , reviewed in this week 's the new yorker magazine .
akcams shows that the founders of the modern turkish republic were so close to those that committed the acts that admitting to it would be admitting that modern turkey country was founded by war criminals .
richard elliott , montreal , canada i grew up listening to my grand-grandmother 's horror stories fleeing from massacres committed by armenian .
she lost two sisters , two brothers , and her father when they were immigrating from erzurum to amasya during wwi .
they lost all their belongings on the way , and arrived their final destination in starvation .
this is all because armenian militia -lrb- backed by the french and russian army -rrb- attacked women , children and elderly turks that turkish soldiers left at home when they went for war fronts in the east , west , north and south .
only a small fraction of turkish national archives are posted on the internet and i can trace the real stories of ancestors -lrb- via my surname -rrb- , and the pain and suffering they 've gone through under armenian attacks .
i am sorry for the losses that armenian immigrants on their way to syria , but otherwise we would be mourning of a wiped out turkish population in the eastern anatolia today .
and , it is not only the armenian who lost thousands of people in this war , but also the turks .
let the historians speak before using this as a political yoke on modern turkey .
koray , england in my time living in europe , the usa and parts or asia , i noted that countries that were once " great powers " have a much more " prickly " form of nationalism and i think turkey with it 's ottoman legacy fits into this camp .
the roots of the armenian question and how the turkish state has dealt with it are complicated by turkey 's need to see it 's self as living up to it 's historical greatness .
the " great power " legacy that turkey sees itself as part of prohibits any real ability for the turkey to climb down from it 's moral high ground .
put another way , i can imagine the us at some point banning certain types of behavior for " insulting american values " -lrb- think of the flag burning debate -rrb- but i have a very hard time imagining a brazilian or a canadian law that would prosecute people for offences to the national identity ... after all what identity would you insult ? ... perhaps the character of the football or ice hockey teams ?
i think it would be invaluable for mr mardell to develop this concept of " wounded national identity " tied to " great power " status and it 's role in perpetuating old conficts and creating new ones .
mike , minneapolis , usa it is about time turkey faces her atrocities towards the armenian people .
i am not saying they should be put through the same insane guilt-trip the world -lrb- especially the state of israel -rrb- and even worse german politicians put us germans still through .
but the turkish government has to admit that the genocide against the armenian people happened - even if this crime was committed by a predecessor regime - the osman empire .
tom , berlin , germany one distinction of the armenian situation from other atrocities is that it clearly was a defensive measure gone awry .
if the armenians were not attacking turks or consorting with russia in their aspirations for an independent nation , there would have been no order to evacuate them .
this is in sharp contrast to the holocaust .
western nations practice imperialism throughout their history with impunity .
turkey is not a christian nation and politically weaker than the europe or america ; therefore it poses an easy target .
condemning this moderate muslim country makes it vulnerable to exploitation by fanatical islam or western hegemony and undermines the influence of the turkish moderates who want to believe in europe ¿ s progressive agenda .
what is better for today ¿ s armenians , allowing them to relish in their revenge , or helping turkey develop into a modern country which gives them full protection and equal rights under the law ? deniz kiral , chicago , usa why does turkey does n't want to recognize the armenian genocide ?
because as part of the recognition of the armenian genocide , they will also have to compensate armenians with the return of the stolen lands , properties and money .
the sum is so large that the turkish economy may collapse and their federal buget will go bankrupt .
grigor hakobyan , phoenix , arizona -lrb- usa -rrb- oscar wilde once wrote : " patriotism is the virtue of the vicious . "
just look around the world today and you will clearly see this in effect .
you really do n't need to look too far from canada to see this happening .
this is present in other turkish laws , example " insult to turkishness " meaning your not allowed to critize your own goverment or their handeling 's of subjects / events .
this is the goverments way of dealing with their peoples critics .
repress with fear of reprisal .
no goverment was ever perfect , and no goverment will be .
to bring light to the past is the only way to understand history , and if you can not learn from 200,000 - 2,000,000 murders , why proceed to the future as history has a tendency of repeating itself , armenian or not !
" our true nationality is mankind . "
h.g. wells casey hendriks , toronto canada david whitman wrote : " much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity " this comment is a perfect example of the condescending westerner attitude that drives turks like myself into burning rage and prevents the turkish-armenian issue from being discussed in a healthy manner .
this non-ending desire to degrade , insult and undermine the turkish culture and history , and employing lies and exaggeration to do so must stop !
saying that much of turkish culture is rooted in armenian culture and that our identity fear is the reason of denial is malicious !
fyi armenians still call many of their musical instruments and dishes by their original turkish names .
now , how can anyone blame turks for swaying into " prickly " nationalism ?
ceylan yuksel , istanbul , turkey when the term genocide was coined by raphael lemkin in 1943 , the purpose was to describe what had happened to the armenians in turkey .
so please do not put the word genocide in quotation marks when you refer to the armenian genocide .
alexander nazarian , indianapolis , usa i feel that the main reason that turkey is rejecting the word ' ' genocide " is because of the fact that many sources show that similar number of turks were slayn by armenians and russians in the region during the same period .
i grew up in turkey , and when the subject came up and there were elderly people from the south eastern parts of turkey in the room ; stories were told about the dozens of relatives that were killed and torched in front of their eyes and bodies piled up and and spat on by armenian rebels used to be their friendly neihgbours not so long ago .
the incidents in the period are furthermore not excepted as genocide because most turks feel that they were stabbed in the back by the armenians who turned to russia and france as soon as they saw weakness .
afterall the two people lived side by side in harmony for hundreds of years and the ethnic armenians had even better social and economic status in the old ottoman empires eastern anatolia than the poor turkish farmers .
i am in no way denying the claim that a large number of armenians were brutally slaughtered by the ottomans but i find it peculiar that the turkish request to let historians from both countries put their documents on the table and start a debate is firmly blocked by the armenians .
rauf berent , lund , sweden turkey is proof positive of the george santayana quote : " those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
heidi , washington , dc as an american , i would compare this to slavery or the treatment of american indians .
those were certainly morally reproachable and reprehensible acts .
but i had nothing to do with them .
i like to think that if i had lived during those times that i would have been on the side of right , rallying against the oppressors .
as such , i do not feel that expecting modern day people , so far removed from the events themselves , to feel guilt about something they had no part in and no control over is ridiculous .
the world should always recognize ! the atrocities of the past in an effort to move on to a time in which similar situations do not exist , but no one should be made to feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors .
nick hussong , chicago , united states of america turkey should not be allowed to join the eu until it admits and apologizes it committed a genocide , and it pays restitution to the victims , just as germany did to the jews .
s.dastan , tehran , iran i wonder whether acknowledging the wrongs done in the past opens up the question of the way armenians are treated now .
i also wonder if it calls into question a sense of turkish identiy as a moslem nation with a secular government .
where would the armenians fit ?
elizabeth , new jersey , usa i do n't blame young generation of turks not knowing the truth about that time .
they surely have been raised with the propaganda that the massacre was all armenians make .
i myself was raised in the soviet union and up to the breack up of ussr strongly believed that it was the best system in the world .
yet , with all the abilities that internet has to offer there are thousands ways to dig in to archives and find out the truth on what really happened in 1915 .
unless the truth is revealed and accepted the dark past of that era will always hunt turkey and wo n't let move on.laura kirakosian , usa , to agree with many posters and with the author , i would also cite fierce , proud nationalism as the cause of turkey 's reluctance to admit to what happened between 1914 and 1918 .
perhaps turkey fears that admitting to this will reduce its chances of becoming an eu member .
however , i see a much larger problem with admitting a country into the eu which denies key historical facts , detrimental or not to the social and opaque construct that is its nationalistic pride .
the persecution of any people by any country should be admitted and researched , not to point a finger of blame , but to realize our mistakes , and work towards progress in the future .
maria stavropoulos , nyc , usa i think most countries have something they d like to forget.there are too many to mention. so lets not be too hard on the turks. ursula foster , gretna , va usa it 's probably best not to take the french position of somewhat needlessly antagonizing the turkish on this issue .
certainly turkey committed a campaign to drive out the armenians in the first 20 years or so of the last century .
however , there is plenty of blood to go around .
just before that same time , belgium and france were killing millions of central africans in a quest for ivory and rubber .
in some parts of the british empire and commonwealth there were bounties being paid for dead natives .
russia was committing pogroms against its jewish population .
the u.s. was crushing the last american indian resistance to the colonization of the wild west .
japan was ruthlessly expanding in china and korea .
and within countries that were the victims of western colonization , there was a tolerance of local / tribal / clan depredations against other local groups .
the truth that nobody wants to admit is that just about all the nations we live in were built and had their borders , religions and ethnicities built by conflict with other nations and peoples .
being an american i am surrounded by the ancestors of people who were forced out of their home countries and ended up coming here .
i think that the best we can do is to try to accept that a lot of bad things happened in the past and try to be more civilized in the future .
steven kraft , san jose , ca the reason why turkish people do not accept it is because they do not believe that it was genocide .
if you know that you are not a thieve , would you accept being one ?
if there is compelling evidence that it happended , why is then international community -lrb- including armenia -rrb- is so much against an international team of historians to investigate ?
after all , would you convict one party on the say so of the other only , without looking at all the evidence ?
what is that people supporting the armenian view of point so afraid of ?
yusuf kaya , glasgow / uk europe 's history as we know it is full of genocides .
france , germany , britain , serbia , etc. have all been involved in horrible crimes .
forcing turkey to admit to something which is not yet proven will make europeans feel better about themselves .
why not allow free debate and go to the ottoman , turkish , armenian and russian archives ?
turkey opened its archives , but why armenia or russia have n't ?
who is hiding what ?
pelin cos , england historical guilt , whether acknowledged or not , is pretty much an irrelevance .
what is important is whether we learn any lessons from the past and looking at world events during the past 100 years it would seem that we have not .
hitler , stalin , pol pot , rwanda , the balkans saddam hussein and today 's iraq , somalia , indonesia , palestine , the list of places where unjustified killings has been done as a result of differing ethnicity , differing views is endless .
all it proves is that man is a violent , irrational and unfeeling species .
dave , london , ontario the historical record does not clean the hands of turks , but it certainly dirties the hands of armenians sufficiently as to scare them away from taking any part in actual scholarly examination .
turkey is being blackmailed with the denialist tag to accept a denialist claim .
turks and kurds were massacred too .
will armenia recognise this ?
levent , mersin turkey the story shared about canik capur itself , once villager now tourist , suggests that the situation in turkey goes beyond questions about historical guilt .
is it any surprise that armenians want public acknowledgment of the wrongs done against them , when the moral and spiritual significance of the killings is exacerbated by modern day discrimination ?
what does turkey have to lose by granting public aknowledgment ?
as the author indicates , it seems that nationalistic pride has clouded the vision of many countries in this position .
a good dose of humility and compassion , from the leadership on down , would be refreshing .
alec smith , wheaton , il - usa well , before france goes pointing fingers at otehrs , it should apologize for colonialism , and algerian " massacres " .
that is not to say that turkey should not acknowledge whatever happened , but first we have to establish what happened and then have them acknowledge it .
i think you will probably find that atrocities were committd on both sides .
an objective look into the matter will perhaps yeild a solution that satisfies both parties and nobody should try to influence the proceedings with a stupid law like a france is trying to do. zafeerah , chicago , usa how convenient that as turkey gets closer to becoming a part of the eu , we remember what happened over a century ago .
there are far more important issues at hand , in the world today , that are far more pressing than the admittance of guilt to something that happened nearly a century ago .
get over it .
what 's happened has happened .
every group of people has been persecuted , and all those same groups have done , or will do persecuting of their own .
historical-guilt is a ridiculous notion , and a digusting one as it is conjured up for political reasons only ! !
ezra , toronto , canada once reconciliation between armenians and turks starts , we will hear more loudly about so many turkish people who actually endangered their lives to save armenians .
please understand , the wound for all armenians is too deep to let it go - will you expect someone with broken legs to run ?
true reconciliation of two peoples is necessary to heal those wounds .
and in this case that should start with honest facing of the past and not denying it .
mike arazyan , toronto , canada why is europeans so concerned with events of 100 years ago that they legislate and enforce opinion yet are unable to reach any form of consensus on rawanda / kosovo / darfur ?
living in the past ?
mike , phoenix , arizona , usa ottoman courts sentenced and punished some of ottoman citizen by reason violence against some armenians during their leave of anatolia.they were thinking revenge and this was unacceptable.ottoman courts sentenced to some turkish people.because some events was not undercontrol of ottoman state after armenian gangs massacres .
serhan , turkey could we even imagine european integration with germany if germany refused to accept its responsability in the shoa ?
why should it be different with turkey ?

1 -rrb- it has been denied and denied truths cause guilt and anger by those who deny .
2 .
modern turkey feels itself a different , better , nation and culture than the one that slew the armenians .
i 've lived in turkey and admire the people there greatly .
marvin mcconoughey , corvallis , oregon usa something that happened nearly 100 years ago is being brought up in order to hinder turkey 's membership of the ec .
armenia refuses to take part in a joint commission of historians , and the archives of the ussr have not been examined .
no country has a clean slate , least of all france georgina özer , istanbul , turkey much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity david whitman , sydney australia a strong country accepts its painful past and a weak one denies it .
georgina burns , london there is no question that it was genocide .
do n't call it a " massacre " .
call it what it is .
the turkish people feel guilty because they have learned the " party line " in their education , but in their hearts they know the truth .
historical guilt exists when the nation has not acknowledged its past .
annette gurdjian , oregon , usa i believe admitting to guilt would not be the problem as such .
there is enough proof that terrible things have been done by one nation against another .
i think the problem would rather be that by admitting guilt , one admits that one has been wrong and commited acts that should not be permitted .
in the eyes of many , this could weeken the self-created identity " nation " .
so in the end it all comes down to the fact that the individuals ' fear to lose his identity influences the policy making. fatima , switzerland you 've asked for some insight into the turkish mind , and i 'm more than happy to oblige .
of course turkey has its own share of fanatics who just want an excuse to " kick people " , and they form one of the fiercest -lrb- and also one of the most unfocused and badly-led -rrb- centers of opposition to the debate of what actually happened in 1915 .
the cases opened against writers -lrb- i believe you actually had orhan pamuk 's case in mind -rrb- were all the doing of these people , and so was the short lived proposal to recognize an " algerian genocide " .
but most people in turkey simply do not believe that what took place can be classified as a genocide , and we have never seen proof to the contrary .
i 'm sure you 've done a lot of research already , but you might want to remember the number of people who could actually be sentenced for war crimes against the armenians were but a handful , even with english and american comissions ploughing the country deep for proof .
however , the most important thing causing this indignation towards france is the simple injustice of it .
in the past few years , turkey has opened the imperial ottoman archives to scholars , has allowed the free debate of what happened in 1915 , and even though with the usual ups and downs , has adopted a much more liberal approach towards the issue .
mehmet cansoy , istanbul- turkey asking why turkey finds it difficult to discuss atrocities in 1915 is a legitimate question .
but an equally legitimate question is how many ottoman muslims died at the hands of armenians and their russians allies at that time and earlier .
by all means suggest that turkey should be more rational and open about these events , but why is it that mark mardwell does not speak to the turks and kurds in eastern turkey with historic memories as the victims of massacres ?
it is an american historian justin mccarthy in his book death and exile in the ottoman empire who claims that more ottoman muslims died in tne region than armenians .
is it rational and open of mark mardell to ignore the victims and suffering on both sides ?
are the armenains rational and open when they try to label those massacres as ' genocide ' of armenians and ignore the armenenian responsibility for massacres ?
barry stocker , istanbul , turkey i believe that nationalism of the second type -lrb- the one that you called the prickly nationalism -rrb- is becoming more and more popular in the former empires -lrb- e.g. turkey or russia -rrb- .
oksana , laramie , wyoming , usa it 's not possible to apologise for every past supposed historical wrong , should the british apologise to the welsh and irish for pushing their celtic ancestors out of england or should denmark pay reparations to sweden and norway for being their imperial overlords during the union of kalmar .
we can ¿ t keep apologising for the past but we also can not ban discussion about such events .
denial of recent events is even more dangerous -lrb- as there may still be people who were alive at that time of the " genocide " or have parents who were there -rrb- .
i wasn ¿ t there in 1915 but i do know there is a vast supply of documents detailing the expulsion of armenians , yet turkey is one of the few countries which continues to deny it , to ban discussion is wrong to deny a historical wrong is even worse .
daniel , prague , czech republic i agree with most of this article. people seems to point finger at the wrong doing of other for one reason or another.brit vs french german vs american congolesevs rwandan , japan vs korea vs china and so on. sens of denial when it comes to the negative side of history and of course much publicity for what is seemsto be the proud past. believe me the past will serve as a reference to todays issue. as humans we need to focus on the paresent for a better futur. thank you muand , swansea wales in the first years of the last century italy was busy gassing ethiopia , we were busy in what was then persia .
in the same way that we dont realistically expect the french to apologise for the aftermath of the risings in 1070 , why should an apology be expected ?
it wouldnt mean anything to apologiser or apologisee .
if out of direct living memory , such events are a matter of historical record , and care should be taken to see that that record is as accurate as is possible .
simon , nottingham what is to be gained by turkey relaxing its law to allow for freedom of speech in regards to the genocide ?
everything .
it 's self-explanatory that free and open discourse among the people is one of the keystones of democracy .
what is to be gained by the turkish government admitting fault , wrong-doing , blah blah blah ?
a relative nothing .
as you so succinctly put it , it creates an environment of " blaming " ; i received a card from a friend on battle of hastings day that read " celebrating 940 years of french ruining the english language ! "
why is it such a sensitive issue for turkey ?
one can cite latent racism , obstinance , ignorance or out-right belligerence .
yet , i feel that turkey would be right to refuse to accept responsibility for the massacres since it was " so long ago " -lrb- under another regime -rrb- and who are we to call the kettle black ?
turkey , however , is wrong for enforcing draconian laws that stifle the very democratic ideals that they will be flooded with if / when it becomes a member of the european union .
jeff , athens , greece it 's wrong to blame the current turkish population for what happened during the first world war , however , it 's also wrong to deny past injustices .
acceptance of guilt is the first step towards reconciliation .
where would the world have been today had the germans continued to deny the holocaust committed by the nazis ?
humanity should have a higher place than politics .
officially recognising the armenian genocide should be one of the criteria for allowing turkey into the eu .
taniel varoujan , melbourne , australia a comment on mr. capar 's demand that turkey acknowledge that something important happened in 1915 : an increasing number of turks , such as myself , do believe that something important happened during wwi between the armenian and non-armenian inhabitants of the ottoman empire .
however , we dispute both the number of dead , based on historical evidence , and more importantly the intent to commit genocide , which is a legal requirement , again based on the only information that is available .
turks object to being convicted of a crime without being given the chance to prove their innocence , or even to give their own view on the issue .
the recent turkish position of letting the historians decide is indicative of this desire for dialogue , and yet the armenian diaspora and the nation of armenia have rejected this suggestion .
the diaspora has even tried to go one step further in france by trying to make it illegal to disagree with their narrow and admittedly biased version of events . !
eren alp , toronto , canada quite understandably , people get frustrated when their history is insulted .
after all , history classes at schools , at least in this part of the world , only tell the good things our ancestors have achieved .
but the most essential element of humanity is respect , for the opinions of people , their preferences , their beliefs .
and that seems to be lacking from present day turkey , which seems to me like a pampered kid , everyone wants to spank , but is afrain to do so because of political , economic and other interests .
i guess the lack of respect leads to human suffering , like the suffering of armenians , kurds , jews , somalis , etc etc etc marios neoptolemou , nicosia , cyprus being german i have to bear another " national guilt " .
it 's hard at times but on the whole i think it is the only way to admit the horrible things that were done .
apologies wo n't bring back the dead but on the other hand , if we germans would not apologize - what would that be ?
admitting a horrible crime like that will help us to avoid it in future .
i have to recognize the horrible deeds done in the past to learn from them .
never , never let it happen again !
was n't just a few years ago that the roman catholic church apologized officially for all the horrible crimes done in her name ?
an apology long waited for .
they admitted it .
they were guilty in the past .
that 's their chance - our chance ! - to learn and to do everything possible to prevent it in the future .
dorothea.schulz @ vanruysdael.com , netherlands i for one am a nationalist and believe that turkey should n't be apologising for past mistakes , as you say , of the ottoman empire in the same way that we should n't be apologising for the slave trade of 200 years ago .
should i be apologising to the malayans for my fathers actions during the malay peninsula actions of the late 50 's / early 60 's when he was in the navy ?
perhaps i should apologise for my grandfathers actions towards the germans during wwii ?
absolutely ridiculous but i 'm sure the debate will rage on in various forms for a long time yet .
phil bodycote , colchester , england i am an expat living in turkey for the past 9 years .
i feel that the armenian question is a debate for historians and should not be used as a weapon in the decisions of whether or not turkey should be allowed into the eu .
historically not one member of the eu can claim innocence in its past .
but we are talking about a relatively new and very proud republic that has achieved enormous change -lrb- for the better of all -rrb- in its short existence , the current government is also achieving much in modernising and perhaps westernising an astonishingly complex country .
i and many of my friends believe turkey would be better off without joining and that it would be the west that would benefit more than turkey if it does .
steve traynor , dalyan mugla turkey your comment on nationalism stikes the nail on the head .
let me take the argument one step further .
all nations have moments in their history that make them feel especially proud .
all of them have moments of shame as well .
accepting the latter as historical fact bears certain pre requisites .
democratic depth , elementary tolerance , and social openess are a few but probably do not exhaust the list .
-lrb- prickly -rrb- nationalism is the opium of the people -lrb- as well as nations -rrb- .
yannis dimarakis , athens , greece .
i agree that the question of historical guilt is a very interesting one .
but i feel the most important aspect of history is that it is debated , recorded and in cases of genocide that it is at a minimum accepted and acknowledged , in order to show respect to those who lost their lives and their families .
the other question i would ask is whether the histories of other entrants to the eu were explored and any areas of genocide highlighted before they joined the eu ?
if not , why is turkey 's history now in question ?
i have no issues with debating history , especially where attrocities against humankind have been or may have been committed , this is an essential for us to move forward and work towards creating a better future .
but it seems wrong to use such sensitive issues for political gain .
canan sadik , kent , uk the ottoman were a major power and empire that almost - just almost - was totally eclipsed within recent memory .
their contribution to world civilization was immense .
the need of the succeeding turks to portray themselves in a benign light - just punishing rebellious ethnicities of an empire - is necessary for their own sense to saving the ottomans via a self-defense plea .
as an ancient historian i can only say that such cultural delusions are common , from the assyrians onward .
and more recently , i can cite the evidence for the deliberate withholding of water and medication from boers who were concentrated into camps at a time when there was full knowledge of the risk of epidemics .
or giving smallpox blankets to american indians by the us .
and of course now , the grandchildren of the german camps now have millions of palestinians behind walls , were access to water , power and food is rationed .
are the israelis monsters ?
no , i see no difference .
no special dispensation or veniality .
i just see it as the stupidity of our specie , especially in a time when avian flu is now mutating in china as i write .
are we evil , do i believe in original sin ?
nope , i ' m one of those who believes in what i like to call , original stupidity - the very shortsighted ability of individuals and cultures to do what seems at the moment is in their own best interest .
jim sibal , nyc , ny i think this touches upon the near fanatical patriotism of the us.there 's a form of nationalism that borders on fundalmentalism which is extremely dangerous .
we now live in a world of censorship , my country right or wrong , where the lessons of the past are never explored or discussed in a rational way .
is there any other country in the world that is more hung up on national symbols and pits one 's patriotism against the other ?
we 're slowly creeping towards fascism in the us .
i 'm sorry this more a cry in the wilderness .
the turks need to atone for their sins and move on .
god knows the us needs to confront it 's past and atrocities and grow up .
robert s. cook , fresno , ca usa as a conservative southern white american male , i am familiar with routinely being accused of happenings in the past with which i had absolutely nothing to do .
slavery , sexism , jim crow laws , and the vietnam war are all somehow my fault .
of course i consider this type of labeling to be extremely unjust .
that being said , there is a necessity for speaking the truth about what happened in the past .
admitting something happened -lrb- and calling it what it was -rrb- is not automatically an admission of guilt .
and it sould be completely assinine for me to insist that anyone who calls slavery " slavery " be prosecuted because i do n't feel guilty for what happened ...
jeremy spiers , knoxville , tennessee , usa i think that it is an act of courage and self-honesty if a country , or representatives of that country 's leaders , etc. can admit to acts of inhumanity in the present or past , not necessarily with a lot of guilt , but with a sense of responsibility .
this is happening less and less nowadays it seems , especially in my country , where many of the citizens -lrb- see for example , writer richard flanagan of tasmania , australia , who has just published a book about what is happening in australia at the present with the gradual erosing of human rights in this country -rrb- feel that this is no longer the country we could feel relatively happy about that tried to give others a ' fair go ' etc .
nowadays , it seems very inhumane acts are sanctioned or hidden .
toni keeling , launceston australia in america we have a similar experience .
the substance of the history that i refer to here is the vietnam war , which we lost , and which still divides the us as clearly as it did 40 years ago .
the emotional scars to the nation 's psyche have not healed .
the g-word of armenians by the turks is another one of those issues .
just this year the american general who investigated the over 500 documented atrocity cases in the pentagon files went public and asked that the records be unsealed .
this whole subject still hurts america and will continue to until we get completely honest about what happened .
each of us has our own peerspective on our own historical life events .
mine happens to be that of a combat soldier who volunteered for active service .
while i am proud of the men that i served with -lrb- mostly -rrb- , i am also aware that my country 's policy was flawed from the beginning and at best poorly implemented .
john f. beirne , williamsport , pa , usa considering the large number of turks and people of turkish origin living here -lrb- particularly in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and my country -rrb- we should be working towards more integration and a greater understanding of their culture , not beating them over the head with an issue most of us -lrb- including your diarist -rrb- , clearly have no understanding of .
alexandra skwara , vienna , austria the continued denial by not only turkey , but other countries , reflects the clash between nationalism and reality .
there 's little doubt that turkey as a nation inflicted a terrible crime on armenians nearly 100 years ago .
but who are we , or any other country , to insist on their remorse and acknowledgement of that crime ?
our own history is replete with less than honourable actions , as is the history of nearly every nation in europe and beyond .
it smacks of hypocrisy on the part of all who are pressing for turkey to recognise their past deeds .
we are hobbled enough in scrutinising the current actions of leaders and countries , for example the government of israel , by past events that provoke shame and awkward silence .
i have read articles that name the turkish massacre of armenians as the ' first ' holocaust of modern civilization .
and it 's possible , given the endless and neverending use of the european holocaust to elicit shame and humiliation from those involved , that the people of turkey fear the same constant attention directed at them. alex , studying in moscow it would seem that its distasteful to subjugate and kill a lot of people within your own borders but not if they are really , really far away .
andrew molloy , chester , cheshire in my opinion we should live in the present and work for the better understanding of the nations , raising old war time stories under any name would offend somebody somewhere , let 's work out today 's challenges and wish to have a bright future of coexistence and respect .
afghans are one those nations who were extremly oppressed by colinial powers .
tamim , kabul afghanistan if someone betrays you , kills you and afterall accuses you , what would you feel except anger ...
yes , there was a bloodbath in 1915 in anatolia .
the nationalistic aspirations led to the ottoman armenians rebel against istanbul .
for this purpose they collaborated with the ottoman empire 's enemies : russia and france .
i am deeply sorry about the armenian innocent civilians , women and children .
but i think they should be sorry for turkish women and children killed by them as well !
but instead of searching the truth , they engage a misinformation campain .
ask them why are they against setting up a truth commision composed of historians !
what is wrong in establishing a commision with historians , academics who will search the truth .
the most valued step , i think , would be to set up a commision which will search for the real truth instead of wasting time with arguments which have many political agendas. haletuna kuterdem , ankara , turkey my father was a soldier in the first world war in palestine , and he and other soldiers rescued an armenian priest and his family from the turks .
the priest gave my father his only possession of any value a challis for saving their lives .
we still have this challis , my father was of the opinion that the turks were killing all christians that they could find and this priest fled his home and village to save his and his family 's lives .
this does show that there was another side to the british in what was regarded as far off lands in those days. peter deverell , england atrocities are a despicable part of the human condition .
the fact that this becomes a dispute of countries is our desperate clinging to individual national identities , when in reality we are guilty of these dark tendencies as a race , regardless of perceived borders and nationalities .
politics and nationalism are an awful , fetid excuse for turning our backs on the plight of other human beings .
therein lies our shared eternal shame .
michael ringstrøm , dane living in helsinki , finland if one can feel pride in the actions of their ancestors , one can very well learn to feel shame of guilt for their doings .
to be able to do both shows good character .
both turkey and armenia need to openly discuss what happened - let it be known widely what happened and how both nations were to blame , if that is the case .
only then can the truth come out .
for reference , see -lrb- i think -rrb- john stuart mill 's thoughts on free speech and the marketplace of ideas .
abhi k. jain , washington , dc , usa let 's not forget that this is yet another stage in the systematic campaign waged by armenians in their efforts to carve territory from and have damages paid by turkey : armenian terrorists assassinated or maimed many turkish diplomats in the ' 70s and ' 80s -lrb- taking the cue from the palestinians -rrb- in an effort to raise awareness on their claims using terrorist tactics .
now they have carried their campaign to a political platform .
they know very well that although it is true there were many deaths in those years from both sides , it was not a genocide or even an attempt at it .
it was a relocation campaign which went awfully wrong and caused deaths of scores of thousands of people of both turkish and armenian origin .
mustafa eric , toronto , canada europe should accept responsibility for kosovo and rwanda before it inteferes with turkish and armenian history and also sort out the mess theyve created in afghanistan and iraq .
us turks as a nation are muture enough to sort out our own problems within our own time .
osman celikden , milton keynes , uk my grandfather lost his wife and children during genocide in 1915 .
he was a genocide survivor and he told us the horrors of that time .
armenian genocide is an undeniable fact of history and turkey considering itself as a developed and democratic country has to admit it sooner or later .
the documnted proofs are everywhere and most of all in turkish archives .
unpunished crimes led to new ones as hitler told comfortably in 1939 , " after all , who remembers today the extermination of the armenians ? "
ani mouradian , vancouver , canada i do not think that it is a good idea to make light of historical guilt because the present-day citizens of the guilty country did not take an active part in the genocide , oppression or subjagation of entire peoples .
should you feel bad about what the britons did in kenya ?
yes !
you should .
because you are reaping the economic and social benefits of colonization every day when you wake up and go to work .
you have your job and your status because someone in your country 10 , 20 , 100 , years ago destroyed an african 's or indian 's ability to make a living independent from foreign taxes and regualations .
jennifer diaz , san francisco , california , usa history is what big powers made of .
" the armenian issue " was manipulated by france , russia and britain to serve their causes during wwi , and is still being manipulated for domestic or foreign ineterests .
that is exactly what hinders the relations between turkey and armenia from growing .
history should be investigated by historians and the result should be respected by all .
raşit , ankara being a german born in the sixties i know what it is like being held responsible for the atrocities committed by my country under the nazi-regime .
in school we were taught , not to forget our past , which i absolutely agree with .
what i do not agree with is , that this undoubted guilt is used by others to pressure germany to " be silent " when breaches of human rights -lrb- " guantanamo bay " , " palestine " , ... -rrb- are commited now .
another point : yes , i agree , turkey has to admit the atrocities on armenians , whether you call it genocide or not .
turkey has to become more democratic , but give them some good will as well .
do n't push them in a corner .
if the allied had done that after ww2 germany would probably not be the democratic state it is today .
dieter kybelksties , milton keynes , uk the turkish government needs to grow up , accept the criticism like most other western governments , and it will all go away except as an interesting academic problem .
kenzo , toronto , canada people can debate the particulars , but the pain of admitting to the dark side of humanity may be too much for some to bear .
i do beleive though it is a positive step for healing and not just in this case , but in all conflicts , inner and outer .
alex terzian , ann arbor , usa for an excellent study of the reasons behind turkish denial of the armenian genocide see turkish scholar taner akcam ¿ s new history , ¿ a shameful act : the armenian genocide and the question of turkish responsibility ¿ , reviewed in this week 's the new yorker magazine .
akcams shows that the founders of the modern turkish republic were so close to those that committed the acts that admitting to it would be admitting that modern turkey country was founded by war criminals .
richard elliott , montreal , canada i grew up listening to my grand-grandmother 's horror stories fleeing from massacres committed by armenian .
she lost two sisters , two brothers , and her father when they were immigrating from erzurum to amasya during wwi .
they lost all their belongings on the way , and arrived their final destination in starvation .
this is all because armenian militia -lrb- backed by the french and russian army -rrb- attacked women , children and elderly turks that turkish soldiers left at home when they went for war fronts in the east , west , north and south .
only a small fraction of turkish national archives are posted on the internet and i can trace the real stories of ancestors -lrb- via my surname -rrb- , and the pain and suffering they 've gone through under armenian attacks .
i am sorry for the losses that armenian immigrants on their way to syria , but otherwise we would be mourning of a wiped out turkish population in the eastern anatolia today .
and , it is not only the armenian who lost thousands of people in this war , but also the turks .
let the historians speak before using this as a political yoke on modern turkey .
koray , england in my time living in europe , the usa and parts or asia , i noted that countries that were once " great powers " have a much more " prickly " form of nationalism and i think turkey with it 's ottoman legacy fits into this camp .
the roots of the armenian question and how the turkish state has dealt with it are complicated by turkey 's need to see it 's self as living up to it 's historical greatness .
the " great power " legacy that turkey sees itself as part of prohibits any real ability for the turkey to climb down from it 's moral high ground .
put another way , i can imagine the us at some point banning certain types of behavior for " insulting american values " -lrb- think of the flag burning debate -rrb- but i have a very hard time imagining a brazilian or a canadian law that would prosecute people for offences to the national identity ... after all what identity would you insult ? ... perhaps the character of the football or ice hockey teams ?
i think it would be invaluable for mr mardell to develop this concept of " wounded national identity " tied to " great power " status and it 's role in perpetuating old conficts and creating new ones .
mike , minneapolis , usa it is about time turkey faces her atrocities towards the armenian people .
i am not saying they should be put through the same insane guilt-trip the world -lrb- especially the state of israel -rrb- and even worse german politicians put us germans still through .
but the turkish government has to admit that the genocide against the armenian people happened - even if this crime was committed by a predecessor regime - the osman empire .
tom , berlin , germany one distinction of the armenian situation from other atrocities is that it clearly was a defensive measure gone awry .
if the armenians were not attacking turks or consorting with russia in their aspirations for an independent nation , there would have been no order to evacuate them .
this is in sharp contrast to the holocaust .
western nations practice imperialism throughout their history with impunity .
turkey is not a christian nation and politically weaker than the europe or america ; therefore it poses an easy target .
condemning this moderate muslim country makes it vulnerable to exploitation by fanatical islam or western hegemony and undermines the influence of the turkish moderates who want to believe in europe ¿ s progressive agenda .
what is better for today ¿ s armenians , allowing them to relish in their revenge , or helping turkey develop into a modern country which gives them full protection and equal rights under the law ? deniz kiral , chicago , usa why does turkey does n't want to recognize the armenian genocide ?
because as part of the recognition of the armenian genocide , they will also have to compensate armenians with the return of the stolen lands , properties and money .
the sum is so large that the turkish economy may collapse and their federal buget will go bankrupt .
grigor hakobyan , phoenix , arizona -lrb- usa -rrb- oscar wilde once wrote : " patriotism is the virtue of the vicious . "
just look around the world today and you will clearly see this in effect .
you really do n't need to look too far from canada to see this happening .
this is present in other turkish laws , example " insult to turkishness " meaning your not allowed to critize your own goverment or their handeling 's of subjects / events .
this is the goverments way of dealing with their peoples critics .
repress with fear of reprisal .
no goverment was ever perfect , and no goverment will be .
to bring light to the past is the only way to understand history , and if you can not learn from 200,000 - 2,000,000 murders , why proceed to the future as history has a tendency of repeating itself , armenian or not !
" our true nationality is mankind . "
h.g. wells casey hendriks , toronto canada david whitman wrote : " much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity " this comment is a perfect example of the condescending westerner attitude that drives turks like myself into burning rage and prevents the turkish-armenian issue from being discussed in a healthy manner .
this non-ending desire to degrade , insult and undermine the turkish culture and history , and employing lies and exaggeration to do so must stop !
saying that much of turkish culture is rooted in armenian culture and that our identity fear is the reason of denial is malicious !
fyi armenians still call many of their musical instruments and dishes by their original turkish names .
now , how can anyone blame turks for swaying into " prickly " nationalism ?
ceylan yuksel , istanbul , turkey when the term genocide was coined by raphael lemkin in 1943 , the purpose was to describe what had happened to the armenians in turkey .
so please do not put the word genocide in quotation marks when you refer to the armenian genocide .
alexander nazarian , indianapolis , usa i feel that the main reason that turkey is rejecting the word ' ' genocide " is because of the fact that many sources show that similar number of turks were slayn by armenians and russians in the region during the same period .
i grew up in turkey , and when the subject came up and there were elderly people from the south eastern parts of turkey in the room ; stories were told about the dozens of relatives that were killed and torched in front of their eyes and bodies piled up and and spat on by armenian rebels used to be their friendly neihgbours not so long ago .
the incidents in the period are furthermore not excepted as genocide because most turks feel that they were stabbed in the back by the armenians who turned to russia and france as soon as they saw weakness .
afterall the two people lived side by side in harmony for hundreds of years and the ethnic armenians had even better social and economic status in the old ottoman empires eastern anatolia than the poor turkish farmers .
i am in no way denying the claim that a large number of armenians were brutally slaughtered by the ottomans but i find it peculiar that the turkish request to let historians from both countries put their documents on the table and start a debate is firmly blocked by the armenians .
rauf berent , lund , sweden turkey is proof positive of the george santayana quote : " those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
heidi , washington , dc as an american , i would compare this to slavery or the treatment of american indians .
those were certainly morally reproachable and reprehensible acts .
but i had nothing to do with them .
i like to think that if i had lived during those times that i would have been on the side of right , rallying against the oppressors .
as such , i do not feel that expecting modern day people , so far removed from the events themselves , to feel guilt about something they had no part in and no control over is ridiculous .
the world should always recognize ! the atrocities of the past in an effort to move on to a time in which similar situations do not exist , but no one should be made to feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors .
nick hussong , chicago , united states of america turkey should not be allowed to join the eu until it admits and apologizes it committed a genocide , and it pays restitution to the victims , just as germany did to the jews .
s.dastan , tehran , iran i wonder whether acknowledging the wrongs done in the past opens up the question of the way armenians are treated now .
i also wonder if it calls into question a sense of turkish identiy as a moslem nation with a secular government .
where would the armenians fit ?
elizabeth , new jersey , usa i do n't blame young generation of turks not knowing the truth about that time .
they surely have been raised with the propaganda that the massacre was all armenians make .
i myself was raised in the soviet union and up to the breack up of ussr strongly believed that it was the best system in the world .
yet , with all the abilities that internet has to offer there are thousands ways to dig in to archives and find out the truth on what really happened in 1915 .
unless the truth is revealed and accepted the dark past of that era will always hunt turkey and wo n't let move on.laura kirakosian , usa , to agree with many posters and with the author , i would also cite fierce , proud nationalism as the cause of turkey 's reluctance to admit to what happened between 1914 and 1918 .
perhaps turkey fears that admitting to this will reduce its chances of becoming an eu member .
however , i see a much larger problem with admitting a country into the eu which denies key historical facts , detrimental or not to the social and opaque construct that is its nationalistic pride .
the persecution of any people by any country should be admitted and researched , not to point a finger of blame , but to realize our mistakes , and work towards progress in the future .
maria stavropoulos , nyc , usa i think most countries have something they d like to forget.there are too many to mention. so lets not be too hard on the turks. ursula foster , gretna , va usa it 's probably best not to take the french position of somewhat needlessly antagonizing the turkish on this issue .
certainly turkey committed a campaign to drive out the armenians in the first 20 years or so of the last century .
however , there is plenty of blood to go around .
just before that same time , belgium and france were killing millions of central africans in a quest for ivory and rubber .
in some parts of the british empire and commonwealth there were bounties being paid for dead natives .
russia was committing pogroms against its jewish population .
the u.s. was crushing the last american indian resistance to the colonization of the wild west .
japan was ruthlessly expanding in china and korea .
and within countries that were the victims of western colonization , there was a tolerance of local / tribal / clan depredations against other local groups .
the truth that nobody wants to admit is that just about all the nations we live in were built and had their borders , religions and ethnicities built by conflict with other nations and peoples .
being an american i am surrounded by the ancestors of people who were forced out of their home countries and ended up coming here .
i think that the best we can do is to try to accept that a lot of bad things happened in the past and try to be more civilized in the future .
steven kraft , san jose , ca the reason why turkish people do not accept it is because they do not believe that it was genocide .
if you know that you are not a thieve , would you accept being one ?
if there is compelling evidence that it happended , why is then international community -lrb- including armenia -rrb- is so much against an international team of historians to investigate ?
after all , would you convict one party on the say so of the other only , without looking at all the evidence ?
what is that people supporting the armenian view of point so afraid of ?
yusuf kaya , glasgow / uk europe 's history as we know it is full of genocides .
france , germany , britain , serbia , etc. have all been involved in horrible crimes .
forcing turkey to admit to something which is not yet proven will make europeans feel better about themselves .
why not allow free debate and go to the ottoman , turkish , armenian and russian archives ?
turkey opened its archives , but why armenia or russia have n't ?
who is hiding what ?
pelin cos , england historical guilt , whether acknowledged or not , is pretty much an irrelevance .
what is important is whether we learn any lessons from the past and looking at world events during the past 100 years it would seem that we have not .
hitler , stalin , pol pot , rwanda , the balkans saddam hussein and today 's iraq , somalia , indonesia , palestine , the list of places where unjustified killings has been done as a result of differing ethnicity , differing views is endless .
all it proves is that man is a violent , irrational and unfeeling species .
dave , london , ontario the historical record does not clean the hands of turks , but it certainly dirties the hands of armenians sufficiently as to scare them away from taking any part in actual scholarly examination .
turkey is being blackmailed with the denialist tag to accept a denialist claim .
turks and kurds were massacred too .
will armenia recognise this ?
levent , mersin turkey the story shared about canik capur itself , once villager now tourist , suggests that the situation in turkey goes beyond questions about historical guilt .
is it any surprise that armenians want public acknowledgment of the wrongs done against them , when the moral and spiritual significance of the killings is exacerbated by modern day discrimination ?
what does turkey have to lose by granting public aknowledgment ?
as the author indicates , it seems that nationalistic pride has clouded the vision of many countries in this position .
a good dose of humility and compassion , from the leadership on down , would be refreshing .
alec smith , wheaton , il - usa well , before france goes pointing fingers at otehrs , it should apologize for colonialism , and algerian " massacres " .
that is not to say that turkey should not acknowledge whatever happened , but first we have to establish what happened and then have them acknowledge it .
i think you will probably find that atrocities were committd on both sides .
an objective look into the matter will perhaps yeild a solution that satisfies both parties and nobody should try to influence the proceedings with a stupid law like a france is trying to do. zafeerah , chicago , usa how convenient that as turkey gets closer to becoming a part of the eu , we remember what happened over a century ago .
there are far more important issues at hand , in the world today , that are far more pressing than the admittance of guilt to something that happened nearly a century ago .
get over it .
what 's happened has happened .
every group of people has been persecuted , and all those same groups have done , or will do persecuting of their own .
historical-guilt is a ridiculous notion , and a digusting one as it is conjured up for political reasons only ! !
ezra , toronto , canada once reconciliation between armenians and turks starts , we will hear more loudly about so many turkish people who actually endangered their lives to save armenians .
please understand , the wound for all armenians is too deep to let it go - will you expect someone with broken legs to run ?
true reconciliation of two peoples is necessary to heal those wounds .
and in this case that should start with honest facing of the past and not denying it .
mike arazyan , toronto , canada why is europeans so concerned with events of 100 years ago that they legislate and enforce opinion yet are unable to reach any form of consensus on rawanda / kosovo / darfur ?
living in the past ?
mike , phoenix , arizona , usa ottoman courts sentenced and punished some of ottoman citizen by reason violence against some armenians during their leave of anatolia.they were thinking revenge and this was unacceptable.ottoman courts sentenced to some turkish people.because some events was not undercontrol of ottoman state after armenian gangs massacres .
serhan , turkey could we even imagine european integration with germany if germany refused to accept its responsability in the shoa ?
why should it be different with turkey ?

1 -rrb- it has been denied and denied truths cause guilt and anger by those who deny .
2 .
modern turkey feels itself a different , better , nation and culture than the one that slew the armenians .
i 've lived in turkey and admire the people there greatly .
marvin mcconoughey , corvallis , oregon usa something that happened nearly 100 years ago is being brought up in order to hinder turkey 's membership of the ec .
armenia refuses to take part in a joint commission of historians , and the archives of the ussr have not been examined .
no country has a clean slate , least of all france georgina özer , istanbul , turkey much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity david whitman , sydney australia a strong country accepts its painful past and a weak one denies it .
georgina burns , london there is no question that it was genocide .
do n't call it a " massacre " .
call it what it is .
the turkish people feel guilty because they have learned the " party line " in their education , but in their hearts they know the truth .
historical guilt exists when the nation has not acknowledged its past .
annette gurdjian , oregon , usa i believe admitting to guilt would not be the problem as such .
there is enough proof that terrible things have been done by one nation against another .
i think the problem would rather be that by admitting guilt , one admits that one has been wrong and commited acts that should not be permitted .
in the eyes of many , this could weeken the self-created identity " nation " .
so in the end it all comes down to the fact that the individuals ' fear to lose his identity influences the policy making. fatima , switzerland you 've asked for some insight into the turkish mind , and i 'm more than happy to oblige .
of course turkey has its own share of fanatics who just want an excuse to " kick people " , and they form one of the fiercest -lrb- and also one of the most unfocused and badly-led -rrb- centers of opposition to the debate of what actually happened in 1915 .
the cases opened against writers -lrb- i believe you actually had orhan pamuk 's case in mind -rrb- were all the doing of these people , and so was the short lived proposal to recognize an " algerian genocide " .
but most people in turkey simply do not believe that what took place can be classified as a genocide , and we have never seen proof to the contrary .
i 'm sure you 've done a lot of research already , but you might want to remember the number of people who could actually be sentenced for war crimes against the armenians were but a handful , even with english and american comissions ploughing the country deep for proof .
however , the most important thing causing this indignation towards france is the simple injustice of it .
in the past few years , turkey has opened the imperial ottoman archives to scholars , has allowed the free debate of what happened in 1915 , and even though with the usual ups and downs , has adopted a much more liberal approach towards the issue .
mehmet cansoy , istanbul- turkey asking why turkey finds it difficult to discuss atrocities in 1915 is a legitimate question .
but an equally legitimate question is how many ottoman muslims died at the hands of armenians and their russians allies at that time and earlier .
by all means suggest that turkey should be more rational and open about these events , but why is it that mark mardwell does not speak to the turks and kurds in eastern turkey with historic memories as the victims of massacres ?
it is an american historian justin mccarthy in his book death and exile in the ottoman empire who claims that more ottoman muslims died in tne region than armenians .
is it rational and open of mark mardell to ignore the victims and suffering on both sides ?
are the armenains rational and open when they try to label those massacres as ' genocide ' of armenians and ignore the armenenian responsibility for massacres ?
barry stocker , istanbul , turkey i believe that nationalism of the second type -lrb- the one that you called the prickly nationalism -rrb- is becoming more and more popular in the former empires -lrb- e.g. turkey or russia -rrb- .
oksana , laramie , wyoming , usa it 's not possible to apologise for every past supposed historical wrong , should the british apologise to the welsh and irish for pushing their celtic ancestors out of england or should denmark pay reparations to sweden and norway for being their imperial overlords during the union of kalmar .
we can ¿ t keep apologising for the past but we also can not ban discussion about such events .
denial of recent events is even more dangerous -lrb- as there may still be people who were alive at that time of the " genocide " or have parents who were there -rrb- .
i wasn ¿ t there in 1915 but i do know there is a vast supply of documents detailing the expulsion of armenians , yet turkey is one of the few countries which continues to deny it , to ban discussion is wrong to deny a historical wrong is even worse .
daniel , prague , czech republic i agree with most of this article. people seems to point finger at the wrong doing of other for one reason or another.brit vs french german vs american congolesevs rwandan , japan vs korea vs china and so on. sens of denial when it comes to the negative side of history and of course much publicity for what is seemsto be the proud past. believe me the past will serve as a reference to todays issue. as humans we need to focus on the paresent for a better futur. thank you muand , swansea wales in the first years of the last century italy was busy gassing ethiopia , we were busy in what was then persia .
in the same way that we dont realistically expect the french to apologise for the aftermath of the risings in 1070 , why should an apology be expected ?
it wouldnt mean anything to apologiser or apologisee .
if out of direct living memory , such events are a matter of historical record , and care should be taken to see that that record is as accurate as is possible .
simon , nottingham what is to be gained by turkey relaxing its law to allow for freedom of speech in regards to the genocide ?
everything .
it 's self-explanatory that free and open discourse among the people is one of the keystones of democracy .
what is to be gained by the turkish government admitting fault , wrong-doing , blah blah blah ?
a relative nothing .
as you so succinctly put it , it creates an environment of " blaming " ; i received a card from a friend on battle of hastings day that read " celebrating 940 years of french ruining the english language ! "
why is it such a sensitive issue for turkey ?
one can cite latent racism , obstinance , ignorance or out-right belligerence .
yet , i feel that turkey would be right to refuse to accept responsibility for the massacres since it was " so long ago " -lrb- under another regime -rrb- and who are we to call the kettle black ?
turkey , however , is wrong for enforcing draconian laws that stifle the very democratic ideals that they will be flooded with if / when it becomes a member of the european union .
jeff , athens , greece it 's wrong to blame the current turkish population for what happened during the first world war , however , it 's also wrong to deny past injustices .
acceptance of guilt is the first step towards reconciliation .
where would the world have been today had the germans continued to deny the holocaust committed by the nazis ?
humanity should have a higher place than politics .
officially recognising the armenian genocide should be one of the criteria for allowing turkey into the eu .
taniel varoujan , melbourne , australia a comment on mr. capar 's demand that turkey acknowledge that something important happened in 1915 : an increasing number of turks , such as myself , do believe that something important happened during wwi between the armenian and non-armenian inhabitants of the ottoman empire .
however , we dispute both the number of dead , based on historical evidence , and more importantly the intent to commit genocide , which is a legal requirement , again based on the only information that is available .
turks object to being convicted of a crime without being given the chance to prove their innocence , or even to give their own view on the issue .
the recent turkish position of letting the historians decide is indicative of this desire for dialogue , and yet the armenian diaspora and the nation of armenia have rejected this suggestion .
the diaspora has even tried to go one step further in france by trying to make it illegal to disagree with their narrow and admittedly biased version of events . !
eren alp , toronto , canada quite understandably , people get frustrated when their history is insulted .
after all , history classes at schools , at least in this part of the world , only tell the good things our ancestors have achieved .
but the most essential element of humanity is respect , for the opinions of people , their preferences , their beliefs .
and that seems to be lacking from present day turkey , which seems to me like a pampered kid , everyone wants to spank , but is afrain to do so because of political , economic and other interests .
i guess the lack of respect leads to human suffering , like the suffering of armenians , kurds , jews , somalis , etc etc etc marios neoptolemou , nicosia , cyprus being german i have to bear another " national guilt " .
it 's hard at times but on the whole i think it is the only way to admit the horrible things that were done .
apologies wo n't bring back the dead but on the other hand , if we germans would not apologize - what would that be ?
admitting a horrible crime like that will help us to avoid it in future .
i have to recognize the horrible deeds done in the past to learn from them .
never , never let it happen again !
was n't just a few years ago that the roman catholic church apologized officially for all the horrible crimes done in her name ?
an apology long waited for .
they admitted it .
they were guilty in the past .
that 's their chance - our chance ! - to learn and to do everything possible to prevent it in the future .
dorothea.schulz @ vanruysdael.com , netherlands i for one am a nationalist and believe that turkey should n't be apologising for past mistakes , as you say , of the ottoman empire in the same way that we should n't be apologising for the slave trade of 200 years ago .
should i be apologising to the malayans for my fathers actions during the malay peninsula actions of the late 50 's / early 60 's when he was in the navy ?
perhaps i should apologise for my grandfathers actions towards the germans during wwii ?
absolutely ridiculous but i 'm sure the debate will rage on in various forms for a long time yet .
phil bodycote , colchester , england i am an expat living in turkey for the past 9 years .
i feel that the armenian question is a debate for historians and should not be used as a weapon in the decisions of whether or not turkey should be allowed into the eu .
historically not one member of the eu can claim innocence in its past .
but we are talking about a relatively new and very proud republic that has achieved enormous change -lrb- for the better of all -rrb- in its short existence , the current government is also achieving much in modernising and perhaps westernising an astonishingly complex country .
i and many of my friends believe turkey would be better off without joining and that it would be the west that would benefit more than turkey if it does .
steve traynor , dalyan mugla turkey your comment on nationalism stikes the nail on the head .
let me take the argument one step further .
all nations have moments in their history that make them feel especially proud .
all of them have moments of shame as well .
accepting the latter as historical fact bears certain pre requisites .
democratic depth , elementary tolerance , and social openess are a few but probably do not exhaust the list .
-lrb- prickly -rrb- nationalism is the opium of the people -lrb- as well as nations -rrb- .
yannis dimarakis , athens , greece .
i agree that the question of historical guilt is a very interesting one .
but i feel the most important aspect of history is that it is debated , recorded and in cases of genocide that it is at a minimum accepted and acknowledged , in order to show respect to those who lost their lives and their families .
the other question i would ask is whether the histories of other entrants to the eu were explored and any areas of genocide highlighted before they joined the eu ?
if not , why is turkey 's history now in question ?
i have no issues with debating history , especially where attrocities against humankind have been or may have been committed , this is an essential for us to move forward and work towards creating a better future .
but it seems wrong to use such sensitive issues for political gain .
canan sadik , kent , uk the ottoman were a major power and empire that almost - just almost - was totally eclipsed within recent memory .
their contribution to world civilization was immense .
the need of the succeeding turks to portray themselves in a benign light - just punishing rebellious ethnicities of an empire - is necessary for their own sense to saving the ottomans via a self-defense plea .
as an ancient historian i can only say that such cultural delusions are common , from the assyrians onward .
and more recently , i can cite the evidence for the deliberate withholding of water and medication from boers who were concentrated into camps at a time when there was full knowledge of the risk of epidemics .
or giving smallpox blankets to american indians by the us .
and of course now , the grandchildren of the german camps now have millions of palestinians behind walls , were access to water , power and food is rationed .
are the israelis monsters ?
no , i see no difference .
no special dispensation or veniality .
i just see it as the stupidity of our specie , especially in a time when avian flu is now mutating in china as i write .
are we evil , do i believe in original sin ?
nope , i ' m one of those who believes in what i like to call , original stupidity - the very shortsighted ability of individuals and cultures to do what seems at the moment is in their own best interest .
jim sibal , nyc , ny i think this touches upon the near fanatical patriotism of the us.there 's a form of nationalism that borders on fundalmentalism which is extremely dangerous .
we now live in a world of censorship , my country right or wrong , where the lessons of the past are never explored or discussed in a rational way .
is there any other country in the world that is more hung up on national symbols and pits one 's patriotism against the other ?
we 're slowly creeping towards fascism in the us .
i 'm sorry this more a cry in the wilderness .
the turks need to atone for their sins and move on .
god knows the us needs to confront it 's past and atrocities and grow up .
robert s. cook , fresno , ca usa as a conservative southern white american male , i am familiar with routinely being accused of happenings in the past with which i had absolutely nothing to do .
slavery , sexism , jim crow laws , and the vietnam war are all somehow my fault .
of course i consider this type of labeling to be extremely unjust .
that being said , there is a necessity for speaking the truth about what happened in the past .
admitting something happened -lrb- and calling it what it was -rrb- is not automatically an admission of guilt .
and it sould be completely assinine for me to insist that anyone who calls slavery " slavery " be prosecuted because i do n't feel guilty for what happened ...
jeremy spiers , knoxville , tennessee , usa i think that it is an act of courage and self-honesty if a country , or representatives of that country 's leaders , etc. can admit to acts of inhumanity in the present or past , not necessarily with a lot of guilt , but with a sense of responsibility .
this is happening less and less nowadays it seems , especially in my country , where many of the citizens -lrb- see for example , writer richard flanagan of tasmania , australia , who has just published a book about what is happening in australia at the present with the gradual erosing of human rights in this country -rrb- feel that this is no longer the country we could feel relatively happy about that tried to give others a ' fair go ' etc .
nowadays , it seems very inhumane acts are sanctioned or hidden .
toni keeling , launceston australia in america we have a similar experience .
the substance of the history that i refer to here is the vietnam war , which we lost , and which still divides the us as clearly as it did 40 years ago .
the emotional scars to the nation 's psyche have not healed .
the g-word of armenians by the turks is another one of those issues .
just this year the american general who investigated the over 500 documented atrocity cases in the pentagon files went public and asked that the records be unsealed .
this whole subject still hurts america and will continue to until we get completely honest about what happened .
each of us has our own peerspective on our own historical life events .
mine happens to be that of a combat soldier who volunteered for active service .
while i am proud of the men that i served with -lrb- mostly -rrb- , i am also aware that my country 's policy was flawed from the beginning and at best poorly implemented .
john f. beirne , williamsport , pa , usa considering the large number of turks and people of turkish origin living here -lrb- particularly in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and my country -rrb- we should be working towards more integration and a greater understanding of their culture , not beating them over the head with an issue most of us -lrb- including your diarist -rrb- , clearly have no understanding of .
alexandra skwara , vienna , austria the continued denial by not only turkey , but other countries , reflects the clash between nationalism and reality .
there 's little doubt that turkey as a nation inflicted a terrible crime on armenians nearly 100 years ago .
but who are we , or any other country , to insist on their remorse and acknowledgement of that crime ?
our own history is replete with less than honourable actions , as is the history of nearly every nation in europe and beyond .
it smacks of hypocrisy on the part of all who are pressing for turkey to recognise their past deeds .
we are hobbled enough in scrutinising the current actions of leaders and countries , for example the government of israel , by past events that provoke shame and awkward silence .
i have read articles that name the turkish massacre of armenians as the ' first ' holocaust of modern civilization .
and it 's possible , given the endless and neverending use of the european holocaust to elicit shame and humiliation from those involved , that the people of turkey fear the same constant attention directed at them. alex , studying in moscow it would seem that its distasteful to subjugate and kill a lot of people within your own borders but not if they are really , really far away .
andrew molloy , chester , cheshire in my opinion we should live in the present and work for the better understanding of the nations , raising old war time stories under any name would offend somebody somewhere , let 's work out today 's challenges and wish to have a bright future of coexistence and respect .
afghans are one those nations who were extremly oppressed by colinial powers .
tamim , kabul afghanistan if someone betrays you , kills you and afterall accuses you , what would you feel except anger ...
yes , there was a bloodbath in 1915 in anatolia .
the nationalistic aspirations led to the ottoman armenians rebel against istanbul .
for this purpose they collaborated with the ottoman empire 's enemies : russia and france .
i am deeply sorry about the armenian innocent civilians , women and children .
but i think they should be sorry for turkish women and children killed by them as well !
but instead of searching the truth , they engage a misinformation campain .
ask them why are they against setting up a truth commision composed of historians !
what is wrong in establishing a commision with historians , academics who will search the truth .
the most valued step , i think , would be to set up a commision which will search for the real truth instead of wasting time with arguments which have many political agendas. haletuna kuterdem , ankara , turkey my father was a soldier in the first world war in palestine , and he and other soldiers rescued an armenian priest and his family from the turks .
the priest gave my father his only possession of any value a challis for saving their lives .
we still have this challis , my father was of the opinion that the turks were killing all christians that they could find and this priest fled his home and village to save his and his family 's lives .
this does show that there was another side to the british in what was regarded as far off lands in those days. peter deverell , england atrocities are a despicable part of the human condition .
the fact that this becomes a dispute of countries is our desperate clinging to individual national identities , when in reality we are guilty of these dark tendencies as a race , regardless of perceived borders and nationalities .
politics and nationalism are an awful , fetid excuse for turning our backs on the plight of other human beings .
therein lies our shared eternal shame .
michael ringstrøm , dane living in helsinki , finland if one can feel pride in the actions of their ancestors , one can very well learn to feel shame of guilt for their doings .
to be able to do both shows good character .
both turkey and armenia need to openly discuss what happened - let it be known widely what happened and how both nations were to blame , if that is the case .
only then can the truth come out .
for reference , see -lrb- i think -rrb- john stuart mill 's thoughts on free speech and the marketplace of ideas .
abhi k. jain , washington , dc , usa let 's not forget that this is yet another stage in the systematic campaign waged by armenians in their efforts to carve territory from and have damages paid by turkey : armenian terrorists assassinated or maimed many turkish diplomats in the ' 70s and ' 80s -lrb- taking the cue from the palestinians -rrb- in an effort to raise awareness on their claims using terrorist tactics .
now they have carried their campaign to a political platform .
they know very well that although it is true there were many deaths in those years from both sides , it was not a genocide or even an attempt at it .
it was a relocation campaign which went awfully wrong and caused deaths of scores of thousands of people of both turkish and armenian origin .
mustafa eric , toronto , canada europe should accept responsibility for kosovo and rwanda before it inteferes with turkish and armenian history and also sort out the mess theyve created in afghanistan and iraq .
us turks as a nation are muture enough to sort out our own problems within our own time .
osman celikden , milton keynes , uk my grandfather lost his wife and children during genocide in 1915 .
he was a genocide survivor and he told us the horrors of that time .
armenian genocide is an undeniable fact of history and turkey considering itself as a developed and democratic country has to admit it sooner or later .
the documnted proofs are everywhere and most of all in turkish archives .
unpunished crimes led to new ones as hitler told comfortably in 1939 , " after all , who remembers today the extermination of the armenians ? "
ani mouradian , vancouver , canada i do not think that it is a good idea to make light of historical guilt because the present-day citizens of the guilty country did not take an active part in the genocide , oppression or subjagation of entire peoples .
should you feel bad about what the britons did in kenya ?
yes !
you should .
because you are reaping the economic and social benefits of colonization every day when you wake up and go to work .
you have your job and your status because someone in your country 10 , 20 , 100 , years ago destroyed an african 's or indian 's ability to make a living independent from foreign taxes and regualations .
jennifer diaz , san francisco , california , usa history is what big powers made of .
" the armenian issue " was manipulated by france , russia and britain to serve their causes during wwi , and is still being manipulated for domestic or foreign ineterests .
that is exactly what hinders the relations between turkey and armenia from growing .
history should be investigated by historians and the result should be respected by all .
raşit , ankara being a german born in the sixties i know what it is like being held responsible for the atrocities committed by my country under the nazi-regime .
in school we were taught , not to forget our past , which i absolutely agree with .
what i do not agree with is , that this undoubted guilt is used by others to pressure germany to " be silent " when breaches of human rights -lrb- " guantanamo bay " , " palestine " , ... -rrb- are commited now .
another point : yes , i agree , turkey has to admit the atrocities on armenians , whether you call it genocide or not .
turkey has to become more democratic , but give them some good will as well .
do n't push them in a corner .
if the allied had done that after ww2 germany would probably not be the democratic state it is today .
dieter kybelksties , milton keynes , uk the turkish government needs to grow up , accept the criticism like most other western governments , and it will all go away except as an interesting academic problem .
kenzo , toronto , canada people can debate the particulars , but the pain of admitting to the dark side of humanity may be too much for some to bear .
i do beleive though it is a positive step for healing and not just in this case , but in all conflicts , inner and outer .
alex terzian , ann arbor , usa for an excellent study of the reasons behind turkish denial of the armenian genocide see turkish scholar taner akcam ¿ s new history , ¿ a shameful act : the armenian genocide and the question of turkish responsibility ¿ , reviewed in this week 's the new yorker magazine .
akcams shows that the founders of the modern turkish republic were so close to those that committed the acts that admitting to it would be admitting that modern turkey country was founded by war criminals .
richard elliott , montreal , canada i grew up listening to my grand-grandmother 's horror stories fleeing from massacres committed by armenian .
she lost two sisters , two brothers , and her father when they were immigrating from erzurum to amasya during wwi .
they lost all their belongings on the way , and arrived their final destination in starvation .
this is all because armenian militia -lrb- backed by the french and russian army -rrb- attacked women , children and elderly turks that turkish soldiers left at home when they went for war fronts in the east , west , north and south .
only a small fraction of turkish national archives are posted on the internet and i can trace the real stories of ancestors -lrb- via my surname -rrb- , and the pain and suffering they 've gone through under armenian attacks .
i am sorry for the losses that armenian immigrants on their way to syria , but otherwise we would be mourning of a wiped out turkish population in the eastern anatolia today .
and , it is not only the armenian who lost thousands of people in this war , but also the turks .
let the historians speak before using this as a political yoke on modern turkey .
koray , england in my time living in europe , the usa and parts or asia , i noted that countries that were once " great powers " have a much more " prickly " form of nationalism and i think turkey with it 's ottoman legacy fits into this camp .
the roots of the armenian question and how the turkish state has dealt with it are complicated by turkey 's need to see it 's self as living up to it 's historical greatness .
the " great power " legacy that turkey sees itself as part of prohibits any real ability for the turkey to climb down from it 's moral high ground .
put another way , i can imagine the us at some point banning certain types of behavior for " insulting american values " -lrb- think of the flag burning debate -rrb- but i have a very hard time imagining a brazilian or a canadian law that would prosecute people for offences to the national identity ... after all what identity would you insult ? ... perhaps the character of the football or ice hockey teams ?
i think it would be invaluable for mr mardell to develop this concept of " wounded national identity " tied to " great power " status and it 's role in perpetuating old conficts and creating new ones .
mike , minneapolis , usa it is about time turkey faces her atrocities towards the armenian people .
i am not saying they should be put through the same insane guilt-trip the world -lrb- especially the state of israel -rrb- and even worse german politicians put us germans still through .
but the turkish government has to admit that the genocide against the armenian people happened - even if this crime was committed by a predecessor regime - the osman empire .
tom , berlin , germany one distinction of the armenian situation from other atrocities is that it clearly was a defensive measure gone awry .
if the armenians were not attacking turks or consorting with russia in their aspirations for an independent nation , there would have been no order to evacuate them .
this is in sharp contrast to the holocaust .
western nations practice imperialism throughout their history with impunity .
turkey is not a christian nation and politically weaker than the europe or america ; therefore it poses an easy target .
condemning this moderate muslim country makes it vulnerable to exploitation by fanatical islam or western hegemony and undermines the influence of the turkish moderates who want to believe in europe ¿ s progressive agenda .
what is better for today ¿ s armenians , allowing them to relish in their revenge , or helping turkey develop into a modern country which gives them full protection and equal rights under the law ? deniz kiral , chicago , usa why does turkey does n't want to recognize the armenian genocide ?
because as part of the recognition of the armenian genocide , they will also have to compensate armenians with the return of the stolen lands , properties and money .
the sum is so large that the turkish economy may collapse and their federal buget will go bankrupt .
grigor hakobyan , phoenix , arizona -lrb- usa -rrb- oscar wilde once wrote : " patriotism is the virtue of the vicious . "
just look around the world today and you will clearly see this in effect .
you really do n't need to look too far from canada to see this happening .
this is present in other turkish laws , example " insult to turkishness " meaning your not allowed to critize your own goverment or their handeling 's of subjects / events .
this is the goverments way of dealing with their peoples critics .
repress with fear of reprisal .
no goverment was ever perfect , and no goverment will be .
to bring light to the past is the only way to understand history , and if you can not learn from 200,000 - 2,000,000 murders , why proceed to the future as history has a tendency of repeating itself , armenian or not !
" our true nationality is mankind . "
h.g. wells casey hendriks , toronto canada david whitman wrote : " much of turkish music , architecture , cuisine and art have armenian roots .
if the turks admit to the armenian genocide , they fear to lose a large part of what they believe is turkish identity " this comment is a perfect example of the condescending westerner attitude that drives turks like myself into burning rage and prevents the turkish-armenian issue from being discussed in a healthy manner .
this non-ending desire to degrade , insult and undermine the turkish culture and history , and employing lies and exaggeration to do so must stop !
saying that much of turkish culture is rooted in armenian culture and that our identity fear is the reason of denial is malicious !
fyi armenians still call many of their musical instruments and dishes by their original turkish names .
now , how can anyone blame turks for swaying into " prickly " nationalism ?
ceylan yuksel , istanbul , turkey when the term genocide was coined by raphael lemkin in 1943 , the purpose was to describe what had happened to the armenians in turkey .
so please do not put the word genocide in quotation marks when you refer to the armenian genocide .
alexander nazarian , indianapolis , usa i feel that the main reason that turkey is rejecting the word ' ' genocide " is because of the fact that many sources show that similar number of turks were slayn by armenians and russians in the region during the same period .
i grew up in turkey , and when the subject came up and there were elderly people from the south eastern parts of turkey in the room ; stories were told about the dozens of relatives that were killed and torched in front of their eyes and bodies piled up and and spat on by armenian rebels used to be their friendly neihgbours not so long ago .
the incidents in the period are furthermore not excepted as genocide because most turks feel that they were stabbed in the back by the armenians who turned to russia and france as soon as they saw weakness .
afterall the two people lived side by side in harmony for hundreds of years and the ethnic armenians had even better social and economic status in the old ottoman empires eastern anatolia than the poor turkish farmers .
i am in no way denying the claim that a large number of armenians were brutally slaughtered by the ottomans but i find it peculiar that the turkish request to let historians from both countries put their documents on the table and start a debate is firmly blocked by the armenians .
rauf berent , lund , sweden turkey is proof positive of the george santayana quote : " those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
heidi , washington , dc as an american , i would compare this to slavery or the treatment of american indians .
those were certainly morally reproachable and reprehensible acts .
but i had nothing to do with them .
i like to think that if i had lived during those times that i would have been on the side of right , rallying against the oppressors .
as such , i do not feel that expecting modern day people , so far removed from the events themselves , to feel guilt about something they had no part in and no control over is ridiculous .
the world should always recognize ! the atrocities of the past in an effort to move on to a time in which similar situations do not exist , but no one should be made to feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors .
nick hussong , chicago , united states of america turkey should not be allowed to join the eu until it admits and apologizes it committed a genocide , and it pays restitution to the victims , just as germany did to the jews .
s.dastan , tehran , iran i wonder whether acknowledging the wrongs done in the past opens up the question of the way armenians are treated now .
i also wonder if it calls into question a sense of turkish identiy as a moslem nation with a secular government .
where would the armenians fit ?
elizabeth , new jersey , usa i do n't blame young generation of turks not knowing the truth about that time .
they surely have been raised with the propaganda that the massacre was all armenians make .
i myself was raised in the soviet union and up to the breack up of ussr strongly believed that it was the best system in the world .
yet , with all the abilities that internet has to offer there are thousands ways to dig in to archives and find out the truth on what really happened in 1915 .
unless the truth is revealed and accepted the dark past of that era will always hunt turkey and wo n't let move on.laura kirakosian , usa , to agree with many posters and with the author , i would also cite fierce , proud nationalism as the cause of turkey 's reluctance to admit to what happened between 1914 and 1918 .
perhaps turkey fears that admitting to this will reduce its chances of becoming an eu member .
however , i see a much larger problem with admitting a country into the eu which denies key historical facts , detrimental or not to the social and opaque construct that is its nationalistic pride .
the persecution of any people by any country should be admitted and researched , not to point a finger of blame , but to realize our mistakes , and work towards progress in the future .
maria stavropoulos , nyc , usa i think most countries have something they d like to forget.there are too many to mention. so lets not be too hard on the turks. ursula foster , gretna , va usa it 's probably best not to take the french position of somewhat needlessly antagonizing the turkish on this issue .
certainly turkey committed a campaign to drive out the armenians in the first 20 years or so of the last century .
however , there is plenty of blood to go around .
just before that same time , belgium and france were killing millions of central africans in a quest for ivory and rubber .
in some parts of the british empire and commonwealth there were bounties being paid for dead natives .
russia was committing pogroms against its jewish population .
the u.s. was crushing the last american indian resistance to the colonization of the wild west .
japan was ruthlessly expanding in china and korea .
and within countries that were the victims of western colonization , there was a tolerance of local / tribal / clan depredations against other local groups .
the truth that nobody wants to admit is that just about all the nations we live in were built and had their borders , religions and ethnicities built by conflict with other nations and peoples .
being an american i am surrounded by the ancestors of people who were forced out of their home countries and ended up coming here .
i think that the best we can do is to try to accept that a lot of bad things happened in the past and try to be more civilized in the future .
steven kraft , san jose , ca the reason why turkish people do not accept it is because they do not believe that it was genocide .
if you know that you are not a thieve , would you accept being one ?
if there is compelling evidence that it happended , why is then international community -lrb- including armenia -rrb- is so much against an international team of historians to investigate ?
after all , would you convict one party on the say so of the other only , without looking at all the evidence ?
what is that people supporting the armenian view of point so afraid of ?
yusuf kaya , glasgow / uk europe 's history as we know it is full of genocides .
france , germany , britain , serbia , etc. have all been involved in horrible crimes .
forcing turkey to admit to something which is not yet proven will make europeans feel better about themselves .
why not allow free debate and go to the ottoman , turkish , armenian and russian archives ?
turkey opened its archives , but why armenia or russia have n't ?
who is hiding what ?
pelin cos , england historical guilt , whether acknowledged or not , is pretty much an irrelevance .
what is important is whether we learn any lessons from the past and looking at world events during the past 100 years it would seem that we have not .
hitler , stalin , pol pot , rwanda , the balkans saddam hussein and today 's iraq , somalia , indonesia , palestine , the list of places where unjustified killings has been done as a result of differing ethnicity , differing views is endless .
all it proves is that man is a violent , irrational and unfeeling species .
dave , london , ontario the historical record does not clean the hands of turks , but it certainly dirties the hands of armenians sufficiently as to scare them away from taking any part in actual scholarly examination .
turkey is being blackmailed with the denialist tag to accept a denialist claim .
turks and kurds were massacred too .
will armenia recognise this ?
levent , mersin turkey the story shared about canik capur itself , once villager now tourist , suggests that the situation in turkey goes beyond questions about historical guilt .
is it any surprise that armenians want public acknowledgment of the wrongs done against them , when the moral and spiritual significance of the killings is exacerbated by modern day discrimination ?
what does turkey have to lose by granting public aknowledgment ?
as the author indicates , it seems that nationalistic pride has clouded the vision of many countries in this position .
a good dose of humility and compassion , from the leadership on down , would be refreshing .
alec smith , wheaton , il - usa well , before france goes pointing fingers at otehrs , it should apologize for colonialism , and algerian " massacres " .
that is not to say that turkey should not acknowledge whatever happened , but first we have to establish what happened and then have them acknowledge it .
i think you will probably find that atrocities were committd on both sides .
an objective look into the matter will perhaps yeild a solution that satisfies both parties and nobody should try to influence the proceedings with a stupid law like a france is trying to do. zafeerah , chicago , usa how convenient that as turkey gets closer to becoming a part of the eu , we remember what happened over a century ago .
there are far more important issues at hand , in the world today , that are far more pressing than the admittance of guilt to something that happened nearly a century ago .
get over it .
what 's happened has happened .
every group of people has been persecuted , and all those same groups have done , or will do persecuting of their own .
historical-guilt is a ridiculous notion , and a digusting one as it is conjured up for political reasons only ! !
ezra , toronto , canada once reconciliation between armenians and turks starts , we will hear more loudly about so many turkish people who actually endangered their lives to save armenians .
please understand , the wound for all armenians is too deep to let it go - will you expect someone with broken legs to run ?
true reconciliation of two peoples is necessary to heal those wounds .
and in this case that should start with honest facing of the past and not denying it .
mike arazyan , toronto , canada why is europeans so concerned with events of 100 years ago that they legislate and enforce opinion yet are unable to reach any form of consensus on rawanda / kosovo / darfur ?
living in the past ?
mike , phoenix , arizona , usa ottoman courts sentenced and punished some of ottoman citizen by reason violence against some armenians during their leave of anatolia.they were thinking revenge and this was unacceptable.ottoman courts sentenced to some turkish people.because some events was not undercontrol of ottoman state after armenian gangs massacres .
serhan , turkey could we even imagine european integration with germany if germany refused to accept its responsability in the shoa ?
why should it be different with turkey ?
