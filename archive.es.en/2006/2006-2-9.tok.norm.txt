program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany -pipe- 09.02.2006 mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoons may be disrespectful , but they are likely protected in germany germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said . " it must clearly and unequivocally distance itself from a subject and not be a one-to-one sensationalist approach , " he stated , but declined to say which case applied to the mohammed caricatures . kyle james and kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world click here for dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon crisis .
" the west has made many mistakes " theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds .

" i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .
" there 's a lot of frustration , so the situation could easily escalate .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .
" there 's a lot of frustration , so the situation could easily escalate .

last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .

9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .

in fact , do n't imitate or make insulting reference to the war either , a german police official has warned english fans planning to attend the soccer world cup in this summer . " england fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " thursday 's sun tabloid , britain 's biggest-selling daily newspaper , quoted gerhard hauptmannl , the nuremberg police chief , as saying .
england plays trinidad and tobago in nuremberg in a first-round world cup match on june 15 .
the city is particularly sensitive to any reference to world war ii , having been the scene of some notorious nazi party rallies in the 1930s .
after the end of world war ii , the german city staged the war crimes trials of several senior nazis including rudolf hess , at one time hitler 's deputy , and hermann goering , the head of the luftwaffe , the german air force .
the cit 's gleaming world cup stadium also stands in the shadow of the parade ground used for hitler 's notorious nazi rallies in the 1930s .
the deputy head of the police in nuremberg , walter ernstberger , says nazi taunts are not funny and will not be tolerated . " england football fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " ernstberger said .
" this simply is a criminal act in germany .
we will offer the warmest welcome to true football fans .
but anyone glorifying extremism here risks arrest .
i think the british are intelligent enough not to insult a nation , but enjoy this huge football event as friends among friends . " nuremberg 's police are beefing up cctv surveillance with a 1.5 million euro space-age computerized control centre .
it has a bank of high-definition flat screen monitors linked to cameras that can zoom in on a single face .
close-up pictures can then be transmitted to snatch squads who will grab ringleaders in seconds .
but one problem ca n't be solved : the british tendency for binge-drinking .
walter ernstberger tries to remain optimistic . " if they celebrate in peace the pubs will stay open as usual .
it really depends on the fans ’ behavior .
alcohol related aggression can always happen .
but i don ’ t think we need any measures of precautions just because they are british . " but just in case a new cell block has been built at nuremberg 's police hq , with space for nearly 300 prisoners .
even the stadium has its own lock-up block ready for hooligans and drunks . no tolerance for intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the matches and leave the baiting at home , say german police england 's football support has long contained a strongly xenophobic element as evidenced by chants at games against germany of " i 'd rather be a paki -lrb- pakistani -rrb- than a kraut -lrb- german -rrb- " and " two world wars and one world cup , " a reference to germany 's defeats in world war i and ii and england 's victory over the then west germany in the 1966 world cup final at london 's wembley stadium .
however , hauptmannl warned that officers would be on the alert for a variety of offenses .
" we are cooperating with british police to look for any provocative behavior in the city which might lead to violence .
" racist abuse of black people by england fans will also be taken very seriously ...
my officers will have the power to remove offensive fans from the situation .
they can then be held for up to two weeks without charge or charged under a fast-track system and fined or jailed the next day .
either way , we have the power to deal with troublemakers and we will not hesistate to use it . "
fawlty premise references to german behavior in world war ii have been a staple of british humor for over 60 years and probably reached their comedic peak during an episode of the 1970s bbc program " fawlty towers . "
" the germans , " centered around the attempts of basil fawlty , a hen-pecked proprietor of an english seaside hotel played by john cleese , who co-wrote the program , to deal with a group of german guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleese wrote much of the script and played basil fawlty the running joke was that fawlty , having repeatedly warned his staff " do n't mention the war ! " , flagrantly failed to heed his own advice to the pained embarrassment of his german guests .
at one point fawlty can even be seen parading around the hotel foyer performing an exaggerated nazi military goose-step .
such is the enduring impact of " the germans , " regularly repeated since it was first broadcast in 1975 , on the british public consciousness the sun illustrated its front-page story with a still from the show of cleese goose-stepping alongside the headline " do n't mention the walk .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .

a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .

just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin . from roxy music to franz ferdinand , bands have always liked to wear their learning on their leather-clad sleeves , while forming a band at school is a teenage rite of passage .
usually , though , it 's more of a way of getting out of latin homework than an opportunity to practice declensions - but 14 years ago , ista was formed by seven students at a high-school in wilhelmshaven for precisely that reason . germany 's only latin hip hop band launched its career with a recondite rendition of " die da , " the 1992 hit by germany 's best-loved hip hoppers , " die fantastischen vier " , and recently enjoyed something of a comeback . " over the years we 've sold around 2,500 cds , " member lars janssen told british daily the telegraph .
" between 10 and 20 are bought per month from our internet site , and recently that 's doubled .
people have found us over the internet and we have sold cds to people in the us and all across europe . " not a dead la n guage after all their sudden success reflects what appears to be a nationwide latin revival .
and according to the members of the band ista , that 's because latin " grooves . " they 're not the only ones to have noticed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 739 , 000 children did latin at school last year 2005 saw a 9 percent rise in the number of students studying the classics , and the federal statistics office reveals that interest in taking latin at school is rising steadily every year . " people believe the subject provides knowledge with outstanding relevance that is immune to passing fads , " said hartmut loos of the german philologists ' association . meanwhile , radio bremen 's regular news broadcasts in latin have been attracting a growing fan base since they first aired four years ago . eruditio n is cool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 50 cent being able to read ovid in the original is all well and good , but knowing latin has some far more exciting applications .
ista frontman clemens liedtke , now 30 , insists its rhythms lend themselves perfectly to rap , and judging by ista 's new-found popularity , he must have a point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

the northern german team was forced to settle for a goalless draw against stuttgart . bremen looked set to close the gap on german leader bayern on wednesday after the southern rival only managed a 0-0 draw against hertha berlin on tuesday .
but bremen missed out on the chance to reduce the gap after failing to pull ahead in the match against stuttgart . the team 's striker , paraguayan nelson valdez , wasted a handful of goalscoring opportunities while the absence of injured top scorer miroslav klose was deeply felt .
bremen tied 0-0 against stuttgart . bremen coach thomas schaaf acknowledged his team 's weak playing .
" we could have won the game , " he told reporters , " but we did n't make use of even the clearest chances . " as a result , bremen stayed in second position , just ahead of third-placed hamburg , which slipped to a surprise 2-1 defeat at hanover .
bayern kept its eight-point lead over the pack . bayern lead with 51 points from 20 matches and look set to take a 20th bundesliga title , while bremen have 43 points and hamburg 41 . hamburg falls behind hamburg 's third-place ranking comes after it fell behind following a loss to hanover .
a 48th-minute goal from hanover 's dariusz zuraw kicked off the unexpected win and was followed up by a goal by iranian international vahid hashemian in the 72nd minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's ricardo sousa , left , and hamburg 's david jarolim compete for the ball hamburg struggled to keep up and a header by sergej barbarez in the 81st minute brought the northerners up a point .
but the visitors were unable to find a last-minute equalizer . to round off a poor night for hamburg , recently signed veteran brazilian striker ailton was carried off the pitch after suffering a broken jaw and is expected to be out for several weeks . hamburg 's rush for the bundesliga title looks over now . coach thomas doss admitted hamburg was sitting in the doldrums .
" it really annoys me that we seem to make teams like nuremberg and hanover stronger , even though they are well within our capabilities , " he told reporters . league overview bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's thomas broich , left , challenges for the ball with schalke 's fabian ernst meanwhile schalke 04 stayed locked in fourth spot after a goalless stalemate away to borussia monchengladbach . bayer leverkusen notched up a 4-0 victory over wolfsburg , giving their former coach a miserable return play .
" i had imagined my return rather differently , " klaus augenthaler said .
" i could see today that we have a lot of work ahead of us . " leverkusen have a chance of a uefa cup spot as one of seven clubs in mid-table range . fc nuremberg failed to move away from the relegation zone as they lost 1-0 at home to eintracht frankfurt , with greek striker ioannis amanatidis driving home the winner just before half-time . nuremberg is now fourth from bottom , a precarious four points ahead of last-ranked kaiserslautern . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin pins down mighty bayern bayern munich moved nine points clear at the top of the bundesliga on tuesday but were frustrated by hertha berlin who held them to a goalless draw in the german capital .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said . " it must clearly and unequivocally distance itself from a subject and not be a one-to-one sensationalist approach , " he stated , but declined to say which case applied to the mohammed caricatures . kyle james and kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world click here for dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon crisis .

just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin . from roxy music to franz ferdinand , bands have always liked to wear their learning on their leather-clad sleeves , while forming a band at school is a teenage rite of passage .
usually , though , it 's more of a way of getting out of latin homework than an opportunity to practice declensions - but 14 years ago , ista was formed by seven students at a high-school in wilhelmshaven for precisely that reason . germany 's only latin hip hop band launched its career with a recondite rendition of " die da , " the 1992 hit by germany 's best-loved hip hoppers , " die fantastischen vier " , and recently enjoyed something of a comeback . " over the years we 've sold around 2,500 cds , " member lars janssen told british daily the telegraph .
" between 10 and 20 are bought per month from our internet site , and recently that 's doubled .
people have found us over the internet and we have sold cds to people in the us and all across europe . " not a dead la n guage after all their sudden success reflects what appears to be a nationwide latin revival .
and according to the members of the band ista , that 's because latin " grooves . " they 're not the only ones to have noticed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 739 , 000 children did latin at school last year 2005 saw a 9 percent rise in the number of students studying the classics , and the federal statistics office reveals that interest in taking latin at school is rising steadily every year . " people believe the subject provides knowledge with outstanding relevance that is immune to passing fads , " said hartmut loos of the german philologists ' association . meanwhile , radio bremen 's regular news broadcasts in latin have been attracting a growing fan base since they first aired four years ago . eruditio n is cool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 50 cent being able to read ovid in the original is all well and good , but knowing latin has some far more exciting applications .
ista frontman clemens liedtke , now 30 , insists its rhythms lend themselves perfectly to rap , and judging by ista 's new-found popularity , he must have a point .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

in fact , do n't imitate or make insulting reference to the war either , a german police official has warned english fans planning to attend the soccer world cup in this summer . " england fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " thursday 's sun tabloid , britain 's biggest-selling daily newspaper , quoted gerhard hauptmannl , the nuremberg police chief , as saying .
england plays trinidad and tobago in nuremberg in a first-round world cup match on june 15 .
the city is particularly sensitive to any reference to world war ii , having been the scene of some notorious nazi party rallies in the 1930s .
after the end of world war ii , the german city staged the war crimes trials of several senior nazis including rudolf hess , at one time hitler 's deputy , and hermann goering , the head of the luftwaffe , the german air force .
the cit 's gleaming world cup stadium also stands in the shadow of the parade ground used for hitler 's notorious nazi rallies in the 1930s .
the deputy head of the police in nuremberg , walter ernstberger , says nazi taunts are not funny and will not be tolerated . " england football fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " ernstberger said .
" this simply is a criminal act in germany .
we will offer the warmest welcome to true football fans .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system .

according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .

a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .
" there 's a lot of frustration , so the situation could easily escalate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

in fact , do n't imitate or make insulting reference to the war either , a german police official has warned english fans planning to attend the soccer world cup in this summer . " england fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " thursday 's sun tabloid , britain 's biggest-selling daily newspaper , quoted gerhard hauptmannl , the nuremberg police chief , as saying .
england plays trinidad and tobago in nuremberg in a first-round world cup match on june 15 .
the city is particularly sensitive to any reference to world war ii , having been the scene of some notorious nazi party rallies in the 1930s .
after the end of world war ii , the german city staged the war crimes trials of several senior nazis including rudolf hess , at one time hitler 's deputy , and hermann goering , the head of the luftwaffe , the german air force .
the cit 's gleaming world cup stadium also stands in the shadow of the parade ground used for hitler 's notorious nazi rallies in the 1930s .
the deputy head of the police in nuremberg , walter ernstberger , says nazi taunts are not funny and will not be tolerated . " england football fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " ernstberger said .
" this simply is a criminal act in germany .
we will offer the warmest welcome to true football fans .
but anyone glorifying extremism here risks arrest .
i think the british are intelligent enough not to insult a nation , but enjoy this huge football event as friends among friends . " nuremberg 's police are beefing up cctv surveillance with a 1.5 million euro space-age computerized control centre .
it has a bank of high-definition flat screen monitors linked to cameras that can zoom in on a single face .
close-up pictures can then be transmitted to snatch squads who will grab ringleaders in seconds .
but one problem ca n't be solved : the british tendency for binge-drinking .
walter ernstberger tries to remain optimistic . " if they celebrate in peace the pubs will stay open as usual .
it really depends on the fans ’ behavior .
alcohol related aggression can always happen .
but i don ’ t think we need any measures of precautions just because they are british . " but just in case a new cell block has been built at nuremberg 's police hq , with space for nearly 300 prisoners .
even the stadium has its own lock-up block ready for hooligans and drunks . no tolerance for intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the matches and leave the baiting at home , say german police england 's football support has long contained a strongly xenophobic element as evidenced by chants at games against germany of " i 'd rather be a paki -lrb- pakistani -rrb- than a kraut -lrb- german -rrb- " and " two world wars and one world cup , " a reference to germany 's defeats in world war i and ii and england 's victory over the then west germany in the 1966 world cup final at london 's wembley stadium .
however , hauptmannl warned that officers would be on the alert for a variety of offenses .
" we are cooperating with british police to look for any provocative behavior in the city which might lead to violence .
" racist abuse of black people by england fans will also be taken very seriously ...
my officers will have the power to remove offensive fans from the situation .
they can then be held for up to two weeks without charge or charged under a fast-track system and fined or jailed the next day .
either way , we have the power to deal with troublemakers and we will not hesistate to use it . "
fawlty premise references to german behavior in world war ii have been a staple of british humor for over 60 years and probably reached their comedic peak during an episode of the 1970s bbc program " fawlty towers . "
" the germans , " centered around the attempts of basil fawlty , a hen-pecked proprietor of an english seaside hotel played by john cleese , who co-wrote the program , to deal with a group of german guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleese wrote much of the script and played basil fawlty the running joke was that fawlty , having repeatedly warned his staff " do n't mention the war ! " , flagrantly failed to heed his own advice to the pained embarrassment of his german guests .
at one point fawlty can even be seen parading around the hotel foyer performing an exaggerated nazi military goose-step .
such is the enduring impact of " the germans , " regularly repeated since it was first broadcast in 1975 , on the british public consciousness the sun illustrated its front-page story with a still from the show of cleese goose-stepping alongside the headline " do n't mention the walk .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .
" in previous olympics a similar deployment of security forces would have been unthinkable . " heightened tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian flag burns in bangladesh as part of worldwide islamic protests the times have also been getting increasingly tenser in recent days due to muslim fury over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany -pipe- 09.02.2006 mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoons may be disrespectful , but they are likely protected in germany germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said . " it must clearly and unequivocally distance itself from a subject and not be a one-to-one sensationalist approach , " he stated , but declined to say which case applied to the mohammed caricatures . kyle james and kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world click here for dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon crisis .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .

the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .

a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .

just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin . from roxy music to franz ferdinand , bands have always liked to wear their learning on their leather-clad sleeves , while forming a band at school is a teenage rite of passage .
usually , though , it 's more of a way of getting out of latin homework than an opportunity to practice declensions - but 14 years ago , ista was formed by seven students at a high-school in wilhelmshaven for precisely that reason . germany 's only latin hip hop band launched its career with a recondite rendition of " die da , " the 1992 hit by germany 's best-loved hip hoppers , " die fantastischen vier " , and recently enjoyed something of a comeback . " over the years we 've sold around 2,500 cds , " member lars janssen told british daily the telegraph .
" between 10 and 20 are bought per month from our internet site , and recently that 's doubled .
people have found us over the internet and we have sold cds to people in the us and all across europe . " not a dead la n guage after all their sudden success reflects what appears to be a nationwide latin revival .
and according to the members of the band ista , that 's because latin " grooves . " they 're not the only ones to have noticed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 739 , 000 children did latin at school last year 2005 saw a 9 percent rise in the number of students studying the classics , and the federal statistics office reveals that interest in taking latin at school is rising steadily every year . " people believe the subject provides knowledge with outstanding relevance that is immune to passing fads , " said hartmut loos of the german philologists ' association . meanwhile , radio bremen 's regular news broadcasts in latin have been attracting a growing fan base since they first aired four years ago . eruditio n is cool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 50 cent being able to read ovid in the original is all well and good , but knowing latin has some far more exciting applications .
ista frontman clemens liedtke , now 30 , insists its rhythms lend themselves perfectly to rap , and judging by ista 's new-found popularity , he must have a point .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .
" in previous olympics a similar deployment of security forces would have been unthinkable . " heightened tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian flag burns in bangladesh as part of worldwide islamic protests the times have also been getting increasingly tenser in recent days due to muslim fury over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .
if the public peace would be disturbed , or it proven that the goal of the offending material was to insult a religion or a religious community , it could be a case for the justice system . " if the caricature were , say , mohammed as a pig , then i 'm sure that it would be banned in germany , " he said . reporting or provocation ? while the verdict is still out as to whether or not the mohammed cartoons violate german law , several complaints have been filed with the german press council , which monitors ethical violations in the media .
according to managing director lutz tillmanns , individuals offended by the caricatures have a right to submit a complaint , which will then be reviewed by the press council 's board of members . tillmanns refused to say how many complaints had actually been filed against the german reprint of the cartoons , but added that passing judgment on them fell within the responsibilities of the council , which defines and maintains the standards of the press in keeping with the framework of the german constitution .
last year , the press watchdog received 750 complaints , most of which focused on purported instances of libel and slander in the press .
however , instances of discrimination and sensationalist reporting with the intent to provoke have also been recorded . in illustrating the extent to which the council was justified in reprimanding the media , tillmanns explained it was important to differentiate between reporting an issue and endorsing it for ulterior purposes .
" one has to ask if the subject matter is presented as a quote with the intent of clarifying an issue for the reader or whether it is purporting a certain position , " the lawyer said . " it must clearly and unequivocally distance itself from a subject and not be a one-to-one sensationalist approach , " he stated , but declined to say which case applied to the mohammed caricatures . kyle james and kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world click here for dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon crisis .

it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .
" in previous olympics a similar deployment of security forces would have been unthinkable . " heightened tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian flag burns in bangladesh as part of worldwide islamic protests the times have also been getting increasingly tenser in recent days due to muslim fury over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .

in fact , do n't imitate or make insulting reference to the war either , a german police official has warned english fans planning to attend the soccer world cup in this summer . " england fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " thursday 's sun tabloid , britain 's biggest-selling daily newspaper , quoted gerhard hauptmannl , the nuremberg police chief , as saying .
england plays trinidad and tobago in nuremberg in a first-round world cup match on june 15 .
the city is particularly sensitive to any reference to world war ii , having been the scene of some notorious nazi party rallies in the 1930s .
after the end of world war ii , the german city staged the war crimes trials of several senior nazis including rudolf hess , at one time hitler 's deputy , and hermann goering , the head of the luftwaffe , the german air force .
the cit 's gleaming world cup stadium also stands in the shadow of the parade ground used for hitler 's notorious nazi rallies in the 1930s .
the deputy head of the police in nuremberg , walter ernstberger , says nazi taunts are not funny and will not be tolerated . " england football fans should be aware that the nazi salute and provocative behavior like goose-stepping in public will be punished , " ernstberger said .
" this simply is a criminal act in germany .
we will offer the warmest welcome to true football fans .
but anyone glorifying extremism here risks arrest .
i think the british are intelligent enough not to insult a nation , but enjoy this huge football event as friends among friends . " nuremberg 's police are beefing up cctv surveillance with a 1.5 million euro space-age computerized control centre .
it has a bank of high-definition flat screen monitors linked to cameras that can zoom in on a single face .
close-up pictures can then be transmitted to snatch squads who will grab ringleaders in seconds .
but one problem ca n't be solved : the british tendency for binge-drinking .
walter ernstberger tries to remain optimistic . " if they celebrate in peace the pubs will stay open as usual .
it really depends on the fans ’ behavior .
alcohol related aggression can always happen .
but i don ’ t think we need any measures of precautions just because they are british . " but just in case a new cell block has been built at nuremberg 's police hq , with space for nearly 300 prisoners .
even the stadium has its own lock-up block ready for hooligans and drunks . no tolerance for intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the matches and leave the baiting at home , say german police england 's football support has long contained a strongly xenophobic element as evidenced by chants at games against germany of " i 'd rather be a paki -lrb- pakistani -rrb- than a kraut -lrb- german -rrb- " and " two world wars and one world cup , " a reference to germany 's defeats in world war i and ii and england 's victory over the then west germany in the 1966 world cup final at london 's wembley stadium .
however , hauptmannl warned that officers would be on the alert for a variety of offenses .
" we are cooperating with british police to look for any provocative behavior in the city which might lead to violence .
" racist abuse of black people by england fans will also be taken very seriously ...
my officers will have the power to remove offensive fans from the situation .
they can then be held for up to two weeks without charge or charged under a fast-track system and fined or jailed the next day .
either way , we have the power to deal with troublemakers and we will not hesistate to use it . "
fawlty premise references to german behavior in world war ii have been a staple of british humor for over 60 years and probably reached their comedic peak during an episode of the 1970s bbc program " fawlty towers . "
" the germans , " centered around the attempts of basil fawlty , a hen-pecked proprietor of an english seaside hotel played by john cleese , who co-wrote the program , to deal with a group of german guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleese wrote much of the script and played basil fawlty the running joke was that fawlty , having repeatedly warned his staff " do n't mention the war ! " , flagrantly failed to heed his own advice to the pained embarrassment of his german guests .
at one point fawlty can even be seen parading around the hotel foyer performing an exaggerated nazi military goose-step .
such is the enduring impact of " the germans , " regularly repeated since it was first broadcast in 1975 , on the british public consciousness the sun illustrated its front-page story with a still from the show of cleese goose-stepping alongside the headline " do n't mention the walk .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .
" there 's a lot of frustration , so the situation could easily escalate . " dennis stute -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de four killed in afghanistan in cartoon row , calm urged the un , eu and the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have urged restraint and dialogue as worldwide muslim fury against danish cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed claimed four lives in afghanistan .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .
" in previous olympics a similar deployment of security forces would have been unthinkable . " heightened tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian flag burns in bangladesh as part of worldwide islamic protests the times have also been getting increasingly tenser in recent days due to muslim fury over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

and they wo n't be taking any chances . " of course there will be snipers , " turin 's security chief goffredo sottile told reporters this week after meeting with fbi director robert müller .
" there 'll be an entire system .
all the special police forces will be activated .
the most important aspect is prevention , control of the territory and the security of the athletes and visiting dignitaries . " the times in which we live are the way they are , which is why there 's huge attention , " he added .
" in previous olympics a similar deployment of security forces would have been unthinkable . " heightened tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an italian flag burns in bangladesh as part of worldwide islamic protests the times have also been getting increasingly tenser in recent days due to muslim fury over cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed .
the situation and increased threat of disruption has caused security organizers to rethink some their measures . " particular attention has been paid to the possible fallout in italy from the wave of protests taking place in the world and to the latest preventative measures taken in these last days , " italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement after chairing and emergency session of security officials on monday . pisanu added , however , that there were no signs of an actual threat to the games , but that organizers were nevertheless vigilant . italy 's premier silvio berlusconi added that his government had spared no effort to provide security . " we have worked thoroughly for security and i think that no government has ever done what we have , " he said . the anger directed at european nations over the cartoons and italy 's support of the us-led invasion of iraq has heightened concerns regarding a possible attack in turin .
italy has repeatedly been mentioned as a potential target for a militant islamist attack due to its backing of the united states . us links fuel islamist and anti-capitalist anger that support , coupled with the visit of us first lady laura bush to turin , has everyone on high alert .
the presence of the us president 's wife is also likely to attract anti-capitalist protesters to the streets of turin , an added headache to the security operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-bush campaigners have caused italy problems in the past " since the protests at the world economic summit in genoa in 2001 , italian politicians fear crowds such as these , " stefan kempiz at the konrad adenauer institute in rome told dw-world . protestors demonstrating against the multinational sponsors of the games , such as coca cola , and a high-speed rail development in the susa valley have already caused disruptions , targeting the olympic torch as it traveled around the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time nears to turn the tables on norway 162 german athletes will be going to the turin winter olympics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany -pipe- 09.02.2006 mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoons may be disrespectful , but they are likely protected in germany germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .

just when you thought that " dumbing down " had got the better of everyone , it seems that germany has rediscovered the joys of latin . from roxy music to franz ferdinand , bands have always liked to wear their learning on their leather-clad sleeves , while forming a band at school is a teenage rite of passage .
usually , though , it 's more of a way of getting out of latin homework than an opportunity to practice declensions - but 14 years ago , ista was formed by seven students at a high-school in wilhelmshaven for precisely that reason . germany 's only latin hip hop band launched its career with a recondite rendition of " die da , " the 1992 hit by germany 's best-loved hip hoppers , " die fantastischen vier " , and recently enjoyed something of a comeback . " over the years we 've sold around 2,500 cds , " member lars janssen told british daily the telegraph .
" between 10 and 20 are bought per month from our internet site , and recently that 's doubled .
people have found us over the internet and we have sold cds to people in the us and all across europe . " not a dead la n guage after all their sudden success reflects what appears to be a nationwide latin revival .
and according to the members of the band ista , that 's because latin " grooves . " they 're not the only ones to have noticed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 739 , 000 children did latin at school last year 2005 saw a 9 percent rise in the number of students studying the classics , and the federal statistics office reveals that interest in taking latin at school is rising steadily every year . " people believe the subject provides knowledge with outstanding relevance that is immune to passing fads , " said hartmut loos of the german philologists ' association . meanwhile , radio bremen 's regular news broadcasts in latin have been attracting a growing fan base since they first aired four years ago . eruditio n is cool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 50 cent being able to read ovid in the original is all well and good , but knowing latin has some far more exciting applications .
ista frontman clemens liedtke , now 30 , insists its rhythms lend themselves perfectly to rap , and judging by ista 's new-found popularity , he must have a point .

the northern german team was forced to settle for a goalless draw against stuttgart . bremen looked set to close the gap on german leader bayern on wednesday after the southern rival only managed a 0-0 draw against hertha berlin on tuesday .
but bremen missed out on the chance to reduce the gap after failing to pull ahead in the match against stuttgart . the team 's striker , paraguayan nelson valdez , wasted a handful of goalscoring opportunities while the absence of injured top scorer miroslav klose was deeply felt .
bremen tied 0-0 against stuttgart . bremen coach thomas schaaf acknowledged his team 's weak playing .
" we could have won the game , " he told reporters , " but we did n't make use of even the clearest chances . " as a result , bremen stayed in second position , just ahead of third-placed hamburg , which slipped to a surprise 2-1 defeat at hanover .
bayern kept its eight-point lead over the pack . bayern lead with 51 points from 20 matches and look set to take a 20th bundesliga title , while bremen have 43 points and hamburg 41 . hamburg falls behind hamburg 's third-place ranking comes after it fell behind following a loss to hanover .

" it really annoys me that we seem to make teams like nuremberg and hanover stronger , even though they are well within our capabilities , " he told reporters . league overview bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's thomas broich , left , challenges for the ball with schalke 's fabian ernst meanwhile schalke 04 stayed locked in fourth spot after a goalless stalemate away to borussia monchengladbach . bayer leverkusen notched up a 4-0 victory over wolfsburg , giving their former coach a miserable return play .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.02.2006 " love never goes out of fashion " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yash chopra 's film " veer zara " showed at the berlinale last year as the berlin film festival kicks off on thursday , dw-world talked to international jury member and acclaimed bollywood director and producer yash chopra about movies and love . best known for his lavish song-and-dance hindi films packed with melodrama and star-studded glamour , yash chopra is one of the most prominent directors and producers in india .
his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

how worried should they be ? everyone at nato headquarters in kabul is doing their best to stay level-headed in the face of growing hostility on their doorstep . on tuesday , police opened fire on a mob of nearly 300 people trying to storm a nato peacekeeping base housing norwegian troops in the northwestern town of maymana on tuesday , killing four people and injuring five norwegians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us military base in qalat on feb .
8 .
a day later , hundreds of protesters gathered in the town of qalat , in zabul province in the south , hurling stones at police and torching vehicles . but annie gibson-sextet , spokeswoman with the isaf in kabul , pointed out that the demonstrations were not targeted specifically at the peace-keeping forces and that similar scenes have been taking place across the globe . " the protests were not particularly against nato troops based on our performance , " she stressed .
" as isaf troops , we are accepted .
the people see us doing what our task actually is - providing security . " not calm , n ot stable and ultimately , has anything changed ?
even before this week 's incidents , the bundeswehr 's official assessment of the situation in afghanistan was " not calm and not stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr makes up the largest isaf contingent but bernhard gertz , president of the german bundeswehr association , believes the protests are significant . " this is the first time there 's been a deliberate attack on isaf troops , " he said , pointing out that it would inevitably have repercussions on the 9000-strong force , 2200 of which are german . until now , nato soldiers have met with a positive reception , but according to gertz , radical muslims have used the caricature controversy to stir up resentment in the local population . " i suspect this is not just a flash-in-the-pan , " he said , but stressed that president hamid karsai 's government would do its best to contain the troubles .
" tribal leaders also have a vested interest in de-escalating the conflict . " opium age n da michael pohly , an afghanistan expert at berlin 's free university , disagreed , adding that he believes that local warlords may even be behind the protests . " if the isaf has to scale down its activities then it will also be less effective in tackling opium production , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo bay , cuba " the protests allow tribal leaders to strengthen their position , " said citha maass from the foundation for science and politics in berlin , pointing out that religious controversies will always be inflammatory - as illustrated in may 2005 when the international media sparked protests across the muslim world by reporting cases of alleged koran desecration at the us detention facility in guantanamo bay . but maass also argued that a worsening of the security situation in afghanistan was only to be expected . " after the taliban was toppled there was an initial period of calm , " she said .
" but instability is inevitable given growing provincial rivalries as well as taliban infiltration from pakistan . " afghanistan expert pohly meanwhile said he thinks the protests are an expression of a creeping dissatisfaction . " understandably , locals are asking what the peace dividends actually are , " he said .
" there 's a lot of frustration , so the situation could easily escalate .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law . " most of europe would not dare mock the holocaust , and rightly so , " inayat bunglawala of the muslim council of britain said in an interview , adding that the continent , however , would tolerate cartoons that were insulting to islam . " some want to strike back and want to put holocaust deniers in the same category , " said wolfgang wippermann , a professor at the freie university in berlin who studies nazism and right-wing extremism . " but that is like comparing apples and oranges , " he added .
" the caricatures , whether good or bad , are a part of press freedom .
the other side is a denial of historical fact that also has political aims . " religious sensitivities vs. free speech udo branahl , a professor of media law at the university of dortmund , said that he had not seen all of the caricatures . but the one which appears to have caused the most offense - depicting mohammed with a bomb in his turban - would likely be protected by press freedom laws , he said .
that 's despite the fact that german law states that one can not capriciously trample of the religious sensitivities of parts of the population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a caricature of osama bin laden would have upset fewer people " this caricature is obviously aimed at discrediting bombers who bomb in the name of islam , " he said .
" the idea that bomb planting could be supported by the teachings of mohammed is so absurd that it would be protected by the freedom of expression law . " but he adds there are limits , here as well .

the northern german team was forced to settle for a goalless draw against stuttgart . bremen looked set to close the gap on german leader bayern on wednesday after the southern rival only managed a 0-0 draw against hertha berlin on tuesday .
but bremen missed out on the chance to reduce the gap after failing to pull ahead in the match against stuttgart . the team 's striker , paraguayan nelson valdez , wasted a handful of goalscoring opportunities while the absence of injured top scorer miroslav klose was deeply felt .
bremen tied 0-0 against stuttgart . bremen coach thomas schaaf acknowledged his team 's weak playing .
" we could have won the game , " he told reporters , " but we did n't make use of even the clearest chances . " as a result , bremen stayed in second position , just ahead of third-placed hamburg , which slipped to a surprise 2-1 defeat at hanover .
bayern kept its eight-point lead over the pack . bayern lead with 51 points from 20 matches and look set to take a 20th bundesliga title , while bremen have 43 points and hamburg 41 . hamburg falls behind hamburg 's third-place ranking comes after it fell behind following a loss to hanover .
a 48th-minute goal from hanover 's dariusz zuraw kicked off the unexpected win and was followed up by a goal by iranian international vahid hashemian in the 72nd minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's ricardo sousa , left , and hamburg 's david jarolim compete for the ball hamburg struggled to keep up and a header by sergej barbarez in the 81st minute brought the northerners up a point .

" i could see today that we have a lot of work ahead of us . " leverkusen have a chance of a uefa cup spot as one of seven clubs in mid-table range . fc nuremberg failed to move away from the relegation zone as they lost 1-0 at home to eintracht frankfurt , with greek striker ioannis amanatidis driving home the winner just before half-time . nuremberg is now fourth from bottom , a precarious four points ahead of last-ranked kaiserslautern . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin pins down mighty bayern bayern munich moved nine points clear at the top of the bundesliga on tuesday but were frustrated by hertha berlin who held them to a goalless draw in the german capital .

his 1995 film " dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge " -lrb- brave heart will take the bride -rrb- is considered a milestone in indian film history for portraying indians living abroad for the first time .
last year , his film " veer zara " -lrb- a love legend -rrb- , which is set in india and pakistan and broke all box office records there , showed at the berlinale . dw-world : is this the first time you 're part of a jury for a big international film festival ? yes .
i do n't think there 's been an indian on the jury of any big international film festival in the past years .
three years ago mira nair of " monsoon wedding " fame headed the jury at the berlinale .
but she 's considered an international filmmaker .
i 'm happy to be part of the jury because it 's not just an honor for me , but for our film industry and our country . you 're going to be watching 26 films over the next 10 days .
that sounds grueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chopra -lrb- center -rrb- with the jury members and berlinale head , dieter kosslick -lrb- left -rrb- but as a filmmaker , watching films is n't really a tiring job .
every time you watch a new movie , it 's a new experience and you discover fresh subjects .
so for us it 's part of the job and not really that stressful . what is the selection process like ? are you given a checklist ? we 're not briefed or instructed by anyone in advance .
all we 're told as jury members is to watch movies and form our own opinions .
towards the end the eight jury members have a meeting where we eventually decide the winners .
it 's a very independent process and completely free of any external pressure . the jury members are drawn from different countries .
what kind of a perspective are you bringing to the jury ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood has millions of indian fans when you come as a filmmaker to such an important and interesting film festival as this one , your perspective changes .
here you ca n't watch a movie colored by your own lens , it 's a much more independent process .
in india of course , we make films which are very different and i 'm not apologetic about it , in fact i 'm proud of it .
indian movies have their own charm and color .
but these days of course things are changing and we 're making all kinds of movies - even movies without songs ! bollywood is also big in germany . how do you explain its increasing popularity in the west ? ten years ago , we released the film " dilwale dulhania le jayenge , " and the indian audience , even the indian diaspora abroad , identified with the characters .
and to reach a wider english-speaking audience , we began subtitling films in english and then even in languages like arabic , french , spanish , etc .
ever since , indian films have really taken off in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood icons kajol and shahrukh khan starred in dilwale dulhania le jayenge with " veer zara " we 've noticed that the overseas market , places like england , canada and the us which have a large indian diaspora , is where the films are most successful .
for indians living abroad , many of whom are n't rich enough to visit india every year , this is the only emotional link to their home country . your early films in the 1960s and 1970s focused on social issues . and starting in the early 1990s , they began to revolve almost exclusively around love .
what brought about that change ? you have to change with the times .
and i guess with time , i became very comfortable making movies on human relations - you can call it love or romanticism or by any other name .
i feel love can never go out of fashion .
i came to berlin last year for a few showings of " veer zara " before it was officially released and even before it got its german subtitles .
i was worried that germans would n't come and see the movie with its english subtitles , but the tickets were actually sold out .
when i presented the film i spoke of its relevance to berlin with its own divided history and the parallels between " veer zara , " which is set in the punjab and deals with a love affair between an indian and a pakistani , and the former berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 56th berlinale runs from jan .
9 -19 and then i found out that the organizer had failed to tell the audience that there was n't going to be an interval .
i was worried that germans would n't hang around for three and a half hours , that they would be bored and walk out .
but everybody stayed till the end and had tears in their eyes , they were so moved .
such is the power of emotions - and emotions are what i 'd like to focus on as long as i keep making films . what do you think of german cinema ? unfortunately there are n't any german film festivals in india regularly .
but i remember seeing two german films during a festival .
one of them was about the war and i thought the performances by the actors were brilliant .
germans are very good filmmakers . i 'm very sorry that films made in germany and elsewhere in europe do n't come to india regularly .
there should be an increased exchange of films because we can learn so much and get to know each other so much better that way .
even for a filmmaker like me , watching movies from all over the world , is very important .
that 's why i 'm very lucky to be part of the jury here at the berlinale - also because that way i get to see four german films at a time .
i 'm really looking forward to that . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed yash chopra send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

media watchdog reporters without borders claims that yahoo released data which led to the arrest of li zhi .
the online writer was jailed for eight years in 2003 , after posting comments that criticised official corruption .
last year yahoo was accused of giving information to beijing which led to the imprisonment of reporter shi tao .
reporters without borders called on yahoo to release the names of all internet writers whose identities it has revealed to the chinese authorities .
' rigorous procedures ' yahoo spokeswoman mary osako insisted that in its dealings with china , the company " only responded with what we were legally compelled to provide , and nothing more " .
" we were rigorous in our procedures and made sure that only the required material was provided , " she told the afp news agency .
chinese computer users are barred from some websites but she added that : " the government of china is not required to inform service providers why they are seeking certain information , and typically does not do so . "
reporters without borders said it was not acceptable for the firm to say it simply responded to requests from the authorities without knowing what the data would be used for .
" this argument no longer holds water , " the group said in a statement .
" yahoo certainly knew it was helping to arrest political dissidents and journalists , not just ordinary criminals . "
strict control the chinese government enforces strict laws on internet use , blocking content it considers a threat , including references to the tiananmen square massacre and notable dissidents .
but major international firms wanting to do business in china , the world 's number two internet market , are coming under increasing pressure from rights groups not to conform to beijing 's conditions .
four major us-based companies - microsoft , google , yahoo and cisco - have been accused of collaborating with china to censor the internet .
in september , yahoo was accused of helping the chinese authorities identify shi tao , who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in april 2005 .
google came under fire last month after it announced it would block politically sensitive terms on its new china site , in agreement with conditions set by beijing .
us lawmakers are due to meet later this month to discuss the ethical responsibilities of us-based internet companies doing business in china .

andrew lindberg was managing director of the australian wheat exporter awb .
an inquiry is currently investigating claims that the firm paid more than $ 200m to saddam hussein 's regime , as part of the un oil-for-food programme .
awb denies any wrongdoing , but an earlier investigation by the un said it should have known the money was going into the pockets of iraqi ministers .
the allegations have provoked an uproar in australia , with opposition claims - which the government has denied - that it knew about the kickbacks allegedly paid to iraq .

an australian media frenzy must be a horrible thing to be the subject of the australian 's foreign editor australia 's media reacts the firm was the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods under the un-sponsored oil-for-food programme in iraq between 1996 and 2003 , which allowed the iraqis to sell oil and import food and medicine despite being under sanctions .
at the time awb was the government wheat board , but it is now a privately listed company .
the inquiry was established by prime minister john howard after a un report in 2004 named a long list of companies it claimed paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime .
awb executives say they were duped into believing that fees paid to baghdad were meant to cover the costs of transporting grain .
but a un investigation said they should have realised what was actually going on .
the australian inquiry is trying to determine if awb broke any national laws in its oil-for-food dealings .
the investigators are due to report their findings in late march .

at the time awb was the government wheat board , but it is now a privately listed company .
the inquiry was established by prime minister john howard after a un report in 2004 named a long list of companies it claimed paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's regime .
awb executives say they were duped into believing that fees paid to baghdad were meant to cover the costs of transporting grain .

the australian inquiry is trying to determine if awb broke any national laws in its oil-for-food dealings .
the investigators are due to report their findings in late march .

andrew lindberg was managing director of the australian wheat exporter awb .
an inquiry is currently investigating claims that the firm paid more than $ 200m to saddam hussein 's regime , as part of the un oil-for-food programme .
awb denies any wrongdoing , but an earlier investigation by the un said it should have known the money was going into the pockets of iraqi ministers .
the allegations have provoked an uproar in australia , with opposition claims - which the government has denied - that it knew about the kickbacks allegedly paid to iraq .
largest supplier mr lindberg 's resignation - effective from april - is the first since the inquiry into awb 's deals in iraq began last month in sydney .
" the board thanks mr lindberg for his contribution to the company , and for making this decision , believing that it is in the best interests of the company , " awb said in a statement on wednesday . "

its population of just under 3,000 may find themselves leading the welsh arm of an international campaign trying to combat fast food culture .
local group leader margaret rees said the carmarthenshire town had many of the basic requirements - including no fast food outlets .
supporters will meet on thursday night to rally the campaign .
desirable food shops , cafes , restaurants , hotels and shops margaret rees on llandeilo the first slow food association was founded in the mid-80s in piedmont , italy , to express concern about the spread of fast food outlets .
its website says it " opposes the standardisation of taste , defends the need for consumer information , protects cultural identities tied to food and gastronomic traditions , safeguards foods and cultivation and processing techniques inherited from tradition and defend domestic and wild animal and vegetable species " .
a fish and chip shop , but llandeilo 's version serves ' traditional ' fare the group says it has 80,000 members in more than 100 countries , and some areas have been designated a " cittaslow " , which translates literally as slow town , but the term " slow city " is used in english .
the shropshire town of ludlow was the uk 's first cittaslow , and ms rees , a food consultant , hopes llandeilo has the attributes to follow suit .
clean environment she said these included " ancient history , a folk and music culture , desirable food shops , cafes , restaurants , hotels and shops . "
its other attractions include a clean environment , an active recycling programme , combined with the traditional and bio-diverse agricultural , artisan food producers , top tourist locations , and open spaces .
what could be more relaxed than a leisurely lunch or afternoon tea ?
the campaign will need support from local authorities , but she believes gaining the status would also help the economy .
" the main thing is to increase awareness of the natural environment and also increase the economic growth of llandeilo , " she said .
on a visit to llandeilo , the bbc wales news website found nothing to suggest it would appeal to the mcburger brigade .
it basically has one main shopping street that runs the length of the town .
during the day , visitors can take their pick from a number of olde worlde tea rooms , an ice-cream parlour or one the pubs that serve food .
admittedly , there is an indian take-away , and directly opposite a chip shop - but the chippery is defended by ms rees as a traditional establishment distant from the world of fast food .
there is nothing more and it would appear that is how the locals like it .
the only glare is from a belisha beacon or a passing car unlike many even smaller towns these days , there are no glaring neon signs .
the lack of takeaways is matched by the absence of the sort of litter usually associated with them .
and the double yellow lines down both sides of the narrow high street mean cars could not park even if there was a burger bar to dash into .
ms rees estimates it could take a number of years for llandeilo to become a cittaslow .
but like everyone else in the slow food movement , she is prepared to wait .

network rail said it is making progress on its trent valley four tracking -lrb- tv4 -rrb- project to double the number of tracks through tamworth .
it will include new bridges and traffic management to make sure motorists , other traffic and pedestrians can continue to travel across the railway .
it is part of the upgrade to the west coast main line to allow 125mph trains .
work starts this week next to the track in the anders and alders areas .
site hoardings are going up and test soil nails - to stabilise the tracks - will be put in the sides of the track cuttings .
most of the earth will be moved away by trains to minimise the amount of traffic using roads .
keith riley , tv4 senior programme manager for the project , said : " this project will deliver a major improvement to the railway through tamworth but necessitates some intensive work in the community . "
the upper gungate bridge will be demolished and replaced , and there will be work to move a public footpath at the side of wiggington park starting this month .
the £ 8bn modernisation project , allowing tilting trains from london to the midlands the north and glasgow , is scheduled for completion in 2009 .

each of the three enjoys billions of pounds in annual turnover and profits in the hundreds of millions .
yet far from being praised , they are at best conveniently ignored , at worst damned .
welcome to the controversial , if highly successful , world of big tobacco .
the three uk cigarette giants are british american tobacco -lrb- bat -rrb- , imperial and gallaher , occupying the second , fourth and fifth spots in the tobacco world rankings .
all members of the ftse 100 index of the largest british listed companies , their collective global operations contribute £ 2.9bn of annual pre-tax profits to the uk economy .
not bad for selling something that - while perfectly legal - can kill you .
worldwide reach selling the product may be legal , but using it - at least in public - is becoming more of a problem .
with a ban on smoking in public places scheduled to come into force in scotland next month , and in the rest of the uk some time next year , you would imagine that the three firms are due for a substantial squeeze in their home market .
however , each predicts the bans will only have a limited one-off effect .
more importantly , they are all now such global players that the uk represents only a minority of their business .
their operations circle the planet , taking in europe , africa , the middle east , the far east and the americas .
overseas sales at imperial , which owns lambert & butler and west , now contribute more than 60 % of its profits .
similarly , the uk is only a very minor market for bat , whose portfolio includes lucky strike , dunhill and royals .
gallaher , which makes popular uk cigarette brands bensons & hedges , silk cut and mayfair , estimates that an irish-style outright ban on smoking in public places would only cause a temporary drop in cigarette sales .
" the overall impact appears to be a one-off , one-year decline of between 3 % and 5 % , " says gallaher 's claire jenkins .
developing world bat spokesman dave betteridge freely admits the company is targeting developing countries to offset declining sales in the west .

source : ash " it is perfectly true that the incidence of smoking is falling in western europe , north america and other countries too , " he says .
" but developing countries are making up for that - their populations are increasing . "
the big prize is china , home to a third of the world 's smokers .
currently , the chinese government continues to maintain a state monopoly on cigarettes and other tobacco products .
but the big tobacco firms are banking on an eventual opening up , thanks to china 's recent membership of the world trade organization .
new markets - same customers ?
whether in china , africa or elsewhere , one charge the companies are keen to deny is that of targeting the developing world for new smokers .
" people in every country around the world already smoke - you ca n't un-invent smoking , " says dave betteridge .
" all we are doing is saying : ' how about smoking some international cigarettes instead of your local brand ? '
smoking is in decline in western europe " it is much like any consumer brand - you get a bit richer and wish to trade up . "
the total number of world smokers , bat estimates , will remain flat at about one billion .
" our marketing activities are focused on existing adult smokers , " says gallaher 's claire jenkins .
" we are not trying to promote the act of smoking . "
similarly , the companies resist the accusation that by targeting poorer countries , they are taking advantage of populations where knowledge of the health issues surrounding smoking is less widespread .
" we have health warning on our pack in every market , even those in which they are still not legally required , in the appropriate language , " ms jenkins says .
" regarding emerging markets , it is inconceivable that adults in those markets are not aware of the health risk . "
imperial 's head of media alex parsons adds that it is too simplistic to say the cigarette firms are now only interested in the developing world .
" in western europe for example , our market share ranges from just over 1 % in italy and up to 7 % in greece , so although these markets are in decline , we have an opportunity to get a bigger slice of the pie . "
aspirational brand names unsurprisingly , anti-smoking groups remain cynical about the tobacco industry 's protestations of piety .
all smoking advertising is today banned in the european union " the tobacco companies will always say they operate according to the laws of a particular country , " says a spokeswoman for uk anti-tobacco campaigners ash .
" that hides the fact that in many poorer countries with no tobacco control legislation , there can be no health warnings , or else they are very tiny indeed .
" tobacco firms also take free rein in naming their products things like glamour , vogue or diplomat to give an aspiration of western wealth and lifestyles . "
ash is also damning of the tobacco industry 's ongoing refusal to accept that second-hand smoke is dangerous .
the industry instead insists there is no scientific data to yet confirm that passive smoking is bad for your health , and it will instead only accept that background smoke is an " annoyance " .

bat 's dave betteridge recognises the clash between the financial success of the industry , and the might of opposition it attracts .
" as a business tobacco has rather more enemies than fans , but it is n't about to go bust , " he says .
" the industry continues to do extremely well . "

" regarding emerging markets , it is inconceivable that adults in those markets are not aware of the health risk . "
imperial 's head of media alex parsons adds that it is too simplistic to say the cigarette firms are now only interested in the developing world .
" in western europe for example , our market share ranges from just over 1 % in italy and up to 7 % in greece , so although these markets are in decline , we have an opportunity to get a bigger slice of the pie . "
aspirational brand names unsurprisingly , anti-smoking groups remain cynical about the tobacco industry 's protestations of piety .
all smoking advertising is today banned in the european union " the tobacco companies will always say they operate according to the laws of a particular country , " says a spokeswoman for uk anti-tobacco campaigners ash .
" that hides the fact that in many poorer countries with no tobacco control legislation , there can be no health warnings , or else they are very tiny indeed .
" tobacco firms also take free rein in naming their products things like glamour , vogue or diplomat to give an aspiration of western wealth and lifestyles . "
ash is also damning of the tobacco industry 's ongoing refusal to accept that second-hand smoke is dangerous .
the industry instead insists there is no scientific data to yet confirm that passive smoking is bad for your health , and it will instead only accept that background smoke is an " annoyance " .

the 86 leaders are running prominent adverts in newspapers and on tv urging christians and the us government to do more to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
scientists say co2 emissions are one of the main causes of global warming .
evangelicals have been staunch bush supporters but this push puts them at odds with presidential policy .
presidential catalyst ?
the president opposes the kyoto protocol on climate change on the grounds that it would harm the economy and does not require developing countries to make cuts .
but the signatories say many christians support their campaign and would be willing to back it even if there were an economic cost for the us . "
with god 's help global warming can be stopped for our kids , our world and our lord " evangelical campaign advert the newspaper advertisement - signed by mega-church pastors like rick warren , author of the bestseller the purpose-driven life , heads of christian colleges and missionary organisations - puts saving " god 's green earth " on a par with traditional evangelical concerns like abortion and gay marriage .
" with god 's help global warming can be stopped for our kids , our world and our lord , " the advert says .
and it calls on congress to do more to encourage companies to reduce carbon emissions , advocating a market-based approach to curb emissions through a cap-and-trade bill .
the evangelists who have signed up for the campaign do not include all of those most closely associated with the white house .
but the bbc 's justin webb in washington says a vigorous debate among evangelicals would unquestionably be taken into account by president george w bush and , more importantly perhaps , by those in the republican party who would like to replace him in 2008 .
resistance within the religious right has embraced environmental issues in recent years , most notably with a " what would jesus drive ? " campaign against sports utility vehicles .
but the latest move has prompted a backlash from some of the most influential conservative christians .
james dobson 's focus on the family called it a " distraction " from abortion and family values .
and richard land of the southern baptist convention , a friend of mr bush 's , says the science on climate change remains inconclusive .
" among american evangelicals there is no consensus about the causes of global warming , severity of global warming , or the solutions to global warming , " he said .
mr land was among those who sent a letter to the national association of evangelicals -lrb- nae -rrb- - which claims to represent 30 million christians - calling on it to distance itself from this campaign .

the 86 leaders are running prominent adverts in newspapers and on tv urging christians and the us government to do more to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
scientists say co2 emissions are one of the main causes of global warming .
evangelicals have been staunch bush supporters but this push puts them at odds with presidential policy .
presidential catalyst ?
the president opposes the kyoto protocol on climate change on the grounds that it would harm the economy and does not require developing countries to make cuts .
but the signatories say many christians support their campaign and would be willing to back it even if there were an economic cost for the us .
with god 's help global warming can be stopped for our kids , our world and our lord evangelical campaign advert seeking cure for us oil addiction the newspaper advertisement - signed by mega-church pastors like rick warren , author of the bestseller the purpose-driven life , heads of christian colleges and missionary organisations - puts saving " god 's green earth " on a par with traditional evangelical concerns like abortion and gay marriage .
" with god 's help global warming can be stopped for our kids , our world and our lord , " the advert says .
and it calls on congress to do more to encourage companies to reduce carbon emissions , advocating a market-based approach to curb emissions through a cap-and-trade bill .
the evangelists who have signed up for the campaign do not include all of those most closely associated with the white house .
but the bbc 's justin webb in washington says a vigorous debate among evangelicals would unquestionably be taken into account by president george w bush and , more importantly perhaps , by those in the republican party who would like to replace him in 2008 .
resistance within the religious right has embraced environmental issues in recent years , most notably with a " what would jesus drive ? " campaign against sports utility vehicles .
the us accounts for a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions but the latest move has prompted a backlash from some of the most influential conservative christians .
james dobson 's focus on the family called it a " distraction " from abortion and family values .
and richard land of the southern baptist convention , a friend of mr bush 's , says the science on climate change remains inconclusive .
" among american evangelicals there is no consensus about the causes of global warming , severity of global warming , or the solutions to global warming , " he said .

in september 2004 microsoft released the sp2 update for windows xp which introduced a security console that users could use to check the status of their anti-virus software , firewall and windows updates .
in the past few years it has also bought some security companies and has used their software as the basis for the new service .

earlier this year symantec declared its intent to produce an all-in-one software package of security software called genesis in late 2006 .
however , microsoft said its package of products was intended for those windows users who do not update their protections or have no security software installed at all .
microsoft claims that 70 % of windows users fall into this category .

it will roll together a firewall as well as anti-virus and anti-spyware programs plus backup and computer maintenance tools .
the package of programs will cost $ 49 for a year 's subscription .
prices and launch dates for the rest of the world have not yet been announced .
up to three computers can be protected with the software .
those americans keen to test the service can sign up in april and get a year 's subscription for $ 19.95 .
in launching its own-brand anti-virus and security products microsoft will be taking on firms that are firmly established brands in home security software such as symantec , mcafee , trend micro and many others .
earlier this year symantec declared its intent to produce an all-in-one software package of security software called genesis in late 2006 .
however , microsoft said its package of products was intended for those windows users who do not update their protections or have no security software installed at all .
microsoft claims that 70 % of windows users fall into this category .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- what the muhammad cartoons portray bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 9 february 2006 , 09:24 gmt what the muhammad cartoons portray by martin asser bbc news twelve caricatures of the prophet muhammad published in 2005 have had a huge impact around the world , with riots in many muslim countries causing deaths and destruction - so what do the drawings actually say ?
they originally appeared in the best-selling danish newspaper jyllands-posten on 30 september to accompany an editorial criticising self-censorship in the danish media .
since then some media outlets have republished the pictures in solidarity or outrage , while others - including the bbc - have refrained from publishing them to avoid causing offence to their audiences .
the issue arose after danish writer kare bluitgen complained he was unable to find an illustrator for his children 's book about the prophet because he said no one dared break an islamic tenet banning the portrayal of his image . "
we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end " jyllands-posten editorial jyllands-posten asked cartoonists to " draw the prophet as they saw him " , as an assertion of free speech and to reject pressure by muslims groups to respect their sensitivities .
the paper chose as its central image a visual joke about the prophet among other turban-wearing figures in a police line-up and the witness saying : " i do n't know which one he is " .
it is presumably an ironic appeal for calm over the issue , the suggestion being that , if a danish illustrator were to portray the prophet , it is not known what he looks like and is therefore a harmless gesture .
the humour comes from the fact that the line-up also includes people like jesus christ , the far-right danish politician pia kjaersgaard and mr bluitgen himself .
' pr stunt ' eleven other cartoons are printed around the edge of the page showing the prophet in a variety of supposedly humorous or satirical situations .
one seems to criticise mr bluitgen for exploiting the issue for publicity to sell his book .
he is portrayed holding a child 's drawing of the prophet , while an orange inscribed with " pr stunt " drops into a turban he is wearing .
-lrb- the expression " orange in the turban " connotes a " piece of luck " in danish . -rrb-
other images appear not especially critical of islam in their content .
one shows the prophet wandering through the desert with the sun setting behind him .
in another his face merges with an islamic star and crescent .
several cartoonists , however , do seem to take the jyllands-posten commission as an invitation to be deliberately provocative towards muslims .
critical views the most controversial image shows the prophet muhammad carrying a lit bomb in the shape of a turban on his head decorated with the islamic creed .
the face is angry , dangerous-looking - a stereotypical villain with heavy , dark eyebrows and whiskers .
another shows muhammad brandishing a sword ready for a fight .
his eyes are blacked out while two women stand behind him with their islamic dress leaving only their eyes uncovered .
two of the critical cartoons do not show the prophet at all .
one uses crescent moons and stars of david to form repeated abstract shapes , possibly showing women in islamic dress .
a poem accompanies the shapes , that one translator has rendered as : " prophet , you crazy bloke !
keeping women under yoke . "
in the other , a schoolboy points to a blackboard on which it is written in farsi : " the editorial team of jyllands-posten are a bunch of reactionary provocateurs " .
the boy is labelled " mohammed , valby school , 7a " , suggesting he is a second-generation iranian immigrant to denmark .
" the future " is written on his shirt .
humorous views other cartoonists have clearly attempted a more humorous approach - as with the central image - although the images will be no less offensive to muslims .
for example , one shows muhammad standing on a cloud holding back a line of smouldering suicide bombers trying to get into heaven .
" stop , stop , we have run out of virgins , " he says .
this is a reference to the supposed reward of 72 virgins in heaven for muslim martyrs , although islamic scholars often point out that there is no specific belief of this kind .
another drawing shows muhammad looking at a sheet of paper , but holding back two sword-wielding assassins .
" relax guys , it 's just a drawing made by some infidel south jutlander -lrb- ie from the middle of nowhere -rrb- , " the figure says .
one cartoonist portrays muhammad with a kind of halo around his head , but it could be a crescent moon , or a pair of devil 's horns .
anger and confusion the last cartoon on the page goes back to the theme of artistic freedom : a cartoonist draws an arab face with headdress , inscribed " mohammed " , but he crouches over the drawing and shields it with his hand .
the jyllands-posten cartoons do not include some images that may have had a role in bringing the issue to international attention .
three images in particular have done the rounds , in gaza for example , which are reported to be considerably more obscene and were mistakenly assumed to have been part of the jyllands-posten set .
one of the pictures , a photocopied photograph of a man with a pig 's ears and snout , has been identified as an old associated press picture from a french " pig-squealing " contest .
it was reportedly circulated by danish muslims to illustrate the atmosphere of islamophobia which they say they live under .
there is no doubt that the some of the original jyllands-posten cartoons are sufficiently hostile in nature to be taken as provocative by the muslim community , whatever their intention .
but some critics have said all the drawings and the manner of their publication betray european arrogance and islamophia .
muslim writer ziauddin sardar likens them to anti-semitic images published in europe in the 1920s and 30s , with muslims being demonised as violent , backward and fanatical .
" freedom of expression is not about doing whatever we want to do because we can do it , " he wrote in the independent on sunday .
" it is about creating an open marketplace for ideas and debate where all , including the marginalised , can take part as equals . "
