but since then coach armin veh 's side has remained unbeaten in a march to the top of the table accumulating 24 points on the way , a point ahead of werder bremen and schalke 04 and four ahead of fourth-placed bayern . stuttgart will be without the suspended midfielder thomas hitzlsperger who has scored on each of his last three outings but was dismissed after picking up a second booking in sunday 's 2-1 defeat of hanover . veh also has several injury doubts including midfielder daniel bierofka and defenders ricardo osario and serdar tasci , while sidelined captain fernando meira continues to labor with a calf problem .
" of all teams at the top of the table we have the smallest squad , " said veh .
" now we will have to improvise . " stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez , at 21 one of several youngsters in the side , said the team will be under no pressure at bayern .

" we have been made to appear worse than we are , " magath said of the criticism of his team 's form .
" the league performances have not been overwhelming but there have been reasons for this ; the world cup , the injuries , a team which has to gel , " he told kicker . " the win in leverkusen was the crunch .
now things are on the up , " he added . bremen hope to bounce back from dortmund defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego and co. came unstuck against dortmund werder bremen will be seeking to show their 3-1 home defeat to borussia dortmund last friday was only a minor setback when they travel to lowly alemannia aachen . werder also have one eye on the visit of chelsea in the champions league next wednesday , but midfielder tim borowski - who made a brief comeback against dortmund following injury - said : " aachen is more important than chelsea right now .

" the fact i have been chosen in this way is extraordinary .
i want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy , " royal told reporters .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
she was also viewed as the candidate who best represented a much-needed change from politics-as-usual in france , which was the key to her meteoric rise in the polls . royal , sarkozy tied in the polls an ipsos opinion poll published in the french weekly le point predicted an even draw if royal and sarkozy faced each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's likely challenger , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy royal was elected to the national assembly in 1988 , and has served as environmental and family minister .
in 2004 , she was elected president of poitou charantes .
it was a stunning victory that propelled her into the national limelight .
during the campaign , royal cultivated a grass-roots , populist image , calling for " citizen juries " to judge the performance of elected officials , and focused on social issues such as juvenile deliquents , crime and education .
critics dismiss her as a lightweight , inexperienced in foreign policy and economic matters , and say that her candidacy was based more on style than substance .
the socialists hope that royal could help heal the rift the party suffered from last year 's referendum on the eu 's constitutional treaty , which france rejected .
born in senegal , where her father was stationed with the french army , royal graduated from sciences po and the l ´ école nationale d 'administration , two elite institutions which have produced generations of french leaders .

martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .

thirty percent ownership would constitute a takeover , a possibility which is becoming more and more plausible , despite the official company line to the contrary . however , there is currently a law on the books in the state of lower saxony , where volkswagen headquarters are located , which stipulates that no shareholder can gain more than 20 percent of the vote , regardless of their proportion of the shares . the law is generally seen as a way for lower saxony to maintain its majority influence in the corporation .

title rivals werder bremen and schalke 04 hope to capitalize on any slip-ups . stuttgart 's season began with a 3-0 home defeat to nuremberg which was followed two weeks later by a 3-1 loss at home to borussia dortmund .
but since then coach armin veh 's side has remained unbeaten in a march to the top of the table accumulating 24 points on the way , a point ahead of werder bremen and schalke 04 and four ahead of fourth-placed bayern . stuttgart will be without the suspended midfielder thomas hitzlsperger who has scored on each of his last three outings but was dismissed after picking up a second booking in sunday 's 2-1 defeat of hanover . veh also has several injury doubts including midfielder daniel bierofka and defenders ricardo osario and serdar tasci , while sidelined captain fernando meira continues to labor with a calf problem .
" of all teams at the top of the table we have the smallest squad , " said veh .
" now we will have to improvise . " stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez , at 21 one of several youngsters in the side , said the team will be under no pressure at bayern .

with takeover bids and restructuring on the agenda , he 'll have plenty on his plate . after a preliminary decision last week by the executive committee , the board of wolfsburg-based volkswagen announced friday that the head of the audi brand will take charge of the whole vw group .
martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .
he did not make a resignation announcement at thursday 's board meeting , as had been expected , reported ard online .
no further information was given at friday 's meeting . new ceo plans centralization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn wants to improve the efficiency of the vw machine supposedly , bernhard wants to go because winterkorn 's restructuring plans would mean a loss of influence for him . the audi boss reportedly aims to create a centralized model and to align development and production functions in order to avoid redundancies . increasing productivity will also be high on his to-do list .
it now takes workers 47 hours to assemble a volkswagen gold , while a toyota corolla , a ford focus and an opel astra can be built in half that amount of time - which does n't add up to a competitive edge . winterkorn 's restructuring plans " glaringly contradict the rules of good management , according to which the board should supervise the managers but should n't run the company , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in its friday edition . porsche takeover still plausible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say piech is holding the reigns , or at least the keys some suspect that the driving force behind bernd pischetsrieder 's resignation on nov .

as chairman of the volkswagen board and a member of the porsche family -lrb- he is the grandson of ferdinand porsche , who developed the first volkswagen beetle in the 1930 's -rrb- , he is influential from multiple angles . as of wednesday , porsche now owns 27.4 percent of the volkswagen group .
thirty percent ownership would constitute a takeover , a possibility which is becoming more and more plausible , despite the official company line to the contrary . however , there is currently a law on the books in the state of lower saxony , where volkswagen headquarters are located , which stipulates that no shareholder can gain more than 20 percent of the vote , regardless of their proportion of the shares . the law is generally seen as a way for lower saxony to maintain its majority influence in the corporation .
the state owns 20.8 percent of the total shares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will take over whom ?
the european commission has indicated that the law may stand in violation of european law and the european court of justice is expected to overturn it by next summer .
initial discussions on the matter are scheduled to begin on december 12 . man-scania a hot topic volkswagen also has a more concrete takeover bid on the table right now .
munich-based truck manufacturer man bid on thursday to buy up its swedish competitor scania for 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . volkswagen has more than 34 percent ownership in scania and , since october , 15.6 percent in man .

with takeover bids and restructuring on the agenda , he 'll have plenty on his plate . after a preliminary decision last week by the executive committee , the board of wolfsburg-based volkswagen announced friday that the head of the audi brand will take charge of the whole vw group .
martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .
he did not make a resignation announcement at thursday 's board meeting , as had been expected , reported ard online .
no further information was given at friday 's meeting . new ceo plans centralization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn wants to improve the efficiency of the vw machine supposedly , bernhard wants to go because winterkorn 's restructuring plans would mean a loss of influence for him . the audi boss reportedly aims to create a centralized model and to align development and production functions in order to avoid redundancies . increasing productivity will also be high on his to-do list .
it now takes workers 47 hours to assemble a volkswagen gold , while a toyota corolla , a ford focus and an opel astra can be built in half that amount of time - which does n't add up to a competitive edge . winterkorn 's restructuring plans " glaringly contradict the rules of good management , according to which the board should supervise the managers but should n't run the company , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in its friday edition . porsche takeover still plausible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say piech is holding the reigns , or at least the keys some suspect that the driving force behind bernd pischetsrieder 's resignation on nov .

" germany is one of the biggest customers of libyan crude .
there is enormous potential in natural gas , which has remained largely unexplored . in germany , there is so much talk about energy diversification , so it is about time that we act on it , " said reinier zwitsersloot , head of the energy group wintershall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to reduce its dependance on oil and gas from russia talks on human rights and press freedoms in tunesia on friday steinmeier was in tunesia , the third stop of his five nation tour .

with takeover bids and restructuring on the agenda , he 'll have plenty on his plate . after a preliminary decision last week by the executive committee , the board of wolfsburg-based volkswagen announced friday that the head of the audi brand will take charge of the whole vw group .
martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .
he did not make a resignation announcement at thursday 's board meeting , as had been expected , reported ard online .
no further information was given at friday 's meeting . new ceo plans centralization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn wants to improve the efficiency of the vw machine supposedly , bernhard wants to go because winterkorn 's restructuring plans would mean a loss of influence for him . the audi boss reportedly aims to create a centralized model and to align development and production functions in order to avoid redundancies . increasing productivity will also be high on his to-do list .
it now takes workers 47 hours to assemble a volkswagen gold , while a toyota corolla , a ford focus and an opel astra can be built in half that amount of time - which does n't add up to a competitive edge . winterkorn 's restructuring plans " glaringly contradict the rules of good management , according to which the board should supervise the managers but should n't run the company , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in its friday edition . porsche takeover still plausible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say piech is holding the reigns , or at least the keys some suspect that the driving force behind bernd pischetsrieder 's resignation on nov .
7 and the management modifications is ferdinand piëch .
as chairman of the volkswagen board and a member of the porsche family -lrb- he is the grandson of ferdinand porsche , who developed the first volkswagen beetle in the 1930 's -rrb- , he is influential from multiple angles . as of wednesday , porsche now owns 27.4 percent of the volkswagen group .
thirty percent ownership would constitute a takeover , a possibility which is becoming more and more plausible , despite the official company line to the contrary . however , there is currently a law on the books in the state of lower saxony , where volkswagen headquarters are located , which stipulates that no shareholder can gain more than 20 percent of the vote , regardless of their proportion of the shares . the law is generally seen as a way for lower saxony to maintain its majority influence in the corporation .
the state owns 20.8 percent of the total shares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will take over whom ?
the european commission has indicated that the law may stand in violation of european law and the european court of justice is expected to overturn it by next summer .

dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .

" the fact i have been chosen in this way is extraordinary .
i want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy , " royal told reporters .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
she was also viewed as the candidate who best represented a much-needed change from politics-as-usual in france , which was the key to her meteoric rise in the polls . royal , sarkozy tied in the polls an ipsos opinion poll published in the french weekly le point predicted an even draw if royal and sarkozy faced each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's likely challenger , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy royal was elected to the national assembly in 1988 , and has served as environmental and family minister .

it was a stunning victory that propelled her into the national limelight .
during the campaign , royal cultivated a grass-roots , populist image , calling for " citizen juries " to judge the performance of elected officials , and focused on social issues such as juvenile deliquents , crime and education .
critics dismiss her as a lightweight , inexperienced in foreign policy and economic matters , and say that her candidacy was based more on style than substance .
the socialists hope that royal could help heal the rift the party suffered from last year 's referendum on the eu 's constitutional treaty , which france rejected .
born in senegal , where her father was stationed with the french army , royal graduated from sciences po and the l ´ école nationale d 'administration , two elite institutions which have produced generations of french leaders .

european union lawmakers on thursday denounced world powers for a failure to tackle the ongoing middle east crisis , highlighting the inaction of the united states to push for peace in the palestinian-israel conflict . the us must reassess its role in the israeli-palestinian conflict and in the so-called middle east quartet , euro mps said in a resolution thursday , pressing washington for fresh action to stop the violence and to restart the stalled peace process . the international quartet , which is working for peace in the middle east , also includes the eu , russia and the united nations . eu parliamentarians deplored a " lack of a strong and clear stance by the international community on the current crisis , " urging quartet members to take immediate action to resume negotiations between israelis and palestinians and to implement the so-called roadmap for two independent states in the region . they also called for an international peace conference , adding that unilateral approaches by the conflict parties have to be rejected . european union officials also proposed deploying a multinational force to gaza and the west bank to protect israeli and palestinian civilians . eu stresses need for responsibility in region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions between palestinians and israelis are high calling on the eu and its member states to engage in reviving israeli-palestinian peace negotiations , the euro mps stressed the bloc 's " special responsibility for peace and security in the middle east , which is in europe 's neighborhood . " the eu must also continue giving humanitarian aid to the palestinian people by further extending a so-called temporary aid mechanism agreed by the eu and the us . the 105 million euro aid program provides for the payment of " special allowances " to palestinian health workers and other special groups .
it is expected to run out at the end of the year . europeans call for palestinian unity government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stance of hamas is making things harder earlier this month , the eu called for the rapid formation of a palestinian national unity government to ease the damaging international , political and financial boycott of the hamas-led palestinian authority . the 25-member bloc and the us cut off aid to the palestinian authority following the election victory of hamas earlier this year .
the militant palestinian group is classified as a terrorist organization by both the eu and the us . brussels has said it will resume aid flows once hamas recognizes israel , renounces violence and agrees to abide by past peace treaties . dw staff -lrb- sj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .

" the fact i have been chosen in this way is extraordinary .
i want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy , " royal told reporters .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
she was also viewed as the candidate who best represented a much-needed change from politics-as-usual in france , which was the key to her meteoric rise in the polls . royal , sarkozy tied in the polls an ipsos opinion poll published in the french weekly le point predicted an even draw if royal and sarkozy faced each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's likely challenger , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy royal was elected to the national assembly in 1988 , and has served as environmental and family minister .
in 2004 , she was elected president of poitou charantes .
it was a stunning victory that propelled her into the national limelight .
during the campaign , royal cultivated a grass-roots , populist image , calling for " citizen juries " to judge the performance of elected officials , and focused on social issues such as juvenile deliquents , crime and education .
critics dismiss her as a lightweight , inexperienced in foreign policy and economic matters , and say that her candidacy was based more on style than substance .
the socialists hope that royal could help heal the rift the party suffered from last year 's referendum on the eu 's constitutional treaty , which france rejected .
born in senegal , where her father was stationed with the french army , royal graduated from sciences po and the l ´ école nationale d 'administration , two elite institutions which have produced generations of french leaders .

with takeover bids and restructuring on the agenda , he 'll have plenty on his plate . after a preliminary decision last week by the executive committee , the board of wolfsburg-based volkswagen announced friday that the head of the audi brand will take charge of the whole vw group .
martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .
he did not make a resignation announcement at thursday 's board meeting , as had been expected , reported ard online .
no further information was given at friday 's meeting . new ceo plans centralization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn wants to improve the efficiency of the vw machine supposedly , bernhard wants to go because winterkorn 's restructuring plans would mean a loss of influence for him . the audi boss reportedly aims to create a centralized model and to align development and production functions in order to avoid redundancies . increasing productivity will also be high on his to-do list .
it now takes workers 47 hours to assemble a volkswagen gold , while a toyota corolla , a ford focus and an opel astra can be built in half that amount of time - which does n't add up to a competitive edge . winterkorn 's restructuring plans " glaringly contradict the rules of good management , according to which the board should supervise the managers but should n't run the company , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in its friday edition . porsche takeover still plausible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say piech is holding the reigns , or at least the keys some suspect that the driving force behind bernd pischetsrieder 's resignation on nov .
7 and the management modifications is ferdinand piëch .
as chairman of the volkswagen board and a member of the porsche family -lrb- he is the grandson of ferdinand porsche , who developed the first volkswagen beetle in the 1930 's -rrb- , he is influential from multiple angles . as of wednesday , porsche now owns 27.4 percent of the volkswagen group .
thirty percent ownership would constitute a takeover , a possibility which is becoming more and more plausible , despite the official company line to the contrary . however , there is currently a law on the books in the state of lower saxony , where volkswagen headquarters are located , which stipulates that no shareholder can gain more than 20 percent of the vote , regardless of their proportion of the shares . the law is generally seen as a way for lower saxony to maintain its majority influence in the corporation .
the state owns 20.8 percent of the total shares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will take over whom ?
the european commission has indicated that the law may stand in violation of european law and the european court of justice is expected to overturn it by next summer .
initial discussions on the matter are scheduled to begin on december 12 . man-scania a hot topic volkswagen also has a more concrete takeover bid on the table right now .
munich-based truck manufacturer man bid on thursday to buy up its swedish competitor scania for 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . volkswagen has more than 34 percent ownership in scania and , since october , 15.6 percent in man .
it could potentially force its own brazilian truck manufacture into the mix , or support a hostile takeover of man by scania , according to reports . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen ceo resigns , leaving hard decisions behind volkswagen 's chief executive bernd pischetsrieder will step down at the end of december .

business leaders accompanying german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the magreb countries , are keen to secure energy deals in liquid gas and oil what 's good for foreign affairs is good for business , especially in the energy sector , where germany imports crude oil from libya , and natural gas from algeria . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is on a five day tour of the magreb countries with a delegation of business leaders , has stressed the importance of the north african region for supplying energy to the european union , thereby reducing the bloc 's dependance on oil and gas from russian pipelines . bilateral ties with algeria in natural gas in algeria on thursday , steinmeier held talks with prime minister abdelaziz belkhadem and energy minister chekib khalil , mainly focusing on energy issues .
germany and algeria are to increase bilateral cooperation , particularly in natural gas production and supply . the german utility giant e-on signed a declaraton of intent with sonatrach , the algerian state energy company to supply liquid natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- that can be transported by sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ship transporting liquid natural gas " this deal is part of our diversification strategy .
we are procuring natural gas from six countries already and are adding algeria to list , " said dietrich gerstein , vice-president of e-on 's natural and liquid gas division . gerstein spoke of the important collaboration between e-on and sonatrach , which now supplies 26 billion cubic meters of gas annually with a target of 85 billion cubic meters per year by 2020 . germany currently sources its entire supply of natural gas via pipeline connections and is seeking to secure more supplies of lng . algeria 's rich natural resources helps to settle foreign debt " we value algeria as a reliable energy provider , " said steinmeier . german firms are meanwhile hoping to secure contracts under planned algerian infrastructure projects estimated to be worth around 80 billion dollars until 2009 . revenues from energy sales , which are estimated at more than $ 50 billion for 2006 , has allowed algeria to settle its massive debt with germany , its fourth largest creditor . inspite of the its rich natural resources , one-third of algeria 's population is jobless and lives in poverty , with the government pocketing huge profits from gas and oil exports . algeria and libya as energy market of the future burocracy and inefficient administrative layers also pose obstacles to foreign firms doing business in the former french colony .
still , hans meier-ewert from the african association of german business in algeria sees it as market of the future .

with takeover bids and restructuring on the agenda , he 'll have plenty on his plate . after a preliminary decision last week by the executive committee , the board of wolfsburg-based volkswagen announced friday that the head of the audi brand will take charge of the whole vw group .
martin winterkorn is set to replace bernd pischetsrieder on january 1 , 2007 . winterkorn intends to assume the direction of the volkswagen brand himself , according to reports , which has led to speculation that current volkswagen boss wolfgang bernhard may resign . bernhard has overseen and initiated many reforms at volkswagen over the past year and a half .
he did not make a resignation announcement at thursday 's board meeting , as had been expected , reported ard online .
no further information was given at friday 's meeting . new ceo plans centralization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winterkorn wants to improve the efficiency of the vw machine supposedly , bernhard wants to go because winterkorn 's restructuring plans would mean a loss of influence for him . the audi boss reportedly aims to create a centralized model and to align development and production functions in order to avoid redundancies . increasing productivity will also be high on his to-do list .
it now takes workers 47 hours to assemble a volkswagen gold , while a toyota corolla , a ford focus and an opel astra can be built in half that amount of time - which does n't add up to a competitive edge . winterkorn 's restructuring plans " glaringly contradict the rules of good management , according to which the board should supervise the managers but should n't run the company , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in its friday edition . porsche takeover still plausible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say piech is holding the reigns , or at least the keys some suspect that the driving force behind bernd pischetsrieder 's resignation on nov .
7 and the management modifications is ferdinand piëch .
as chairman of the volkswagen board and a member of the porsche family -lrb- he is the grandson of ferdinand porsche , who developed the first volkswagen beetle in the 1930 's -rrb- , he is influential from multiple angles . as of wednesday , porsche now owns 27.4 percent of the volkswagen group .
thirty percent ownership would constitute a takeover , a possibility which is becoming more and more plausible , despite the official company line to the contrary . however , there is currently a law on the books in the state of lower saxony , where volkswagen headquarters are located , which stipulates that no shareholder can gain more than 20 percent of the vote , regardless of their proportion of the shares . the law is generally seen as a way for lower saxony to maintain its majority influence in the corporation .
the state owns 20.8 percent of the total shares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will take over whom ?
the european commission has indicated that the law may stand in violation of european law and the european court of justice is expected to overturn it by next summer .
initial discussions on the matter are scheduled to begin on december 12 . man-scania a hot topic volkswagen also has a more concrete takeover bid on the table right now .
munich-based truck manufacturer man bid on thursday to buy up its swedish competitor scania for 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . volkswagen has more than 34 percent ownership in scania and , since october , 15.6 percent in man .
it could potentially force its own brazilian truck manufacture into the mix , or support a hostile takeover of man by scania , according to reports . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen ceo resigns , leaving hard decisions behind volkswagen 's chief executive bernd pischetsrieder will step down at the end of december .

" the fact i have been chosen in this way is extraordinary .
i want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy , " royal told reporters .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
she was also viewed as the candidate who best represented a much-needed change from politics-as-usual in france , which was the key to her meteoric rise in the polls . royal , sarkozy tied in the polls an ipsos opinion poll published in the french weekly le point predicted an even draw if royal and sarkozy faced each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's likely challenger , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy royal was elected to the national assembly in 1988 , and has served as environmental and family minister .
in 2004 , she was elected president of poitou charantes .
it was a stunning victory that propelled her into the national limelight .
during the campaign , royal cultivated a grass-roots , populist image , calling for " citizen juries " to judge the performance of elected officials , and focused on social issues such as juvenile deliquents , crime and education .
critics dismiss her as a lightweight , inexperienced in foreign policy and economic matters , and say that her candidacy was based more on style than substance .
the socialists hope that royal could help heal the rift the party suffered from last year 's referendum on the eu 's constitutional treaty , which france rejected .
born in senegal , where her father was stationed with the french army , royal graduated from sciences po and the l ´ école nationale d 'administration , two elite institutions which have produced generations of french leaders .
at l 'ena , she met her partner francois hollande , who is head of the socialist party and father of her four children . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- merkel and chirac discuss joint policies in berlin a joint european energy policy and eu efforts to agree on a peacekeeping mission in congo were at the center of talks in berlin between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac .

" the fact i have been chosen in this way is extraordinary .
i want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy , " royal told reporters .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
dubbed the " darling of the polls , " royal was regarded as the candidate with the best chance of beating the likely conservative nominee , interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
she was also viewed as the candidate who best represented a much-needed change from politics-as-usual in france , which was the key to her meteoric rise in the polls . royal , sarkozy tied in the polls an ipsos opinion poll published in the french weekly le point predicted an even draw if royal and sarkozy faced each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal 's likely challenger , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy royal was elected to the national assembly in 1988 , and has served as environmental and family minister .
in 2004 , she was elected president of poitou charantes .
it was a stunning victory that propelled her into the national limelight .
during the campaign , royal cultivated a grass-roots , populist image , calling for " citizen juries " to judge the performance of elected officials , and focused on social issues such as juvenile deliquents , crime and education .
critics dismiss her as a lightweight , inexperienced in foreign policy and economic matters , and say that her candidacy was based more on style than substance .
the socialists hope that royal could help heal the rift the party suffered from last year 's referendum on the eu 's constitutional treaty , which france rejected .
born in senegal , where her father was stationed with the french army , royal graduated from sciences po and the l ´ école nationale d 'administration , two elite institutions which have produced generations of french leaders .
at l 'ena , she met her partner francois hollande , who is head of the socialist party and father of her four children . dw staff / dpa -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- merkel and chirac discuss joint policies in berlin a joint european energy policy and eu efforts to agree on a peacekeeping mission in congo were at the center of talks in berlin between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac .

last year the fortunes of the coliseum in porthmadog seemed to be looking up .
but 12 months on film showings have been cancelled because no-one turned up to watch them , and it now has only a few weeks to raise the money to ensure it survives .
the 500-seat cinema , which originally opened in 1931 , has been kept open by a group of local people for 22 years .
there is no point crying when the place closes emyr williams , volunteer volunteer director emyr williams said : " the running costs go up every year , on top of the usual maintenance and repair costs , and with audiences getting smaller that means less income and so less revenue . "
its future depended on raising £ 5,000 in the next few weeks , said mr williams .
" we decided in september to target 42 local businesses from criccieth , porthmadog and beddgelert , inviting them to sponsor us .
" the response has been poor however , with only eight businesses offering sponsorship - one for £ 2,000 and the others to the total of £ 4,000 - which is not enough to keep us going through the winter months . "
mr williams said the only hope now was for other businesses , or individuals , to come forward to offer financial backing , before the 2 december deadline .
sponsorship " we are asking for money in this way because it is the local community who own the coliseum cinema , following the successful campaign to rescue it from closing 22 years ago .
" we do n't want to lose this important community facility which has serviced the community since 1931 . "
the goal , he added , was to keep the cinema open for at least another few years .
" we managed to secure sponsorship last year , but now we are facing another winter .
" our heating boiler needs to be fixed , and we know we ca n't survive without backing .
" there is no point crying when the place closes . "
there is also an appeal for people to use the cinema .
films were not run on a few nights during september and october because no-one turned up to see them , he said .

rtl 's possible bid for itv could trump cable group ntl , which confirmed last week that it is interested in merging with itv , said the financial times .
it added that rtl would most likely have to sell its current uk tv business - five - to secure regulatory backing .
both rtl and itv have declined to comment on the report .

" rtl is an established free-to-air broadcaster on a pan-european basis .
" i 'm not saying there are huge synergies ... but rtl is in my mind a more credible bidder . "
weak advertising revenues itv , which has been hit by declining advertising , is currently in the process of drawing up a shortlist of possible candidates to take over as its new chief executive .
the broadcaster was a bid target earlier this year , but former chief executive charles allen rejected an approach from a consortium of private equity firms .

an action group has been set up to fight plans by powys local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- as it faces a £ 3.5m deficit .
vicar philip morris told the meeting people had lost trust in the lhb .
the lhb , which has proposed cuts at llanidloes , knighton , bronllys and builth wells , has said buildings are outdated and patients deserved better . "
write to mansion towers -lsb- lhb headquarters -rsb- or should i say ivory towers - no , fawlty towers " the reverend philip morris mr morris , of builth against closing hospitals -lrb- bach -rrb- , told the bbc wales news website : " we have spent two years talking with the lhb about a new hospital for builth and then they totally withdrew the plans .
" we even received assurances up until july that we were going to have a new hospital .
" but since the lhb meeting in september we 've lost total trust in them .
we are prepared for change , but not like this . "
during a rousing speech at thursday night 's meeting in the strand theatre , mr morris urged people to write to the lhb 's chairman and chief executive .
" write to mansion towers -lsb- the lhb 's headquarters is mansion house -rsb- or should i say ivory towers - no , fawlty towers , " he joked .
dr richard walters , gp at builth and llanwrtyd medical practice , called on people in the town to get behind the campaign to save the hospital .
he said the assembly government 's 10-year health care plan , design for life , meant some district general hospitals would be downgraded and some community hospitals would close to pay for specialist treatment in city hospitals .
he added : " this is fine if you live in a city , but not good if you live in rural powys , miles and miles from acute hospital services .
" our lhb , a rural lhb , should know better . "
he said changes to health care in wales would mean excellence in the cities and third world medicine in powys .
birthing centre bach has started a fighting fund to save the hospital and it has also begun a petition which so far has received 1,500 signatures .
thursday 's meeting also passed a vote of no confidence in the chair and chief executive of the lhb , and bach said it would inform assembly health minister brian gibbons .
builth wells is the latest community to stage a meeting in protest at the lhb 's plans for hospitals in powys .
last month , up to 1,000 people formed a human ring in the " hands around llanidloes hospital " demonstration .
in september , about 800 people turned out at a meeting in the town in a show of concern .
at llanidloes , the lhb plans to cut 18 beds , close an x-ray unit , a birthing centre and outpatient services .
bronllys , near brecon , and knighton could lose gp beds and maternity services , while 12 gp beds , outpatient and x-ray services could be cut at builth wells .
the lhb did not comment prior to the meeting , but in september its chief executive andy williams said he understood people 's attachment to their hospital .
he added : " we must not allow ourselves to measure the effectiveness of health services by the number of hospital beds and by bricks and mortar .
" some of our current buildings are outdated and we believe that the people of powys deserve better . "

builth is one of four community hospitals facing closure thursday 's meeting also passed a vote of no confidence in the chair and chief executive of the lhb , and bach said it would inform assembly health minister brian gibbons .
builth wells is the latest community to stage a meeting in protest at the lhb 's plans for hospitals in powys .
last month , up to 1,000 people formed a human ring in the " hands around llanidloes hospital " demonstration .
in september , about 800 people turned out at a meeting in the town in a show of concern .
at llanidloes , the lhb plans to cut 18 beds , close an x-ray unit , a birthing centre and outpatient services .
bronllys , near brecon , and knighton could lose gp beds and maternity services , while 12 gp beds , outpatient and x-ray services could be cut at builth wells .
the lhb did not comment prior to the meeting , but in september its chief executive andy williams said he understood people 's attachment to their hospital .
he added : " we must not allow ourselves to measure the effectiveness of health services by the number of hospital beds and by bricks and mortar .
" some of our current buildings are outdated and we believe that the people of powys deserve better . "

ms royal , 53 , described her win over two rivals in a ballot of party members as " extraordinary " , and said she wanted to write a new page in french history .
she won with more than 60 % of the vote , avoiding a second round .
the mother-of-four is widely expected to face centre-right hopeful nicolas sarkozy in the april poll . "
i want to embody this change and make it credible and legitimate " segolene royal profile : segolene royal send us your comments ms royal has promoted herself as a political outsider who can shake up a system with which many french people have grown disenchanted .
but bbc europe editor mark mardell says she has so far been decidedly light on policy detail and faces a relentless campaign against mr sarkozy .
speaking to reporters in poitou-charente , whose regional council she heads , ms royal expressed delight at the result .
" to be chosen in this way is something extraordinary , " she said .
" i want to embody this change and make it credible and legitimate .
" i think that tonight this legitimacy has been given to me and for this i want to thank party members from the bottom of my heart . "
race begins both rivals , former finance minister dominique strauss-kahn and ex-prime minister laurent fabius , conceded saying it was important for the socialists to forget their differences and focus on the election , which has been set for 22 april .
mr sarkozy has not officially announced that he is a candidate .
recent polls have suggested ms royal would stand an even chance of beating mr sarkozy in the presidential poll - but her two rivals would not .
the three contenders made bitter attacks on each other during the campaign .
if no candidate had achieved an overall majority of votes , there would have been a second round next week .
but party officials said 60.6 % of the party 's 220,000 members had plumped for ms royal , a former environment minister .
mr strauss-kahn took 20.8 % of the vote and mr fabius 18.5 % .
ms royal 's rivals tried to destabilise her campaign during the final days on the election trail .
teachers reacted angrily after a video appeared on the internet last week featuring a party meeting earlier this year in which she said they should work longer hours in school .
ms royal responded by highlighting what she described as " chauvinistic comments " made by her rival candidates , something they strongly denied .

race begins both rivals , former finance minister dominique strauss-kahn and ex-prime minister laurent fabius , conceded saying it was important for the socialists to forget their differences and focus on the election , which has been set for 22 april .
mr sarkozy has not officially announced that he is a candidate .
the socialist rivals were involved in a bitter campaign recent polls have suggested ms royal would stand an even chance of beating mr sarkozy in the presidential poll - but her two rivals would not .
the three contenders made bitter attacks on each other during the campaign .
if no candidate had achieved an overall majority of votes , there would have been a second round next week .
but party officials said 60.6 % of the party 's 220,000 members had plumped for ms royal , a former environment minister .
mr strauss-kahn took 20.8 % of the vote and mr fabius 18.5 % .
ms royal 's rivals tried to destabilise her campaign during the final days on the election trail .
teachers reacted angrily after a video appeared on the internet last week featuring a party meeting earlier this year in which she said they should work longer hours in school .
ms royal responded by highlighting what she described as " chauvinistic comments " made by her rival candidates , something they strongly denied .

but they 're best known for their three bond scripts including the current casino royale .
bbc world service arts correspondent vincent dowd met wade and purvis at the london headquarters of eon , the production company which for more than 40 years has put bond on screen .
whenever bond is re-cast the producers and writers say they plan to go back to something closer to the bond which ian fleming wrote in the 50s and 60s .
is that possible ?
wade - personally i really like the books : i came to them from the movies .
the films have this wonderful swoop to them but the books have more texture .
that 's to do with bond being this hard-living , dark creature in the middle of all that 's going on .
purvis - but it 's true that over the years the film character has developed into something quite different to fleming 's character .
though there 's often been talk of going back to basics with bond and making him more ' flemingian ' this was the best opportunity ever because we 're starting again with the first novel .
it was published in 1953 and it 's bond at the beginning of his career .
we still had to satisfy people 's expectations and have a certain amount of humour -that 's one of the biggest differences between the films and the books .
but we tried to be as faithful to the novel as possible and keep it fairly dark .
wade - sadistic !
surely one of the problems with bond has always been he remains essentially the same throughout the movie ?

but they 're best known for their three bond scripts including the current casino royale .
bbc world service arts correspondent vincent dowd met wade and purvis at the london headquarters of eon , the production company which for more than 40 years has put bond on screen .
whenever bond is re-cast the producers and writers say they plan to go back to something closer to the bond which ian fleming wrote in the 50s and 60s .
is that possible ?
wade - personally i really like the books : i came to them from the movies .
the films have this wonderful swoop to them but the books have more texture .
that 's to do with bond being this hard-living , dark creature in the middle of all that 's going on .
purvis - but it 's true that over the years the film character has developed into something quite different to fleming 's character .
though there 's often been talk of going back to basics with bond and making him more ' flemingian ' this was the best opportunity ever because we 're starting again with the first novel .
it was published in 1953 and it 's bond at the beginning of his career .
we still had to satisfy people 's expectations and have a certain amount of humour -that 's one of the biggest differences between the films and the books .
but we tried to be as faithful to the novel as possible and keep it fairly dark .
wade - sadistic !
surely one of the problems with bond has always been he remains essentially the same throughout the movie ?

but they 're best known for their three bond scripts including the current casino royale .
bbc world service arts correspondent vincent dowd met wade and purvis at the london headquarters of eon , the production company which for more than 40 years has put bond on screen .
whenever bond is re-cast the producers and writers say they plan to go back to something closer to the bond which ian fleming wrote in the 50s and 60s .
is that possible ?
wade - personally i really like the books : i came to them from the movies .
the films have this wonderful swoop to them but the books have more texture .
that 's to do with bond being this hard-living , dark creature in the middle of all that 's going on .
purvis - but it 's true that over the years the film character has developed into something quite different to fleming 's character .
though there 's often been talk of going back to basics with bond and making him more ' flemingian ' this was the best opportunity ever because we 're starting again with the first novel .
it was published in 1953 and it 's bond at the beginning of his career .
we still had to satisfy people 's expectations and have a certain amount of humour -that 's one of the biggest differences between the films and the books .
but we tried to be as faithful to the novel as possible and keep it fairly dark .
wade - sadistic !
surely one of the problems with bond has always been he remains essentially the same throughout the movie ?
that can get dull .
purvis - but casino royale gives you the opportunity for a proper arc to his character .
he changes from the beginning to the end .
he 's very young , raw , out of control almost .
wade - what you have with the bond movies is this character gliding over everything .
the fact nothing touches him is why we all want to be him .
but it also makes him a sort of superman who in the end you do n't really relate to .
this time you 'll see someone who gets completely broken down and has to rebuild himself .
he forges the steel of his character through the emotional turmoil he goes through .
so we end up with a character who has a kind of moral compass - and i think from here on you 'll feel bond is denying his own emotions .
so are you trying to lose the 1960s campiness - that slight overlay of the avengers ?
wade - when you have an actor you play to his strengths - and in daniel craig you 've got a fantastic actor .
pierce brosnan had wonderful comic timing - a kind of suavity which you have to celebrate when you 've got it .
with daniel we do n't want him wearing safari suits .

the chain-store 's designs range from traditional china plates and thimbles to a mouse mat and a range of will and kate-shaped pick and mix sweets .
the retailer 's bosses said they wanted to be prepared in case the couple announced they intended to marry .
but a spokesman stressed that the chain had no " inside information " .
some of the early designs consist of pictures of the couple with a gilt edge .

the market for spin-off products from any new royal wedding could be worth £ 10m , according to the retailer .
there has been a steady build-up of speculation that prince william and ms middleton will soon be announcing their engagement .
william hill slashed the odds on an engagement before the end of 2006 to 3-1 in december .
the couple , both aged 24 , met at st andrews university , fife , in 2001 .
