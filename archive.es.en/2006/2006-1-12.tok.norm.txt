program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 12.01.2006 will merkel improve us-german ties ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is visiting washington for the first time as chancellor dw-world readers this week commented on german chancellor angela merkel 's current visit to the united states and the chances for improved trans-atlantic ties .
they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers . " - gstei n er compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears iran stance spells end of negotiations discussions between the eu 's negotiation team and iran over the islamic state 's nuclear program are unlikely to resume , according to the german foreign ministry .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers .

as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .

any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end .

" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .
court action may also be taken against the german rock band rammstein . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second cannibal trial starts in germany a german man who killed his gay lover with a screwdriver , dismembered him and kept some of his organs in the fridge to eat later went on trial in berlin on tuesday .

the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq . " more helpful i n iraq " " many people are thinking of being more helpful in iraq , without sending soldiers , " said karsten voigt , the government 's trans-atlantic specialist .
" of being helpful in other ways . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more training for iraqi police whether that means an expansion of the iraqi police training programs germany is currently running - as reported in germany 's die welt wednesday - or more remains to be seen .
but the token could be the first bit of evidence that merkel 's government is serious about a change in " tone " regarding washington . voigt , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said the new chancellor already has a head start . " she never supported sending troops -lrb- to iraq -rrb- but she was critical of the attitude of schröder , " he said .

previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .

" the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .

that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akbar hashemi rafsanjani accuses the west of colonialism .
he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect . " in beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman voiced china 's " concern " at iran 's move and urged tehran to resume dialogue . us expects security council action ; rice to make statement us diplomats believe they have a majority of votes on the 35-member iaea board to haul iran before the security council , although it was unclear whether enough support could be mustered for eventual sanctions against tehran . the washington post quoted us and european officials saying that russia had pledged not to block efforts to refer iran to the world body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice and the united states have long pushed for un sanctions .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will brief the press thursday on the crisis over iran 's nuclear program after a meeting of washington 's european allies in berlin , officials said . the state department said rice had scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m.
-lrb- 20:00 utc -rrb- after the talks among her " eu-3 " counterparts from germany , france and britain .

" we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akbar hashemi rafsanjani accuses the west of colonialism .
he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect . " in beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman voiced china 's " concern " at iran 's move and urged tehran to resume dialogue . us expects security council action ; rice to make statement us diplomats believe they have a majority of votes on the 35-member iaea board to haul iran before the security council , although it was unclear whether enough support could be mustered for eventual sanctions against tehran . the washington post quoted us and european officials saying that russia had pledged not to block efforts to refer iran to the world body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice and the united states have long pushed for un sanctions .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will brief the press thursday on the crisis over iran 's nuclear program after a meeting of washington 's european allies in berlin , officials said . the state department said rice had scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m.
-lrb- 20:00 utc -rrb- after the talks among her " eu-3 " counterparts from germany , france and britain .

she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .

why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .

i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .

germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .

why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .

but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .

" the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks .

the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq . " more helpful i n iraq " " many people are thinking of being more helpful in iraq , without sending soldiers , " said karsten voigt , the government 's trans-atlantic specialist .
" of being helpful in other ways . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more training for iraqi police whether that means an expansion of the iraqi police training programs germany is currently running - as reported in germany 's die welt wednesday - or more remains to be seen .
but the token could be the first bit of evidence that merkel 's government is serious about a change in " tone " regarding washington . voigt , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said the new chancellor already has a head start . " she never supported sending troops -lrb- to iraq -rrb- but she was critical of the attitude of schröder , " he said .
" this simple fact gives a more positive view , seen from the white house . " a u n ited fro n t o n russia ? the coming months will see what a change in tone could mean in terms of where germany and america 's foreign policy goals intertwine .
the trans-atlantic relationship went through a shake-up following the schröder government 's refusal to send troops to iraq . though experts doubt the relationship under merkel will revert back to the atlanticist days of helmut kohl , the new emphasis on " tone " could lead to a more united front on some issues . evidence of that can be seen as soon as merkel 's planned trip to russia next month .
the german chancellor joins bush in his skepticism of president vladimir putin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united against putin ?
" i think bush has become disaffected with him and merkel already signaled that she will take a more dubious view of him , " said william drozdiak , director of the american council on germany , which will co-host a dinner for merkel in washington on thursday night . drozdiak expects merkel to make an appeal for the preservation of democracy and human rights , increasingly under attack in putin 's russia .
aside from russia , friday 's meeting between the two leaders might also give bush the opportunity to address iran . getti n g germa n y to approve ira n sa n ctio n s the islamic nation 's decision on tuesday to break the internationally monitored seals on at least three of its nuclear facilities , defying the international atomic and energy agency and the european union could fast-track the issue to the un security council , where the united states wants to pass a resolution hanging sanctions . great britain , france and germany , the eu 's three chief negotiators , and the iaea have so far been reluctant to make such a move . " bush will try and persuade her that tehran needs to be brought to heel , " drozdiak said .
" germany would make the biggest sacrifices because they have the strong trading relationship with iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbying to shutter guantanamo bay but the appeals in the white house wo n't be just one way .
merkel 's disapproval of the cia 's use of secret flights to ferry terrorist suspects across europe and her statement sunday that the terrorist suspect holding facility guantanamo bay should eventually be shut down indicates she wo n't back down in asking for something in return . and a glowing first impression this week can only help . " i think she may be able to persuade him to do certain things that schröder was n't able to do , " drozdiak said .
her pitch to close guantanamo bay " is nothing new … but if he hears it from a friendly foreign leader it might make a difference .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .
" not the least bit of doubt should remain , " she said . the head of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , said : " if the current foreign minister knew about this , he could not remain -lrb- in office -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2006 report : german secret agents helped in iraq invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agents reportedly aided in picking out baghdad bomb targets a scandal is brewing in political berlin after two news organizations reported wednesday that german intelligence agents helped the us during military operations in iraq .
germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers . " - gstei n er compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears iran stance spells end of negotiations discussions between the eu 's negotiation team and iran over the islamic state 's nuclear program are unlikely to resume , according to the german foreign ministry .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akbar hashemi rafsanjani accuses the west of colonialism .
he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect . " in beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman voiced china 's " concern " at iran 's move and urged tehran to resume dialogue . us expects security council action ; rice to make statement us diplomats believe they have a majority of votes on the 35-member iaea board to haul iran before the security council , although it was unclear whether enough support could be mustered for eventual sanctions against tehran . the washington post quoted us and european officials saying that russia had pledged not to block efforts to refer iran to the world body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice and the united states have long pushed for un sanctions .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will brief the press thursday on the crisis over iran 's nuclear program after a meeting of washington 's european allies in berlin , officials said . the state department said rice had scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m.
-lrb- 20:00 utc -rrb- after the talks among her " eu-3 " counterparts from germany , france and britain .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .

" he also does n't believe suicide attacks are okay , " rolf grabow said , according to reports . mohammed , 31 , who comes from northern iraq , was arrested in munich in december 2003 . he was the first person to go on trial under a new german law passed in august 2002 allowing the prosecution of members of foreign terrorist organizations .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 12.01.2006 promising washington more smiles and more help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer days ahead under chancellor merkel , berlin wants to strike a more upbeat tone in its relationship with washington , something analysts say that could be very beneficial to the bush administration . iraq , guantanamo bay , russia - the list of issues to cover when chancellor angela merkel and us president george w. bush meet on her first official visit on friday is long . but perhaps more important than talk will be the chemistry between the us leader and merkel , and what it could mean for berlin 's foreign policy in the coming years .
the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq . " more helpful i n iraq " " many people are thinking of being more helpful in iraq , without sending soldiers , " said karsten voigt , the government 's trans-atlantic specialist .
" of being helpful in other ways . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more training for iraqi police whether that means an expansion of the iraqi police training programs germany is currently running - as reported in germany 's die welt wednesday - or more remains to be seen .
but the token could be the first bit of evidence that merkel 's government is serious about a change in " tone " regarding washington . voigt , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said the new chancellor already has a head start . " she never supported sending troops -lrb- to iraq -rrb- but she was critical of the attitude of schröder , " he said .
" this simple fact gives a more positive view , seen from the white house . " a u n ited fro n t o n russia ? the coming months will see what a change in tone could mean in terms of where germany and america 's foreign policy goals intertwine .
the trans-atlantic relationship went through a shake-up following the schröder government 's refusal to send troops to iraq . though experts doubt the relationship under merkel will revert back to the atlanticist days of helmut kohl , the new emphasis on " tone " could lead to a more united front on some issues . evidence of that can be seen as soon as merkel 's planned trip to russia next month .
the german chancellor joins bush in his skepticism of president vladimir putin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united against putin ?
" i think bush has become disaffected with him and merkel already signaled that she will take a more dubious view of him , " said william drozdiak , director of the american council on germany , which will co-host a dinner for merkel in washington on thursday night . drozdiak expects merkel to make an appeal for the preservation of democracy and human rights , increasingly under attack in putin 's russia .
aside from russia , friday 's meeting between the two leaders might also give bush the opportunity to address iran . getti n g germa n y to approve ira n sa n ctio n s the islamic nation 's decision on tuesday to break the internationally monitored seals on at least three of its nuclear facilities , defying the international atomic and energy agency and the european union could fast-track the issue to the un security council , where the united states wants to pass a resolution hanging sanctions . great britain , france and germany , the eu 's three chief negotiators , and the iaea have so far been reluctant to make such a move . " bush will try and persuade her that tehran needs to be brought to heel , " drozdiak said .
" germany would make the biggest sacrifices because they have the strong trading relationship with iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbying to shutter guantanamo bay but the appeals in the white house wo n't be just one way .
merkel 's disapproval of the cia 's use of secret flights to ferry terrorist suspects across europe and her statement sunday that the terrorist suspect holding facility guantanamo bay should eventually be shut down indicates she wo n't back down in asking for something in return . and a glowing first impression this week can only help . " i think she may be able to persuade him to do certain things that schröder was n't able to do , " drozdiak said .
her pitch to close guantanamo bay " is nothing new … but if he hears it from a friendly foreign leader it might make a difference .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .
court action may also be taken against the german rock band rammstein . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second cannibal trial starts in germany a german man who killed his gay lover with a screwdriver , dismembered him and kept some of his organs in the fridge to eat later went on trial in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 12.01.2006 will merkel improve us-german ties ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is visiting washington for the first time as chancellor dw-world readers this week commented on german chancellor angela merkel 's current visit to the united states and the chances for improved trans-atlantic ties .
they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers . " - gstei n er compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears iran stance spells end of negotiations discussions between the eu 's negotiation team and iran over the islamic state 's nuclear program are unlikely to resume , according to the german foreign ministry .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .
" not the least bit of doubt should remain , " she said . the head of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , said : " if the current foreign minister knew about this , he could not remain -lrb- in office -rrb- .

" we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akbar hashemi rafsanjani accuses the west of colonialism .
he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect . " in beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman voiced china 's " concern " at iran 's move and urged tehran to resume dialogue . us expects security council action ; rice to make statement us diplomats believe they have a majority of votes on the 35-member iaea board to haul iran before the security council , although it was unclear whether enough support could be mustered for eventual sanctions against tehran . the washington post quoted us and european officials saying that russia had pledged not to block efforts to refer iran to the world body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice and the united states have long pushed for un sanctions .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will brief the press thursday on the crisis over iran 's nuclear program after a meeting of washington 's european allies in berlin , officials said . the state department said rice had scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m.
-lrb- 20:00 utc -rrb- after the talks among her " eu-3 " counterparts from germany , france and britain .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .
" not the least bit of doubt should remain , " she said . the head of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , said : " if the current foreign minister knew about this , he could not remain -lrb- in office -rrb- .

the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .

one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .

western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it .

he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .

the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .

the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq . " more helpful i n iraq " " many people are thinking of being more helpful in iraq , without sending soldiers , " said karsten voigt , the government 's trans-atlantic specialist .
" of being helpful in other ways . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more training for iraqi police whether that means an expansion of the iraqi police training programs germany is currently running - as reported in germany 's die welt wednesday - or more remains to be seen .
but the token could be the first bit of evidence that merkel 's government is serious about a change in " tone " regarding washington . voigt , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said the new chancellor already has a head start . " she never supported sending troops -lrb- to iraq -rrb- but she was critical of the attitude of schröder , " he said .
" this simple fact gives a more positive view , seen from the white house . " a u n ited fro n t o n russia ? the coming months will see what a change in tone could mean in terms of where germany and america 's foreign policy goals intertwine .
the trans-atlantic relationship went through a shake-up following the schröder government 's refusal to send troops to iraq . though experts doubt the relationship under merkel will revert back to the atlanticist days of helmut kohl , the new emphasis on " tone " could lead to a more united front on some issues . evidence of that can be seen as soon as merkel 's planned trip to russia next month .
the german chancellor joins bush in his skepticism of president vladimir putin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united against putin ?
" i think bush has become disaffected with him and merkel already signaled that she will take a more dubious view of him , " said william drozdiak , director of the american council on germany , which will co-host a dinner for merkel in washington on thursday night . drozdiak expects merkel to make an appeal for the preservation of democracy and human rights , increasingly under attack in putin 's russia .
aside from russia , friday 's meeting between the two leaders might also give bush the opportunity to address iran . getti n g germa n y to approve ira n sa n ctio n s the islamic nation 's decision on tuesday to break the internationally monitored seals on at least three of its nuclear facilities , defying the international atomic and energy agency and the european union could fast-track the issue to the un security council , where the united states wants to pass a resolution hanging sanctions . great britain , france and germany , the eu 's three chief negotiators , and the iaea have so far been reluctant to make such a move . " bush will try and persuade her that tehran needs to be brought to heel , " drozdiak said .
" germany would make the biggest sacrifices because they have the strong trading relationship with iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbying to shutter guantanamo bay but the appeals in the white house wo n't be just one way .
merkel 's disapproval of the cia 's use of secret flights to ferry terrorist suspects across europe and her statement sunday that the terrorist suspect holding facility guantanamo bay should eventually be shut down indicates she wo n't back down in asking for something in return . and a glowing first impression this week can only help . " i think she may be able to persuade him to do certain things that schröder was n't able to do , " drozdiak said .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks . " the resolution to sack the government was supported by an eclectic coalition that included the main parties who opposed yushchenko during last year 's " orange revolution .

" the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology .

western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it .

" speaking at the end of a crisis meeting here after iran resumed sensitive nuclear fuel activities , the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany said they wanted an emergency meeting of the un atomic watchdog to refer the dossier to the world body 's executive . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the troika said in a statement , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said that talks with iran had reached a " dead end . "
" the talks with iran are at a dead end , " germany 's frank-walter steinmeier told reporters at a joint press conference .
" we will be calling for an extraordinary iaea board meeting , " he added . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said a planned meeting with iranian officials on january 18 now " no longer has reason to take place . " iran is not " worried " about its possible referral to the un security council over its nuclear program , a senior nuclear official told state television after the european statement . " we should not be worried , " said abdolreza rahmani fazli , the deputy to ali larijani who is iran 's chief official for the nuclear file .
" it is not what we want , but if that 's the case ... our officials must plan their policy ... to put on a strong show of diplomacy and make our case " in the security council , he said . president says program will continue for iran 's benefit president mahmoud ahmadinejad also appeared on state television to say that iran would press on with its nuclear program to avoid dependency on leading nuclear energy powers who use it as " an economic and political weapon . " " today , those who have the highest level of nuclear energy , have the nuclear fuel in their claws and are using it as an economic and political weapon , " the president told said in a televised speech in the southern hormuzgan province . he continued that " in these circumstances we must master the fuel cycle and the peaceful nuclear technology . " british foreign secretary jack straw had said earlier that it was " highly probable " tehran would end up being referred to the security council , which alone can impose un sanctions . the meeting in berlin was aimed at assessing the international community 's response after iran broke seals at three nuclear facilities in order to resume research into uranium enrichment . breakdown ends two-and-a-half years of diplomacy " for two and a half years we 've been working with iran and the rest of the international community to bring iran into compliance with its very clear obligations not to do anything that leads to suspicions they are developing a nuclear weapons capability , " straw said before the meeting . the meeting came as iran vowed defiance following a furious international response after it broke the seals at the nuclear sites . a diplomat in vienna said iran had now finished removing seals at three nuclear plants , including natanz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed elbaradei will chair the extraordinary session .
iaea director mohamed elbaradei has said iran plans to start " small-scale " uranium enrichment at natanz , although a western diplomat said it would likely take weeks to get the equipment up and running . with international diplomacy in high gear and china and russia adding their criticism of tehran , diplomats in vienna said the iaea could call a meeting of the board of governors within weeks . elbaradei expected to issue " no progress " report on iran the sources said elbaradei would submit a report which , for the first time , would cite " no progress " on the iranian nuclear dossier . " the reason elbaradei has said he is losing patience is not just about the unraveling " of the agreement to suspend enrichment research , but " it is also about inspections , " a western diplomat close to the agency said . separately , britain and russia said officials from the so-called eu-3 plus china , russia and the united states would meet next week in london . apart from germany , the countries to be represented in london are permanent members of the security council , without whose approval un sanctions can not be imposed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will not be dictated to .
western suspicions that iran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons are strongly denied by tehran , whose president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed that he would not be intimidated by the " fuss . " enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations , but in its highly enriched form it makes the explosive core for atomic weapons . iranians defiant over " irreversible " nuclear program " the decision of iran to master nuclear technology is irreversible , god willing , " said foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , cited by the student isna agency . former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a senior cleric and still a key influence in the country , said thursday that nuclear energy was " the desire of our nation , we will pursue it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akbar hashemi rafsanjani accuses the west of colonialism .
he said iran had decided to resume the work and " break the colonial taboos regarding our peaceful nuclear energy -lrb- program -rrb- since the west 's opposition to our peaceful nuclear energy is rooted in their colonial mentality . " in moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said iran 's actions " feed suspicion that this program could have a hidden military aspect . " in beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman voiced china 's " concern " at iran 's move and urged tehran to resume dialogue . us expects security council action ; rice to make statement us diplomats believe they have a majority of votes on the 35-member iaea board to haul iran before the security council , although it was unclear whether enough support could be mustered for eventual sanctions against tehran . the washington post quoted us and european officials saying that russia had pledged not to block efforts to refer iran to the world body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice and the united states have long pushed for un sanctions .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice will brief the press thursday on the crisis over iran 's nuclear program after a meeting of washington 's european allies in berlin , officials said . the state department said rice had scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m.
-lrb- 20:00 utc -rrb- after the talks among her " eu-3 " counterparts from germany , france and britain .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter .

previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .

europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks . " the resolution to sack the government was supported by an eclectic coalition that included the main parties who opposed yushchenko during last year 's " orange revolution .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .
court action may also be taken against the german rock band rammstein . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second cannibal trial starts in germany a german man who killed his gay lover with a screwdriver , dismembered him and kept some of his organs in the fridge to eat later went on trial in berlin on tuesday .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .
court action may also be taken against the german rock band rammstein . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second cannibal trial starts in germany a german man who killed his gay lover with a screwdriver , dismembered him and kept some of his organs in the fridge to eat later went on trial in berlin on tuesday .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .
" not the least bit of doubt should remain , " she said . the head of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , said : " if the current foreign minister knew about this , he could not remain -lrb- in office -rrb- .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement . " the defendant stands accused of murder for sexual gratification , " köhler told the three-judge panel before describing the grisly events of a night in march 2001 . meiwes not insane , experts say the frankfurt court has now begun reviewing the story , the motives and will rewatch the video .
they will listen to testimony again from original witnesses .
and they may also have to examine the man 's psychological state , which was ruled warped but sane at the first trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense says it was assisted suicide legal experts believe that the " cannibal " will be convicted of murder this time around .
that is because during the first trial , there was little applicable law on the books that suited such a unique case . that is not the case this time around because of the higher court ruling .
essentially they ruled that the victim 's consent is irrelevant because the killing was not euthanasia , which carries a sentence of 5 years , but done to get sexual gratification . euthanasia , says the defense the defence will maintain that meiwes performed a kind of euthanasia . " this unprecedented act in german legal history should be judged as killing on demand , " defense attorney joachim bremer said , a crime that is punishable by a maximum five years in prison . " herr brandes insisted on being castrated and killed as soon as he was unconscious , " he said , adding that brandes had refused medical help offered to him after his penis had been " amputated . "
some criminologists think that meiwes should just be placed in preventive custody .
that is because he showed no repentance during the first trial and said he would kill again if he found a willing victim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rammstein sung about the cannibal the case has inspired books , countless chatrooms and even a rock song called " mein teil " by the german rock band rammstein . a movie about the case set for release in germany on march 9 is called " rotenburg . " ermel told reporters that meiwes had not consented to the making of the film .
and he said he will seek an injunction to stop the film because his client resented his portrayal as a " bestial killer " and because it may be prejudicial .

the higher court ruled that the original trial had ignored that the video was made to satisfy the defendant 's sexual desires . meiwes , a computer expert and former army officer admitted to killing a berlin man and fellow computer specialist bernd-jürgen brandes , 42 .
he was given the more lenient sentence of manslaughter because brandes had requested he be eaten .
the men them met near meiwes ' home in rotenburg in central germany . cheerful demeanor meiwes , wearing a dark suit and a black dress shirt and looking thinner than when he was first convicted , was led into the courtroom in handcuffs . he greeted his three-member legal team with a broad smile and handshakes , cheerfully answered basic questions from the judge , then listened impassively as state prosecutor marcus köhler made his opening statement .

they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . merkel , guantanamo and trans-atlantic ties i would like to thank the chancellor for her courage in expressing what european leaders should have expressed a long time ago .
she alone came out for principles europeans say they hold dear .
in fact , she is doing us americans a favor because she is upholding the principles which made america great -lrb- even while we ourselves neglect them -rrb- .
right on , chancellor !
as a woman , i am especially proud that it took a woman to tell our president bush that you do not teach about human rights to the arab world by disrespecting human rights under the pretext of fighting terrorism . - orayb najjar , us i believe that chancellor merkel should be strengthening european ties , and making it clear that europe does not consider that us neo-con values are supreme .
that " old europe " has social and political alternatives to offer the world that will balance the us claim to domination , and help smaller countries maintain their cultural identities . - norm ryder i find the remarks of chancellor merkel about the us terrorist prison camp at guantanamo cuba to be ironic .
but then germany has much more experience running prison camps : auschwitz , birkenau , belzec , chelmno , majdanek , sobibor , and treblinka .
in the future perhaps chancellor merkel could read a history book before making embarrassing comments .
maybe her soviet history books did not cover that unhappy part of the german role in world war ii .
the us has had to deal with former hamburg residents who crashed planes on 9/11 .
maybe germany could be more careful who they allow to immigrate . - joh n ki n g angela merkel will play a key role in repairing transatlantic ties .
her strength will come from very decisive , methodical , forthright communication .
her weakness would be vacillation , and " wishy-washiness . "
right now , germany ca n't afford being " wishy-washy . " .
i think it is vital merkel stands with the eu more than the us or russia .
any country viewed as aggressive or belligerent will not be tolerated by the common humanity with common decency and the right of freedom . - sta n leo n ard calgary , ca n ada merkel will be successful .
why ?
first , the us needs friends , and after criticism of european countries -lrb- mainly germany and france -rrb- in buildup to the war in iraq , she will seek to repair those friendships ; washington has little cause for arrogance and great need for support , even if only vocal and atmospheric .
secondly , she is a lady ; she will be less feisty and haughty than -lrb- former chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder , whom us officials did n't like . - jssrt chancellor merkel 's track record would have been well known in the usa by now - her prowess as a mediator in the eu ; her new year speech that galvanized people 's hopes and aspirations .
she is the daughter of a christian pastor and inherited the christian faith like george bush .
she is conservative in her policies like george bush .
ms. merkel will - i am sure - get a very warm welcome in spite of her guantanamo opposition . - r033121 the chancellor will not be welcome in this country - not on thursday especially , because of the ongoing alito hearings .
she will receive virtually no media attention .
germany has done its best to undermine the us in recent years .
germany should improve its economic situation , primarily the unemployment crisis , by following the lead of the us and not be critical of our leaders or policies . - dvdbls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said guantanamo prison camp has to be dissolved perhaps merkel would like the us to transfer the guantanamo prisoners to germany ?
i 'm sure president bush would seriously consider it , especially if merkel guarantees they 'll stay in germany .
i 'm sure some of the residents in hamburg would welcome them . - jatherto n if ms. merkel were an american , she would not have been entrusted with such power ; therefore no , i do n't think anything she has to say will be taken seriously by an american good old boy . - dolli n ky as a proud american of german descent i was hoping merkel would leave behind the weak and cowering ways of herr schröder .
germany used to be a proud and strong nation willing to fight , albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons .
now germany is little better then cowards in france seeing moral equivalence between the us which saved europe not once but twice and the murderous butchers of the islamic extremists .
i am angered and saddened by merkel 's appeasement . - jb24esq ira n 's n uclear ambitio n s i think that the europeans should accept iran 's objective guarantees about enriching uranium on its own soil and even deign to flatter iran on its right to do so : at present , their insistence that iran refrain form exercising her rights makes the whole issue far too politicized and plays into tehran 's hands : they should , rather , ask iran to accept limitations and more monitoring of its program but step back from asking them to desist from enrichment entirely . - joseph ha n n o n i most definitely think iran 's resumption of nuclear research is dangerous .
i think we all know khamenei 's hidden agenda behind the nuclear program .
all nations need to respond to iran now before it 's too late and then we end up with another sad situation like iraq . - cathy mcke n n ey , us iran should be taken to the un security council .
they should not be allowed to enrich uranium , and they have thrown down the gauntlet .
if we do not act now they will go further and further past the point of no return . - amorri i find this editorial well below your normal effort .
it is as if you want to say something but do n't know just what .
so you settled for the well tested doctrine of moral equivalency .
iran and europe are both to blame .
we all know liberal types have a problem defining evil and most believe it does not really exist .
as to the success of sanctions , look at libya , rhodesia , south africa .
remember cassandra 's predictions were correct - her curse was not to be believed . - petraro n ish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrations in berlin this editorial is one-sided .
anyone who has lived in iran or followed the philosophy and actions of the ruling elite in iran knows that they are after nuclear weapons and for what reason .
read history .
chauvinism and upmanship are the disease of the culture .
i have worked in the upper echelons of the iranian government and know what the goals of the ruling elite is .
your editorial provides them the food to justify what they are doing .
you do not mention the 20-plus years of deception that the iranian government practiced over everything , including its nuclear program .
you do not look at the cruel nature of its policies , and you do not address what iran is very likely to do when it does acquire nuclear weapons . - n azarih the iranians must be sharply worried .
the germans are moving though the range : concerned , very concerned , critical , sharply critical , extremely critical .
let me suggest some more frightening words .
sharply consternated , worriedly exasperated , seriously disconcerted , angrily enervated .
there are more if you are interested .
and the germans want a security council seat ?
germany does n't even rate a rating of paper tiger .
how about the " mouse that wimpers . " - gstei n er compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears iran stance spells end of negotiations discussions between the eu 's negotiation team and iran over the islamic state 's nuclear program are unlikely to resume , according to the german foreign ministry .

the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq . " more helpful i n iraq " " many people are thinking of being more helpful in iraq , without sending soldiers , " said karsten voigt , the government 's trans-atlantic specialist .
" of being helpful in other ways . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more training for iraqi police whether that means an expansion of the iraqi police training programs germany is currently running - as reported in germany 's die welt wednesday - or more remains to be seen .
but the token could be the first bit of evidence that merkel 's government is serious about a change in " tone " regarding washington . voigt , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said the new chancellor already has a head start . " she never supported sending troops -lrb- to iraq -rrb- but she was critical of the attitude of schröder , " he said .
" this simple fact gives a more positive view , seen from the white house . " a u n ited fro n t o n russia ? the coming months will see what a change in tone could mean in terms of where germany and america 's foreign policy goals intertwine .
the trans-atlantic relationship went through a shake-up following the schröder government 's refusal to send troops to iraq . though experts doubt the relationship under merkel will revert back to the atlanticist days of helmut kohl , the new emphasis on " tone " could lead to a more united front on some issues . evidence of that can be seen as soon as merkel 's planned trip to russia next month .
the german chancellor joins bush in his skepticism of president vladimir putin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united against putin ?
" i think bush has become disaffected with him and merkel already signaled that she will take a more dubious view of him , " said william drozdiak , director of the american council on germany , which will co-host a dinner for merkel in washington on thursday night . drozdiak expects merkel to make an appeal for the preservation of democracy and human rights , increasingly under attack in putin 's russia .
aside from russia , friday 's meeting between the two leaders might also give bush the opportunity to address iran . getti n g germa n y to approve ira n sa n ctio n s the islamic nation 's decision on tuesday to break the internationally monitored seals on at least three of its nuclear facilities , defying the international atomic and energy agency and the european union could fast-track the issue to the un security council , where the united states wants to pass a resolution hanging sanctions . great britain , france and germany , the eu 's three chief negotiators , and the iaea have so far been reluctant to make such a move . " bush will try and persuade her that tehran needs to be brought to heel , " drozdiak said .
" germany would make the biggest sacrifices because they have the strong trading relationship with iran . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbying to shutter guantanamo bay but the appeals in the white house wo n't be just one way .
merkel 's disapproval of the cia 's use of secret flights to ferry terrorist suspects across europe and her statement sunday that the terrorist suspect holding facility guantanamo bay should eventually be shut down indicates she wo n't back down in asking for something in return . and a glowing first impression this week can only help .

the bad blood between bush and merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was an open secret and reports indicate that merkel will do everything in her power to set a new tone , including offering more in iraq .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .
" this decision means only one thing : the destabilization of the situation -lrb- in ukraine -rrb- . on tuesday , lawmakers passed a resolution of no-confidence in prime minister yury yekhanurov 's government , chiefly motivated by the deal . most analysts and many politicians in kiev said the gas deal was only an excuse for the opposition to strike a blow against pro-yushchenko forces ahead of a march 26 parliamentary election , which will decide the future of the pro-western course that the president has set for ex-soviet ukraine . olexander dergachyov , the editor of a political magazine in kiev , said that " any deal would have made the government the object of attacks .

ukraine will respect agreements made with russia and europe to the letter . " the two leaders were in kazakhstan for the inauguration of veteran kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . the chairman of russian energy giant gazprom , aleksei miller , and russian energy minister viktor khristenko , as well as ukrainian energy minister ivan plachkov and the head of ukraine 's state-owned energy company naftogaz , oleksiy ivchenko , also attended the ceremony . a face-saving agreement the crisis came to a head on new year 's day when russia briefly shut off gas supplies after ukraine refused a four-fold price increase , causing disruption in gas deliveries to other countries in europe further downstream .
europe receives nearly one-fifth of its annual gas imports from russia via ukraine . the two sides signed a face-saving agreement on january 4 which resulted in a near doubling of gas prices for ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face-saving deals doubles the price of gas for ukraine under the accord , ukraine agreed to buy natural gas from russia and turkmenistan , which accounts for nearly 75 percent of its annual energy needs , at a price of $ 95 -lrb- 79 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters .
previously it bought russian gas under a barter system for 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters , and turkmen gas for between $ 44 and $ 60 per 1,000 cubic meters . the price reached under the accord was well below the 230 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters that russia had been demanding .
but the complex accord sets the price of 95 dollars only for the first six months of 2006 , with the later price to be set by an as yet undetermined formula . repercussions for ukraine the agreement was sharply criticized by various political groups in kiev and on tuesday the parliament voted to sack the government over the accord . yushchenko warned wednesday that the sacking of his pro-western government by lawmakers over a controversial gas deal with russia would destabilize the country less than three months before a key parliamentary election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal had repercussions for the ukrainian prime minister " this decision is incomprehensible and illegitimate , " yushchenko told reporters in kazakhstan .

germany 's foreign minister denied the reports . in a front page story in the respected süddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- , renowned investigative journalist hans leyendecker and colleague wolfgang krach quoted a high-ranking german security source as saying that two federal intelligence agency agents -lrb- bnd -rrb- in baghdad helped the us military assess targets during the air invasion of iraq in the war 's opening weeks . the office of chancellor gerhard schröder , who thrust us-german relations into an ice age through his disapproval of the iraq invasion , reportedly knew about the cooperation and approved of it , according to the article .
the cooperation was made after a " political decision " by schröder 's coalition government .
" this was n't the decision of some department head , " the sz quoted their source as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder opposed the war , but reportedly approved intelligence cooperation current foreign minister denies report the report was indirectly confirmed by a former us defense official in the german television program " panorama . "
whereas the article in the sz said the agents were involved in reporting targets on the ground that should n't be attacked , the us defense official claimed the agents did much more . the bnd gave " direct support " in " selecting targets " , said the official .
one example of that support : a bnd agent drove to the baghdad district mansur in an armored limousine in order to confirm us suspicions that a caravan of cars carrying iraqi officials , including saddam hussein , was driving through the area .
the information he relayed on april 7 , 2003 , was reportedly used in an immediate bomb attack on a complex of buildings in which at least 12 people died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help in picking out saddam as a bomb target franz-walter steinmeier , the german foreign minister who was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the invasion , confirmed thursday that bnd agents were in baghdad during the invasion , but denied they provided target advice . the sz reported that a bnd agent received high honors from the us military for his help . opposition demands investigation the bnd disputed the report , saying that the office only " gathered , evaluated and reported information to the federal government , within the framework of their federal mandate . "
the agency chiefly reported information on the war 's progress and its consequences , said the bnd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth has called for a full investigation reaction to the reports has been highly critical .
the head of the free-market liberals , guido westerwelle , said they were " very grave accusations . " the domestic affairs spokesman for his party , the free democrats , said that should the report prove true it would be a " definite scandal needing an urgent and comprehensive explanation . " the green party , at the time schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government , also demanded an explanation .
" that would be a blatant infringement on the german ' no ' to the iraq war , " party chief claudia roth told wire agency dpa .
she also demanded a comprehensive parliamentary investigation .
" not the least bit of doubt should remain , " she said . the head of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , said : " if the current foreign minister knew about this , he could not remain -lrb- in office -rrb- .

the three victims were ambushed and shot dead near the us-owned freeport gold mine where they worked .
local police said they suspected that all 12 detainees were members of the separatist free papua movement .
human rights groups have consistently said they suspected that the indonesian military was involved in the killings .
but they say that such allegations have never been properly followed up .
local police say further questioning is needed to determine how many of the 12 detainees may have had a role in the killing of the schoolteachers .
they have confirmed , however , that antonious wamang , who was indicted by a united states grand jury in 2004 following a lengthy fbi investigation , is among those being held .
beyond that , much is still unclear .
for instance , what prompted the police to act now , four years after the incident and two years after the us indictment ?
speaking to local radio , the police chief in papua referred only to what he called " old evidence " , such as fingerprints found at the crime scene .

the three victims were ambushed and shot dead near the us-owned freeport gold mine where they worked .
local police said they suspected that all 12 detainees were members of the separatist free papua movement .
human rights groups have consistently said they suspected that the indonesian military was involved in the killings .
but they say that such allegations have never been properly followed up .
local police say further questioning is needed to determine how many of the 12 detainees may have had a role in the killing of the schoolteachers .
they have confirmed , however , that antonious wamang , who was indicted by a united states grand jury in 2004 following a lengthy fbi investigation , is among those being held .

the settlement was negotiated following legal action over controversial copy protection technology .
the virus-like techniques used by the anti-copying system led to a lot of bad publicity for the music maker in 2005 .
however , still pending are legal cases mounted by several us states over sony bmg 's anti-piracy technology .
big deal the row blew up in early november following the discovery that sony bmg was protecting some of its cds using a system called xcp .
when played on pcs , this software installed a proprietary media player and hid itself deep inside the windows operating system .
following reports that virus writers were starting to use this ability to hide their malicious creations , many consumers took legal action over the software .
other consumers took action over cds that were being protected with a technology known as mediamax .
the consumer lawsuits were all rolled together and a tentative deal to settle them all was reached shortly after christmas .
now following a hearing us district judge naomi reice buchwald has given tentative approval to the terms of the deal .
the deal involves sony bmg giving cash refunds and downloads to consumers who bought cds that used the xcp technology .
consumers can forgo the cash and get more downloads .
those who own cds protected by mediamax will only get downloads as part of the deal .
the settlement also requires sony bmg to stop using xcp and mediamax .
the music firm is already recalling all xcp-using cds but so far has said nothing about swapping mediamax-using discs .
the xcp technology was used on 52 releases and mediamax on 27 .
sony bmg has also pledged to produce tools that make it easy to uninstall all traces of the xcp software .

the settlement was negotiated following legal action over controversial copy protection technology .
the virus-like techniques used by the anti-copying system led to a lot of bad publicity for the music maker in 2005 .
however , still pending are legal cases mounted by several us states over sony bmg 's anti-piracy technology .
big deal the row blew up in early november following the discovery that sony bmg was protecting some of its cds using a system called xcp .
when played on pcs , this software installed a proprietary media player and hid itself deep inside the windows operating system .
following reports that virus writers were starting to use this ability to hide their malicious creations , many consumers took legal action over the software .
other consumers took action over cds that were being protected with a technology known as mediamax .
the consumer lawsuits were all rolled together and a tentative deal to settle them all was reached shortly after christmas .
now following a hearing us district judge naomi reice buchwald has given tentative approval to the terms of the deal .
the deal involves sony bmg giving cash refunds and downloads to consumers who bought cds that used the xcp technology .
consumers can forgo the cash and get more downloads .
those who own cds protected by mediamax will only get downloads as part of the deal .
the settlement also requires sony bmg to stop using xcp and mediamax .
the music firm is already recalling all xcp-using cds but so far has said nothing about swapping mediamax-using discs .
the xcp technology was used on 52 releases and mediamax on 27 .
sony bmg has also pledged to produce tools that make it easy to uninstall all traces of the xcp software .

following reports that virus writers were starting to use this ability to hide their malicious creations , many consumers took legal action over the software .
other consumers took action over cds that were being protected with a technology known as mediamax .
the consumer lawsuits were all rolled together and a tentative deal to settle them all was reached shortly after christmas .
now following a hearing us district judge naomi reice buchwald has given tentative approval to the terms of the deal .
the deal involves sony bmg giving cash refunds and downloads to consumers who bought cds that used the xcp technology .
consumers can forgo the cash and get more downloads .
those who own cds protected by mediamax will only get downloads as part of the deal .
the settlement also requires sony bmg to stop using xcp and mediamax .
the music firm is already recalling all xcp-using cds but so far has said nothing about swapping mediamax-using discs .
the xcp technology was used on 52 releases and mediamax on 27 .
sony bmg has also pledged to produce tools that make it easy to uninstall all traces of the xcp software .

washington is excited about angela merkel 's visit that was a low key affair for a little valued relationship .
mr schroeder , who had used his attacks on president george w bush to bolster his flagging support back home , was allowed a brief photo opportunity with the president in the white house .
he had spent hours in the air for a few minutes in front of the cameras .
not even a glimpse of a red carpet .
this time washington is actually excited about the new german chancellor 's visit .
a straight talker angela merkel came to power late last year promising to revitalise her country 's tattered relations with the us - and the bush administration took note .
she 's an east german who grew up on the wrong side of the iron curtain - but still embraced so many of the values that america loves she may be representing " old europe " but she is opening a new chapter in the two countries ' ties .
germany 's ambassador to washington , wolfgang ischinger , told me he has been unable to meet the demand for dinner with the new german chancellor at the embassy on thursday night - such is her popularity on capitol hill .
it 's not just because she is not schroeder .
her past resonates here with this administration .
she is an east german who grew up on the wrong side of the iron curtain , but still embraced so many of the values that america loves - freedom and the free market .
there was little love lost between the us president and mr schroeder her style is also appreciated .
she is a straight talker - but not confrontational .
she is prepared to raise disagreements with washington - but will always do so in the context that germany values its friendship with america .
do not expect any lectures on iraq .
do expect strong support for the us in its efforts to confront iran over its nuclear programme .
differences remain the white house is also eager to repair transatlantic relations .
hence president bush 's decision to visit europe at the start of his second term last year .
secretary of state condoleezza rice flew to berlin soon after mrs merkel 's appointment .
but that visit also highlighted potential strains : america 's treatment of terrorist suspects .
it is the one issue that that could upset the honeymoon couple .
the us treatment of terror suspects could be a fly in the ointment with one eye on her domestic audience , mrs merkel gave an interview to der spiegel magazine before leaving for washington .
when asked about the us treatment of detainees she said : " an institution like guantanamo bay should not exist in the longer term ...
different ways and means must be found for dealing with these prisoners . "
it is the issue that has already strained europe and the us - and will continue to do so .
the german ambassador to washington told me transatlantic relations would be significantly eased if in the medium or long term " other ways " could be found to deal with detainees .
and no , renditions and cia secret prisons are not the answer .
but note that mrs merkel talked about resolving this issue " in the longer term " .
washington will welcome the breathing space .

when antony and the johnsons won the mercury music prize for uk album of the year , some in the music industry and media said us-based singer antony hegarty should not have qualified for a british prize .
now the uk-born singer , who has lived in the us for more than 20 years , has been nominated for the best british male solo artist prize at the brit awards .
the androgynous frontman predicted the reaction - half of the public would think he was not british , he joked , and the other half would think he was not male .
he may not have considered a few others who might think he is not solo .
hegarty is one of several brits inclusions and omissions who are raising eyebrows among music fans .
award rules say entrants for the british categories " must be uk passport holders or of dual nationality and resident in the uk " .
hegarty is a british passport holder but lives in new york .
the rule is ambiguous but organisers say it does not mean nominees for british awards must live in the uk - only those with dual nationality .
and is he solo ?
he plays with a band and there are six other members of the johnsons - but it is mainly his project .
record labels and managers decide which categories to enter their artists for , organisers say - so that is why he is up for a solo award .
in other categories , a string of albums are nominated despite being released more than 12 months ago .
the awards are not just for records released during 2005 - albums released between 2 august 2004 and 28 november 2005 are eligible .
this 16-month period is designed to catch " sleeper " albums that were released months before an artist hit the big time .
this theory worked with james blunt 's back to bedlam , which was released in october 2004 .
it did not gain popularity in time for last year 's ceremony , so now has the chance to win thanks to the extended qualifying period .
but u2 's how to dismantle an atomic bomb - released in november 2004 - came out during the crossover period and so has been nominated for two years in a row .
another contender for best international album is green day 's american idiot - which was not a " sleeper " release when it came out in september 2004 .
despite being eligible last year , it was not nominated .
but this year , it has made the list .
most nominees are chosen by a vote of 1,000 music industry figures - ranging from record company executives and music critics to concert promoters and djs .
but the best british single shortlist is based on airplay and sales - which means x factor winner shayne ward is nominated but gorillaz are not .
and the nominees for best pop act are " based on sales of albums and singles over a calendar year " .
under these rules , kelly clarkson and katie melua - who have had strong album sales but no massive hit singles - are in the running .
but mcfly -lrb- two number one singles in 2005 -rrb- , sugababes -lrb- one chart-topper -rrb- and girls aloud -lrb- four top 10 hits -rrb- are not .
there has also been reported disquiet about the best british live act category .
past controversy media stories have said live 8 acts - such as show-stealers pink floyd and robbie williams - have been excluded because it was a free event .
but the brits awards would not be the brits without a bit of controversy and such arguments are nothing new .
last year 's victory for joss stone in the urban category sparked a debate about who should qualify for that award .
four years ago , dido was dropped from the best newcomer category because she had already been nominated for best british female the previous year .
and in 2000 , king of my castle by wamdue project was dropped from the best british single category as none of the artists had a british passport .
