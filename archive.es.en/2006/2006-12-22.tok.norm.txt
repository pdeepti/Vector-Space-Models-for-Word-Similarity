the most common destination is sweden , which grants residency permits more easily than other countries , such as germany . iraqis top the list of 40 nationalities seeking asylum in europe , with more than 8,100 applicants during the first six months of 2006 - a 50-percent increase compared with the same period a year ago . refugees are coming to europe in increasing numbers because of the " deteriorating situation in iraq which is on the brink of a civil war , " astrid van genderen stort , a spokeswoman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , told the afp news agency . countries near iraq have even higher numbers of refugees .
there were more than 700,000 iraqi refugees in jordan , at least 600,000 in syria and 100,000 in egypt , according to the unhcr . sweden most popular destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sectarian fighing has made life in iraq increasingly difficult sweden remains the top european destination because of its generous refugee policies and because many iraqis are already there , having emigrated there in the 1990s . approximately 79,200 iraqis now call sweden home , making them the second-largest immigrant group after finns .
iraqi asylum seekers are of all religious and ethnic backgrounds , van genderen stort said . " sweden has the reputation of being a humane country , a safe and democratic country that respects human rights , " said hikmet hussain , the head of the iraqi federation in sweden . in sweden , refugees can easily get residency permits .
some 80 to 90 percent of requests have been approved since january , afp reported . rest of europe less welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhannad yousif while most european countries do n't deport iraqis , many let them stay but deny them residency permits .
in switzerland , the primarily iraqi kurdish refugees are offered accommodation in a refugee center and are allowed to stay temporarily , said dominique boillat , a spokeswoman for the swiss immigration authority . " they know we wo n't send them back , " boillat said . in germany , where 1,918 iraqis sought asylum in the first 11 months of 2006 , only 1 to 2 percent are accepted , according to the government . in denmark , a staunch ally of the united states in the iraq war , 80 percent of the 650 iraqi asylum seekers are in the process of being deported . krister isaksson , an analyst at the swedish migration board , said the numbers of iraqis in some european countries might be higher .
but many choose to remain illegal because they believe their asylum request will be denied . " this is how sweden is different , " isaksson said .
" in sweden , they opt to seek asylum because they are likely to get permission to stay . " isaksson said she does n't expect the number of iraqi asylum seekers to decrease in the near future . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on germany to respect christian asylum seekers pope benedict xvi has called on germanyy to respect the rights of refugees , particularly those of christians .

" it is not a political decision ; it should be decided at the military level , " von klaeden told the friday edition of the daily neue presse in hanover . but the junior state secretary for defense , thomas kossendy - who is also a conservative member - was quoted by friday 's nordwest-zeitung as saying that " such decisions should n't be made without parliament . " nato wants reinforcements in the south nato has asked germany to send five or six tornado reconnaissance planes for use across the whole of afghanistan .
this means the additional 250 german troops which would be sent with the planes could find themselves deployed in the south of the country where fighting against the taliban is fiercest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops could be deployed in other areas of afghanistan under the existing mandate , which parliament renewed for one year in september , germany 's 2,700 soldiers are based in the relatively stable north of afghanistan . the mandate only allows for troop deployment to other parts of afghanistan if it is an emergency situation and if " operations are limited as to their duration and scope . " greens furious the head of germany 's opposition green party , reinhard bütikofer , accused the coalition government of conservatives and social democrats of withholding vital information about the deployment , and criticized foreign minister frank josef jung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defence minister franz josef jung has been pressured by nato to increase germany 's mandate " it is extremely annoying that foreign minister jung always acts before giving parliament enough information , " bütikofer told zdf television on friday . " if it is a grey area , then it is better to get a new parliamentary mandate because it is a parliamentary army , " bütikofer said . " it should n't be possible for the government to go through the back door and bypass parliament in order to mobilize soldiers . " the head of the green parliamentary group , hans-christian ströbele went one step further .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau , he said he would take the matter to germany 's constitutional court if the government sent the planes without a new mandate . foreign minister jung said on thursday the government would make its final decision in january about whether to deploy the spy planes . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany prepared to send spy planes to afghanistan germany is " prepared in principle " to send tornado reconnaissance planes to afghanistan in response to a request from nato but a decision has not been made , a deputy foreign minister said on thursday .

" it is not a political decision ; it should be decided at the military level , " von klaeden told the friday edition of the daily neue presse in hanover . but the junior state secretary for defense , thomas kossendy - who is also a conservative member - was quoted by friday 's nordwest-zeitung as saying that " such decisions should n't be made without parliament . " nato wants reinforcements in the south nato has asked germany to send five or six tornado reconnaissance planes for use across the whole of afghanistan .
this means the additional 250 german troops which would be sent with the planes could find themselves deployed in the south of the country where fighting against the taliban is fiercest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops could be deployed in other areas of afghanistan under the existing mandate , which parliament renewed for one year in september , germany 's 2,700 soldiers are based in the relatively stable north of afghanistan . the mandate only allows for troop deployment to other parts of afghanistan if it is an emergency situation and if " operations are limited as to their duration and scope . " greens furious the head of germany 's opposition green party , reinhard bütikofer , accused the coalition government of conservatives and social democrats of withholding vital information about the deployment , and criticized foreign minister frank josef jung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defence minister franz josef jung has been pressured by nato to increase germany 's mandate " it is extremely annoying that foreign minister jung always acts before giving parliament enough information , " bütikofer told zdf television on friday .

11 highjackers has appealed his conviction to germany 's highest court .
the appeal wo n't delay mounir el motassadeq 's sentencing , scheduled for january . last year , 32-year-old motassadeq was sentenced to seven years in jail for belonging to a terrorist group .
motassadeq , a moroccan living in hamburg , was part of a circle that included mohamed atta and two other highjackers that carried out the 2001 suicide attacks in the new york and washington which killed more than 3,000 people . in november , motassadeq was convicted of being an accessory to murder .
the court directed a fresh sentencing .
the additional charge could double motassadeq 's jail term . sentencing going forward despite appeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq was convicted for his role in the sept .

the constitutional complaint does not suspend that , " appellate court spokeswoman sabine westphalen told the dpa news agency on friday . that hearing is scheduled for jan .

" it is not a political decision ; it should be decided at the military level , " von klaeden told the friday edition of the daily neue presse in hanover . but the junior state secretary for defense , thomas kossendy - who is also a conservative member - was quoted by friday 's nordwest-zeitung as saying that " such decisions should n't be made without parliament . " nato wants reinforcements in the south nato has asked germany to send five or six tornado reconnaissance planes for use across the whole of afghanistan .
this means the additional 250 german troops which would be sent with the planes could find themselves deployed in the south of the country where fighting against the taliban is fiercest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops could be deployed in other areas of afghanistan under the existing mandate , which parliament renewed for one year in september , germany 's 2,700 soldiers are based in the relatively stable north of afghanistan . the mandate only allows for troop deployment to other parts of afghanistan if it is an emergency situation and if " operations are limited as to their duration and scope . " greens furious the head of germany 's opposition green party , reinhard bütikofer , accused the coalition government of conservatives and social democrats of withholding vital information about the deployment , and criticized foreign minister frank josef jung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defence minister franz josef jung has been pressured by nato to increase germany 's mandate " it is extremely annoying that foreign minister jung always acts before giving parliament enough information , " bütikofer told zdf television on friday . " if it is a grey area , then it is better to get a new parliamentary mandate because it is a parliamentary army , " bütikofer said . " it should n't be possible for the government to go through the back door and bypass parliament in order to mobilize soldiers . " the head of the green parliamentary group , hans-christian ströbele went one step further .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau , he said he would take the matter to germany 's constitutional court if the government sent the planes without a new mandate . foreign minister jung said on thursday the government would make its final decision in january about whether to deploy the spy planes . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany prepared to send spy planes to afghanistan germany is " prepared in principle " to send tornado reconnaissance planes to afghanistan in response to a request from nato but a decision has not been made , a deputy foreign minister said on thursday .

there were more than 700,000 iraqi refugees in jordan , at least 600,000 in syria and 100,000 in egypt , according to the unhcr . sweden most popular destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sectarian fighing has made life in iraq increasingly difficult sweden remains the top european destination because of its generous refugee policies and because many iraqis are already there , having emigrated there in the 1990s . approximately 79,200 iraqis now call sweden home , making them the second-largest immigrant group after finns .
iraqi asylum seekers are of all religious and ethnic backgrounds , van genderen stort said .

but many choose to remain illegal because they believe their asylum request will be denied . " this is how sweden is different , " isaksson said .
" in sweden , they opt to seek asylum because they are likely to get permission to stay .

the most common destination is sweden , which grants residency permits more easily than other countries , such as germany . iraqis top the list of 40 nationalities seeking asylum in europe , with more than 8,100 applicants during the first six months of 2006 - a 50-percent increase compared with the same period a year ago . refugees are coming to europe in increasing numbers because of the " deteriorating situation in iraq which is on the brink of a civil war , " astrid van genderen stort , a spokeswoman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , told the afp news agency . countries near iraq have even higher numbers of refugees .
there were more than 700,000 iraqi refugees in jordan , at least 600,000 in syria and 100,000 in egypt , according to the unhcr . sweden most popular destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sectarian fighing has made life in iraq increasingly difficult sweden remains the top european destination because of its generous refugee policies and because many iraqis are already there , having emigrated there in the 1990s . approximately 79,200 iraqis now call sweden home , making them the second-largest immigrant group after finns .
iraqi asylum seekers are of all religious and ethnic backgrounds , van genderen stort said . " sweden has the reputation of being a humane country , a safe and democratic country that respects human rights , " said hikmet hussain , the head of the iraqi federation in sweden . in sweden , refugees can easily get residency permits .
some 80 to 90 percent of requests have been approved since january , afp reported . rest of europe less welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhannad yousif while most european countries do n't deport iraqis , many let them stay but deny them residency permits .
in switzerland , the primarily iraqi kurdish refugees are offered accommodation in a refugee center and are allowed to stay temporarily , said dominique boillat , a spokeswoman for the swiss immigration authority . " they know we wo n't send them back , " boillat said . in germany , where 1,918 iraqis sought asylum in the first 11 months of 2006 , only 1 to 2 percent are accepted , according to the government . in denmark , a staunch ally of the united states in the iraq war , 80 percent of the 650 iraqi asylum seekers are in the process of being deported . krister isaksson , an analyst at the swedish migration board , said the numbers of iraqis in some european countries might be higher .
but many choose to remain illegal because they believe their asylum request will be denied . " this is how sweden is different , " isaksson said .
" in sweden , they opt to seek asylum because they are likely to get permission to stay .

the most common destination is sweden , which grants residency permits more easily than other countries , such as germany . iraqis top the list of 40 nationalities seeking asylum in europe , with more than 8,100 applicants during the first six months of 2006 - a 50-percent increase compared with the same period a year ago . refugees are coming to europe in increasing numbers because of the " deteriorating situation in iraq which is on the brink of a civil war , " astrid van genderen stort , a spokeswoman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , told the afp news agency . countries near iraq have even higher numbers of refugees .
there were more than 700,000 iraqi refugees in jordan , at least 600,000 in syria and 100,000 in egypt , according to the unhcr . sweden most popular destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sectarian fighing has made life in iraq increasingly difficult sweden remains the top european destination because of its generous refugee policies and because many iraqis are already there , having emigrated there in the 1990s . approximately 79,200 iraqis now call sweden home , making them the second-largest immigrant group after finns .
iraqi asylum seekers are of all religious and ethnic backgrounds , van genderen stort said . " sweden has the reputation of being a humane country , a safe and democratic country that respects human rights , " said hikmet hussain , the head of the iraqi federation in sweden . in sweden , refugees can easily get residency permits .
some 80 to 90 percent of requests have been approved since january , afp reported . rest of europe less welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhannad yousif while most european countries do n't deport iraqis , many let them stay but deny them residency permits .
in switzerland , the primarily iraqi kurdish refugees are offered accommodation in a refugee center and are allowed to stay temporarily , said dominique boillat , a spokeswoman for the swiss immigration authority . " they know we wo n't send them back , " boillat said . in germany , where 1,918 iraqis sought asylum in the first 11 months of 2006 , only 1 to 2 percent are accepted , according to the government . in denmark , a staunch ally of the united states in the iraq war , 80 percent of the 650 iraqi asylum seekers are in the process of being deported . krister isaksson , an analyst at the swedish migration board , said the numbers of iraqis in some european countries might be higher .
but many choose to remain illegal because they believe their asylum request will be denied . " this is how sweden is different , " isaksson said .
" in sweden , they opt to seek asylum because they are likely to get permission to stay . " isaksson said she does n't expect the number of iraqi asylum seekers to decrease in the near future . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on germany to respect christian asylum seekers pope benedict xvi has called on germanyy to respect the rights of refugees , particularly those of christians .

the most common destination is sweden , which grants residency permits more easily than other countries , such as germany . iraqis top the list of 40 nationalities seeking asylum in europe , with more than 8,100 applicants during the first six months of 2006 - a 50-percent increase compared with the same period a year ago . refugees are coming to europe in increasing numbers because of the " deteriorating situation in iraq which is on the brink of a civil war , " astrid van genderen stort , a spokeswoman for the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , told the afp news agency . countries near iraq have even higher numbers of refugees .
there were more than 700,000 iraqi refugees in jordan , at least 600,000 in syria and 100,000 in egypt , according to the unhcr . sweden most popular destination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sectarian fighing has made life in iraq increasingly difficult sweden remains the top european destination because of its generous refugee policies and because many iraqis are already there , having emigrated there in the 1990s . approximately 79,200 iraqis now call sweden home , making them the second-largest immigrant group after finns .
iraqi asylum seekers are of all religious and ethnic backgrounds , van genderen stort said . " sweden has the reputation of being a humane country , a safe and democratic country that respects human rights , " said hikmet hussain , the head of the iraqi federation in sweden . in sweden , refugees can easily get residency permits .
some 80 to 90 percent of requests have been approved since january , afp reported . rest of europe less welcoming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhannad yousif while most european countries do n't deport iraqis , many let them stay but deny them residency permits .
in switzerland , the primarily iraqi kurdish refugees are offered accommodation in a refugee center and are allowed to stay temporarily , said dominique boillat , a spokeswoman for the swiss immigration authority . " they know we wo n't send them back , " boillat said . in germany , where 1,918 iraqis sought asylum in the first 11 months of 2006 , only 1 to 2 percent are accepted , according to the government . in denmark , a staunch ally of the united states in the iraq war , 80 percent of the 650 iraqi asylum seekers are in the process of being deported . krister isaksson , an analyst at the swedish migration board , said the numbers of iraqis in some european countries might be higher .
but many choose to remain illegal because they believe their asylum request will be denied . " this is how sweden is different , " isaksson said .
" in sweden , they opt to seek asylum because they are likely to get permission to stay . " isaksson said she does n't expect the number of iraqi asylum seekers to decrease in the near future . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : pope calls on germany to respect christian asylum seekers pope benedict xvi has called on germanyy to respect the rights of refugees , particularly those of christians .

the recycling industry body , wrap , says the benefit of keeping waste out of landfill sites has been equivalent to taking 3.5m cars off the road .
but its report cites major problems , including a shortage of high quality centres to sort recyclable materials .
recycling has nearly doubled to 27 % of all materials in the past three years .
however , the uk is still lagging behind most of its european neighbours in this area .
the bbc 's roger harrabin said pressure from the eu and the shortage of landfill sites had contributed to the increase in recycling .
however , he added the amount of recycling in the uk must nearly double again to meet new european targets .
as well as a shortage of sorting centres , wrap 's report is expected to say that some centres are turning out sub-standard products .
it follows a separate study by mintel which found that householders have started to lead greener lifestyles over the last year , by doing more recycling and turning off appliances .
however , the survey of 2,200 people found holidays abroad and car travel were harder habits to break .

the ship , built in 1911 , will move from its current dock at harland and wolff to barnett 's dock later .
the vessel , which arrived in belfast in july from le havre in france , will undergo some repair work .
the nomadic was designed to carry mainly first class passengers to the titanic and sister ship the olympic .
it will be covered to protect her from the harsh winter elements during the repair work .
denis rooney of the nomadic trust said friday marked " the next step in our preparations to provide a permanent home for nomadic " .
" at present , our priority is to ensure that our inclement winter weather does not cause any further deterioration to the structure .
" we will be carrying out some first aid repairs in the coming weeks and the vessel will then be covered . "
a picture of the nomadic taken from a helicopter above belfast social development minister david hanson said the ship 's transfer was an important step in moving the restoration project forward .
he said he wanted to express his appreciation to harland and wolff and belfast harbour commissioners for providing berths for the nomadic .
the government has spent almost £ 700,000 just buying and getting the ship back to belfast .
the charitable trust was set up to oversee and raise funds for nomadic 's restoration .
' built the titanic ' since the nomadic 's return thousands of people from all over the world have been asking when they can come and see her .
campaigners say there is no doubt she will prove her worth as a tourist attraction .
the nomadic 's return to belfast was almost a century after it was built by harland and wolff , the company which also built the titanic .
the nomadic as she looked early in the 20th century it was commissioned by the famous white star line and used to take first and second class passengers out to titanic at cherbourg in 1912 .
the titanic entered legend when it sank with the loss of more than 1,500 people on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york , but the nomadic 's story continued .
it saw out the end of the century as a floating restaurant beside the eiffel tower in paris before being sent for storage in le havre .

the price cuts were designed to lure customers away from rival western ferries , which has claimed the move was in breach of uk and european rules .
the gourock to dunoon route is the only one where calmac faces competition .
its service receives a subsidy of more than £ 2m from the scottish executive , which owns the ferry company .
the subsidy is only meant to support foot passengers , with vehicle tariffs left to face market forces .
now the executive has conceded that calmac has used the subsidy to underwrite discounts of up to 70 % to hauliers .
western ferries is calling on audit scotland to investigate the matter .
an executive spokesman indicated that ministers had been unaware of the discounts , which have now been stopped .

the women 's health initiative study was stopped in 2002 amid concerns over raised heart disease and cancer risk .
but now other us experts say the whi may have covered the wrong age group and used the wrong dose of hrt .
they hope a new study will pinpoint those women at risk of heart disease who would benefit from hormone therapy .
we think there are a group of women who might benefit from early intervention professor virginia miller , mayo clinic women are protected against all forms of cardiovascular disease , including heart disease , stroke and high blood pressure , until the menopause .
but their risk then rises to be the same as men 's ' .
this has led researchers to conclude the sex hormone oestrogen , levels of which fall after the menopause , must be involved .
animal studies have shown this is the case .
but the women 's health initiative , a study of 16,000 women , found hormone therapy had no benefit - and may even be harmful .
it found the risk of heart attack was doubled in women taking a combined form of hrt , and the risk of blood clots was doubled .
the whi also found a 26 % higher risk of breast cancer in the women .
right age group but the average age of women in the whi study was 63 - a decade later than the average menopause .
virginia miller , professor of surgery and physiology at the mayo clinic college of medicine , who is one of the researchers in the new eight-centre keeps study , said that was too late , and women may already have an increased heart disease risk .
" if you start treatment 10 years later , that 's 10 years where damage has been accumulating . "
the keeps study will look at over 700 healthy women aged 42 to 58 who have recently gone through the menopause and are already taking hormone replacement medication .
it will also compare oral oestrogen treatment and patch therapy .
dr miller said : " it 's important that we look at the right age group , use a lower dose than in the whi study and compare the two forms of oestrogen therapy .
" we think there are a group of women who might benefit from early intervention .
keep will also monitor the progression of any cardiovascular disease that does develop in the women , and will carry out yearly mammograms to check if breast cancers are forming or being fuelled by the hormone therapy .
it will also look at the bone health and the women 's ' mental abilities , which might also be affected by hormone levels .
hormonal effect professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said that while evidence had shown women were protected from heart disease up to the menopause , suggesting hormones might have a protective effect , it was also known that female hormones could increase the risk of developing blood clots .
if a woman already had fatty deposits in the arteries , hrt might increase the risk of a blood clot developing , which could cause a heart attack , he warned .
professor weissberg added : " it is probable that many of the women participating in previous trials into hrt already had atherosclerosis before they started taking hrt , which lead to an increased risk of a heart attack .
" with heart and circulatory disease being the biggest killer in the uk , we welcome the keeps study which aims to monitor women closely with new imaging techniques to search for early signs of fatty deposits .
" the trial may establish whether hrt can protect against heart disease if treatment is started early enough . "

the women 's health initiative study was stopped in 2002 amid concerns over raised heart disease and cancer risk .
but now other us experts say the whi may have covered the wrong age group and used the wrong dose of hrt .
they hope a new study will pinpoint those women at risk of heart disease who would benefit from hormone therapy .
we think there are a group of women who might benefit from early intervention professor virginia miller , mayo clinic women are protected against all forms of cardiovascular disease , including heart disease , stroke and high blood pressure , until the menopause .
but their risk then rises to be the same as men 's ' .
this has led researchers to conclude the sex hormone oestrogen , levels of which fall after the menopause , must be involved .
animal studies have shown this is the case .
but the women 's health initiative , a study of 16,000 women , found hormone therapy had no benefit - and may even be harmful .
it found the risk of heart attack was doubled in women taking a combined form of hrt , and the risk of blood clots was doubled .
the whi also found a 26 % higher risk of breast cancer in the women .
right age group but the average age of women in the whi study was 63 - a decade later than the average menopause .
virginia miller , professor of surgery and physiology at the mayo clinic college of medicine , who is one of the researchers in the new eight-centre keeps study , said that was too late , and women may already have an increased heart disease risk .
" if you start treatment 10 years later , that 's 10 years where damage has been accumulating . "
the keeps study will look at over 700 healthy women aged 42 to 58 who have recently gone through the menopause and are already taking hormone replacement medication .
it will also compare oral oestrogen treatment and patch therapy .
dr miller said : " it 's important that we look at the right age group , use a lower dose than in the whi study and compare the two forms of oestrogen therapy .
" we think there are a group of women who might benefit from early intervention .
keep will also monitor the progression of any cardiovascular disease that does develop in the women , and will carry out yearly mammograms to check if breast cancers are forming or being fuelled by the hormone therapy .
it will also look at the bone health and the women 's ' mental abilities , which might also be affected by hormone levels .
hormonal effect professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said that while evidence had shown women were protected from heart disease up to the menopause , suggesting hormones might have a protective effect , it was also known that female hormones could increase the risk of developing blood clots .
if a woman already had fatty deposits in the arteries , hrt might increase the risk of a blood clot developing , which could cause a heart attack , he warned .
professor weissberg added : " it is probable that many of the women participating in previous trials into hrt already had atherosclerosis before they started taking hrt , which lead to an increased risk of a heart attack .

but can he still go the distance ?
he has survived countless beatings , financial ruin and even brain damage .
but battling boxer rocky balboa is still out there swinging .
even so , sylvester stallone 's decision to revive his best-known character 30 years after his oscar-winning heyday may well be one rematch too far .
" who is rocky fighting this time - incontinence ? " joked us chat show host jay leno when news of a sixth instalment surfaced .
stallone , however , is taking such criticism in his stride , acknowledging his hero 's advancing years as he makes one last bid for glory .
ever since rocky made his cinema debut in 1976 , his career has been inextricably linked with the man who plays him .
persistence having written a script about a philadelphia leg-breaker given an unlikely chance to fight the reigning world heavyweight , stallone refused to sell it unless he played the role .
the studio wanted burt reynolds , james caan or ryan o 'neal , but the 30-year-old new yorker stuck to his guns .
the reward for his persistence was overnight fame , phenomenal success and 10 academy award nominations .
rocky went on to win three oscars in all , for best direction , editing and picture .
its success in the latter category came at the expense of such acclaimed modern classics as taxi driver , network and all the president 's men .
stallone was nominated for his acting and screenplay , while co-stars burt young , talia shire and burgess meredith were all shortlisted for their performances .
' waxy feeling ' all went on to reprise their roles in rocky ii , this time directed by stallone himself .
released in 1979 , the film saw balboa and nemesis apollo creed -lrb- carl weathers -rrb- strap on their gloves for a title fight rematch .
but while audiences came to see rocky 's return in their droves , critics and awards bodies were less impressed .
" rocky ii has a waxy feeling , and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did , " wrote janet maslin in the new york times .
a similar response met rocky iii in 1982 , which saw stallone go toe-to-toe with aggressive new challenger clubber lang - played by the a-team 's mr t. not half as aggressive , though , as the critics were towards rocky iv , which saw stallone trade blows with a man mountain from the soviet union -lrb- dolph lundgren -rrb- .
" the rocky series is finally losing its legs , " rued roger ebert in the chicago sun-times , dismissing stallone 's fourth outing as " movie-making by numbers " .
lean period by this time , of course , the actor-director was a dab hand at roman numerals , having initiated a rival franchise involving volatile vietnam veteran john rambo .
with both rambo iii and rocky v floundering at the box office , however , it seemed that audience had finally tired of their muscle-bound star .
the 1990s were a lean period for stallone , his attempts to sustain a career away from his two most familiar guises resulting in a string of flops .
small wonder , then , that rocky balboa will be followed in 2008 by a fourth rambo picture , provisionally titled pearl of the cobra .
so far reviewers have been kinder to rocky 's belated comeback than the earlier sequels , the hollywood reporter applauding " a low-key , stripped-down production that really does come close to capturing the heart and soul of the original " .
it remains to be seen , however , whether audiences in the us and elsewhere will be as keen to celebrate the return of a character so steeped in iconography and cliché .
rocky balboa is out now in the us and opens in the uk on 19 january .

the agreement reached by tessa jowell and gordon brown has not yet been approved by tony blair .
under the plan , the fee would rise by 3 % next year and the year after , and 2 % for the following three years .
the retail price index is currently 3.9 % .
the decision would mean the licence fee rising to £ 135.45 next year from its current level of £ 131.50 .
by 2012 , the cost of a tv licence is set to be between £ 148.05 and £ 151 .
the level of increase is unclear for year six , because of the uncertainty over the financial cost of the changeover from analogue to digital tv .
that is well below the amount that the bbc had wanted viewers to pay - which included inflation-busting increases taking the figure to as much as £ 180 over seven years .
the bbc said discussions continued and it awaited an announcement in the new year .
new stance the agreement would mean the bbc had failed to convince ministers of its case for an above-inflation increase , which it has often enjoyed in the past .
the settlement would also bring the bbc more closely into line with other public sector bodies , as the licence fee will not be linked to inflation at all in future .
bbc media correspondent torin douglas said it asked for the above-inflation rise to help pay for better programmes and the switch to digital television .
he added that the increase was also intended to pay for the move of many staff and programmes to salford in greater manchester .
bbc licence fee rises now : £ 131.50 year 1 : £ 135.45 , up 3 % year 2 : £ 139.51 , up 3 % year 3 : £ 142.20 , up 2 % year 4 : £ 145.15 , up 2 % year 5 : £ 148.05 , up 2 % year 6 - £ 148.05- £ 151 , 0-2 % rise sources at the department of culture , media and sport said that the treasury had originally hoped to secure a settlement of 1.5 % below inflation .
they added that as a result of their negotiations , they had secured about £ 1bn in additional funds over the next six years for the broadcaster .
however , the new fee agreement is expected to lead to the bbc cutting back on many of its plans , though it is not clear which ones .
ms jowell told parliament this week that £ 600m to help elderly people switch to digital television would be ring-fenced and that the bbc 's manchester move should be able to go ahead under the settlement .
' big questions ' conservative shadow culture spokesman hugo swire added that the deal was a " huge defeat " for ms jowell , adding she had led the bbc to believe it would get a generous settlement .
he added : " the big questions now are what comes off the menu agreed between the government and bbc during the charter renewal process , if the bbc can deliver on all they have been told to by the government , and was the original figure submitted by the bbc grossly inflated ? "
but bbc business editor robert peston said the deal meant the licence fee would rise broadly in line with the headline rate of inflation - the consumer price index , which excludes mortgage payments .
" in theory this is less than inflation , in the sense that retail price index is 3.9 % at the moment .
and i am sure the treasury will claim this as a tough settlement , " he said .
" but on a running cpi basis , i think it can be seen as broadly in line with inflation - the bank of england 's cpi target rate is 2 % . "
news of the deal comes just weeks after michael grade quit as bbc chairman during key talks over the licence fee .

the bbc said discussions continued and it awaited an announcement in the new year .
new stance the agreement would mean the bbc had failed to convince ministers of its case for an above-inflation increase , which it has often enjoyed in the past .
the settlement would also bring the bbc more closely into line with other public sector bodies , as the licence fee will not be linked to inflation at all in future .
bbc media correspondent torin douglas said it asked for the above-inflation rise to help pay for better programmes and the switch to digital television .
he added that the increase was also intended to pay for the move of many staff and programmes to salford in greater manchester .
bbc licence fee rises now : £ 131.50 year 1 : £ 135.45 , up 3 % year 2 : £ 139.51 , up 3 % year 3 : £ 142.20 , up 2 % year 4 : £ 145.15 , up 2 % year 5 : £ 148.05 , up 2 % year 6 - £ 148.05- £ 151 , 0-2 % rise sources at the department of culture , media and sport said that the treasury had originally hoped to secure a settlement of 1.5 % below inflation .
they added that as a result of their negotiations , they had secured about £ 1bn in additional funds over the next six years for the broadcaster .
however , the new fee agreement is expected to lead to the bbc cutting back on many of its plans , though it is not clear which ones .
ms jowell told parliament this week that £ 600m to help elderly people switch to digital television would be ring-fenced and that the bbc 's manchester move should be able to go ahead under the settlement .
' big questions ' conservative shadow culture spokesman hugo swire added that the deal was a " huge defeat " for ms jowell , adding she had led the bbc to believe it would get a generous settlement .
he added : " the big questions now are what comes off the menu agreed between the government and bbc during the charter renewal process , if the bbc can deliver on all they have been told to by the government , and was the original figure submitted by the bbc grossly inflated ? "
but bbc business editor robert peston said the deal meant the licence fee would rise broadly in line with the headline rate of inflation - the consumer price index , which excludes mortgage payments .
" in theory this is less than inflation , in the sense that retail price index is 3.9 % at the moment .
and i am sure the treasury will claim this as a tough settlement , " he said .
" but on a running cpi basis , i think it can be seen as broadly in line with inflation - the bank of england 's cpi target rate is 2 % . "

the mobile phone giant is widely expected to offer as much as $ 13.5bn -lrb- £ 6.9bn -rrb- for hutchison essar but it warned a deal might not materialise .
the move would be consistent with its strategy of expanding in fast-moving markets to offset slow european growth .
vodafone is set to face competition from other potential suitors including india 's reliance communications .
vodafone 's shares fell 1 % in early london trading amid concerns that it would have to overpay to acquire the prized asset .
hong-kong based hutchison telecommunications revealed on friday that several parties had contacted it about acquiring its 67 % stake in hutchison essar - india 's fourth-largest mobile phone operator . "
vodafone continues to believe the mobile market in india has great potential " vodafone vodafone already owns 10 % of bharti airtel , the market leader in india , but is keen to build a more substantial presence in the world 's fastest growing telecoms market .
foreign firms are limited to owning 74 % of indian mobile phone providers .
vodafone said it was considering whether the deal met its criteria , both in terms of how much it would have to pay and its strategic implications .
" vodafone continues to believe the mobile market in india has great potential and is therefore considering the acquisition of a controlling interest in hutchison essar , " it said .
" such a consideration would be consistent with its stated strategy of seeking selective acquisition opportunities in developing markets . "
other contenders vodafone currently has interests in emerging markets including egypt , romania and india - and underlined its ambitions for further expansion in similar markets at an investor meeting earlier this month .
it is focusing on countries with major growth potential after exiting more mature markets such as japan , belgium and switzerland over the past year .
essar group , a conglomerate whose interests include construction and shipping as well as telecoms , has first refusal on buying the 67 % stake , should hutchison sell .
indian media reports have suggested that malaysian telecoms firm maxis and egypt 's orascom telecom are also interested in investing in hutchison essar .

this year there has been remarkably little fuss made over the continued growth of online shopping for christmas presents , perhaps because we 've finally reached the point where it is just a normal part of our lives .
after years of effusive headlines - the bbc had " internet shopping set for new record " in december 2002 , and " e-commerce set for xmas bonanza " in 2003 - we seem finally to have accepted that the network is here to stay and settled down to use it .
but just buying groceries or presents online , or sending electronic gift certificates at the last minute , is only part of the story .
the network is changing our lives in many other ways , and we often do n't notice them .
only connect in the last month the frictionless nature of the global electronic economy has been brought home to me in several small interactions that reveal , by their simplicity and straightforwardness , just how connected we have all become .
the first was on a recent trip to liverpool .
i went into the starbucks opposite the town hall for a coffee , and at the till i fished out a starbucks card .
these are all over the place at the moment , as the coffee chain realises that if we 've got one of its pre-paid cards we 're more likely to resist the blandishments of its rivals . ... while the economy may be frictionless it is not yet a level playing field bill thompson i gave it to the cashier , she swiped it through the till , and i got £ 2.75 off my bill for a latte and a croissant .
so far , so boring .
but the card i used had n't come from a uk shop .
it was a free $ 5 card that had been handed to me by a roller-skating worker last june as i was watching the brooklyn gay pride parade on seventh avenue .
somewhere in the vast databank that is the starbucks customer management system it probably registered the fact that a $ 5 card from brooklyn had been used in liverpool , but there was no problem with this , and i got my coffee .
shortly afterwards i had another hint of how things are going , this time in london .
i often swing by the apple store on regent street when i 've got some time to kill .
it 's warm , it 's out of the rain and it has free wireless .
sometimes , i confess , i succumb to temptation and buy some hardware , though often i manage to call my technology counsellor , simon , and he talks me out of it by telling me to wait for one of the cool toys that are soon to be launched .
many firms are using wireless tech to shorten queues but not always .
a couple of weeks ago i was queuing up to get one of the new -lrb- red -rrb- nanos for my daughter when one of the staff sidled up to me and asked if i had a credit card and an e-mail address .
it was n't , as i rather hoped , an invitation to pre-christmas debauchery but an offer of service of a different , more practical , kind .
he had a wireless terminal with him and swiped my credit card , typed in my e-mail and gave me the ipod .
my invoice was e-mailed to me and i saved 10 minutes of queuing and a sheet of a4 paper .
at cambridge train station mike , the ticket inspector - or perhaps he 's a " revenue protection officer " these days - will sell me a ticket if the queues are too long , and he can do chip and pin authorisation with a cute little bluetooth-enabled keypad .
i have n't asked him what the security protocols are yet , but i 'm usually the only hairy hacker with a beard standing on the platform so i think i 'm probably safe .
and it has just happened again .
as i sat on the train from leeds to manchester writing this article i was asked for my ticket .
it was n't to check whether it was valid , but for a customer survey .
the man wandering down the aisle was entering the ticket type , origin and destination into a handheld computer , building up a quick passenger survey far faster and more reliably than the survey cards they keep handing out on london buses could ever achieve - and with a lot less waste .
living wires all of these examples show that the network is being embedded into the design of information systems , and how this can be used to enhance customer service , improve the quality of our interactions with organisations of all sizes and types .
of course it is n't all perfect , and there will continue to be network-assisted disasters as we are currently seeing in the fallout from the over-ambitious offers of free broadband by carphone warehouse , where customers are complaining and waiting far too long to be connected .
data networks are spreading their tentacles everywhere and we are still sometimes being ripped off by new technology .
everyone knows that electronic transactions are cheaper than having people answering phones because the customer is doing the data entry that would otherwise have to be paid for .
everyone knows that paperless systems save money , if only on paper , ink and getting someone to go round and replace cartridges or tickets .
yet ncp , which runs the parking at cambridge station and many other railway stations around the country , charge a 20p fee for anyone who chooses to use its text-based parking service instead of shovelling cash into a ticket machine .
it 's the same with cinemas , theatres and gigs , where electronic booking costs as much as doing it over the phone .
finally , while the economy may be frictionless it is not yet a level playing field .
apple may have the coolest paperless payment system around , but my red nano still cost a lot more in pounds than i would have had to pay in dollars if i 'd been in brooklyn .
mind you , the coffee would have been the same price , so i suppose things could be worse .

this year there has been remarkably little fuss made over the continued growth of online shopping for christmas presents , perhaps because we 've finally reached the point where it is just a normal part of our lives .
after years of effusive headlines - the bbc had " internet shopping set for new record " in december 2002 , and " e-commerce set for xmas bonanza " in 2003 - we seem finally to have accepted that the network is here to stay and settled down to use it .
but just buying groceries or presents online , or sending electronic gift certificates at the last minute , is only part of the story .
the network is changing our lives in many other ways , and we often do n't notice them .
only connect in the last month the frictionless nature of the global electronic economy has been brought home to me in several small interactions that reveal , by their simplicity and straightforwardness , just how connected we have all become .
the first was on a recent trip to liverpool .
i went into the starbucks opposite the town hall for a coffee , and at the till i fished out a starbucks card .
these are all over the place at the moment , as the coffee chain realises that if we 've got one of its pre-paid cards we 're more likely to resist the blandishments of its rivals . ... while the economy may be frictionless it is not yet a level playing field bill thompson i gave it to the cashier , she swiped it through the till , and i got £ 2.75 off my bill for a latte and a croissant .
so far , so boring .
but the card i used had n't come from a uk shop .
it was a free $ 5 card that had been handed to me by a roller-skating worker last june as i was watching the brooklyn gay pride parade on seventh avenue .
somewhere in the vast databank that is the starbucks customer management system it probably registered the fact that a $ 5 card from brooklyn had been used in liverpool , but there was no problem with this , and i got my coffee .
shortly afterwards i had another hint of how things are going , this time in london .
i often swing by the apple store on regent street when i 've got some time to kill .
it 's warm , it 's out of the rain and it has free wireless .
sometimes , i confess , i succumb to temptation and buy some hardware , though often i manage to call my technology counsellor , simon , and he talks me out of it by telling me to wait for one of the cool toys that are soon to be launched .
many firms are using wireless tech to shorten queues but not always .
a couple of weeks ago i was queuing up to get one of the new -lrb- red -rrb- nanos for my daughter when one of the staff sidled up to me and asked if i had a credit card and an e-mail address .
it was n't , as i rather hoped , an invitation to pre-christmas debauchery but an offer of service of a different , more practical , kind .
he had a wireless terminal with him and swiped my credit card , typed in my e-mail and gave me the ipod .
my invoice was e-mailed to me and i saved 10 minutes of queuing and a sheet of a4 paper .
at cambridge train station mike , the ticket inspector - or perhaps he 's a " revenue protection officer " these days - will sell me a ticket if the queues are too long , and he can do chip and pin authorisation with a cute little bluetooth-enabled keypad .
i have n't asked him what the security protocols are yet , but i 'm usually the only hairy hacker with a beard standing on the platform so i think i 'm probably safe .
and it has just happened again .
as i sat on the train from leeds to manchester writing this article i was asked for my ticket .
it was n't to check whether it was valid , but for a customer survey .

this year there has been remarkably little fuss made over the continued growth of online shopping for christmas presents , perhaps because we 've finally reached the point where it is just a normal part of our lives .
after years of effusive headlines - the bbc had " internet shopping set for new record " in december 2002 , and " e-commerce set for xmas bonanza " in 2003 - we seem finally to have accepted that the network is here to stay and settled down to use it .
but just buying groceries or presents online , or sending electronic gift certificates at the last minute , is only part of the story .
the network is changing our lives in many other ways , and we often do n't notice them .
only connect in the last month the frictionless nature of the global electronic economy has been brought home to me in several small interactions that reveal , by their simplicity and straightforwardness , just how connected we have all become .
the first was on a recent trip to liverpool .
i went into the starbucks opposite the town hall for a coffee , and at the till i fished out a starbucks card .
these are all over the place at the moment , as the coffee chain realises that if we 've got one of its pre-paid cards we 're more likely to resist the blandishments of its rivals . ... while the economy may be frictionless it is not yet a level playing field bill thompson i gave it to the cashier , she swiped it through the till , and i got £ 2.75 off my bill for a latte and a croissant .
so far , so boring .
but the card i used had n't come from a uk shop .
it was a free $ 5 card that had been handed to me by a roller-skating worker last june as i was watching the brooklyn gay pride parade on seventh avenue .
somewhere in the vast databank that is the starbucks customer management system it probably registered the fact that a $ 5 card from brooklyn had been used in liverpool , but there was no problem with this , and i got my coffee .
shortly afterwards i had another hint of how things are going , this time in london .
i often swing by the apple store on regent street when i 've got some time to kill .
it 's warm , it 's out of the rain and it has free wireless .
sometimes , i confess , i succumb to temptation and buy some hardware , though often i manage to call my technology counsellor , simon , and he talks me out of it by telling me to wait for one of the cool toys that are soon to be launched .
many firms are using wireless tech to shorten queues but not always .
a couple of weeks ago i was queuing up to get one of the new -lrb- red -rrb- nanos for my daughter when one of the staff sidled up to me and asked if i had a credit card and an e-mail address .
it was n't , as i rather hoped , an invitation to pre-christmas debauchery but an offer of service of a different , more practical , kind .
he had a wireless terminal with him and swiped my credit card , typed in my e-mail and gave me the ipod .
my invoice was e-mailed to me and i saved 10 minutes of queuing and a sheet of a4 paper .
at cambridge train station mike , the ticket inspector - or perhaps he 's a " revenue protection officer " these days - will sell me a ticket if the queues are too long , and he can do chip and pin authorisation with a cute little bluetooth-enabled keypad .
i have n't asked him what the security protocols are yet , but i 'm usually the only hairy hacker with a beard standing on the platform so i think i 'm probably safe .
and it has just happened again .
as i sat on the train from leeds to manchester writing this article i was asked for my ticket .
it was n't to check whether it was valid , but for a customer survey .
the man wandering down the aisle was entering the ticket type , origin and destination into a handheld computer , building up a quick passenger survey far faster and more reliably than the survey cards they keep handing out on london buses could ever achieve - and with a lot less waste .
living wires all of these examples show that the network is being embedded into the design of information systems , and how this can be used to enhance customer service , improve the quality of our interactions with organisations of all sizes and types .
of course it is n't all perfect , and there will continue to be network-assisted disasters as we are currently seeing in the fallout from the over-ambitious offers of free broadband by carphone warehouse , where customers are complaining and waiting far too long to be connected .
data networks are spreading their tentacles everywhere and we are still sometimes being ripped off by new technology .
everyone knows that electronic transactions are cheaper than having people answering phones because the customer is doing the data entry that would otherwise have to be paid for .
everyone knows that paperless systems save money , if only on paper , ink and getting someone to go round and replace cartridges or tickets .
yet ncp , which runs the parking at cambridge station and many other railway stations around the country , charge a 20p fee for anyone who chooses to use its text-based parking service instead of shovelling cash into a ticket machine .
it 's the same with cinemas , theatres and gigs , where electronic booking costs as much as doing it over the phone .
finally , while the economy may be frictionless it is not yet a level playing field .
apple may have the coolest paperless payment system around , but my red nano still cost a lot more in pounds than i would have had to pay in dollars if i 'd been in brooklyn .
mind you , the coffee would have been the same price , so i suppose things could be worse .
